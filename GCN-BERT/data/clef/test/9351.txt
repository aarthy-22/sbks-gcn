CYCLOHEXENYL COMPOUNDS, COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING THEM AND USES THEREOF FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to phenyl substituted cyclohexenyl compounds, compositions comprising them and uses thereof for the preparation of medicaments. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Cannabidiol (CBD), a constituent of Cannabis sativa, is the major non- psychotropic cannabinoid. CBD has been shown in in vitro assays, as well as in in vivo assays to produce numerous pharmacological effects, some of which are of high potential therapeutic value. For example, effects of CBD were associated with the treatment of neurological diseases, anxiety and psychosis. CBD was also found to be a neuroprotective antioxidant. The in vitro effects of CBD on immune cells was also shown, such as the inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) production by mouse peritoneal macrophages and the suppression of TNF-a, IL-la and IFNy by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These in vitro studies lend support to earlier reports on analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of CBD in animals. CBD was also shown to have very limited anti-obesity effect. Ignatowska- Jankowska et al. {Neurosci Lett. 2011, 490, 82-4) have shown that CBD decreases body weight gain in rats through involvement of CB2 receptors. However, Scopinho et al., {Pharmacol Biochem Behav. 2011, 98, 268-272) report that CBD did not change food intake in fed or fasted rats.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS Preparation of 3-methoxy-2-((6R)-3-methyl-6-(prop-l-en-2-yl)cyclohex-2-enyl)-5- pentylphenyl 3-morpholinopropanoate (HU-435): 3-Methoxy-2-((6R)-3-methyl-6-(prop-l-en-2-yl)cyclohex-2-enyl)-5- pentylphenyl 3-morpholinopropanoate (HU-435) was prepared from plant-derived cannabidiol which was converted to mono-methoxy CBD. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC, 3.2 mmoles) was added to 4-morpholino propionic acid (3.2 mmoles), mono- methoxy CBD (1.6 mmoles) and pyrrolidinopyridine (0.32 mmoles) in dry CH2CI2 (20 ml). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight (precipitation of dicyclohexylurea, DCU, was seen within 10 minutes). The DCU was filtered and the solution was concentrated and purified on silica gel column using 50 % ether in petroleum ether as eluent. HU-435 was afforded at a 28 % yield. NMR (500 MHz, in CDCI3): δ ppm: 6.52 (1H, s), 6.41 (1H, s), 5.20 (1H, s), 4.47 (1H, s). 4.39, (1H, s), 3.72- 3.67 (7H, m), 2.85-2.40 (9H, m), 2.20-1.95, (2H, m), 1.65, (3H, s), 1.59, (3H, s), 1.30- 1.22, (6H, m), 0.86, (3H, t). Preparation of the maleate salt of 3-methoxy-2-((6R)-3-methyl-6-(prop-l-en-2- yl)cyclohex-2-enyl)-5-pentylphenyl 3-morpholinopropanoate (HU-436): The maleate salt of HU-435 (HU-436) was prepared by stirring a solution of maleic acid (0.247 mmoles) and HU-435 (0.247 mmoles) in 20 ml 2-propanol at room temperature for 2.5 hours. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure and the oil obtained was crystallized from ethyl acetate and ether to afford the salt HU-436 (melting point 110-112 °C) at a yield of 80 %. NMR (500 MHz, in CDCI3): δ ppm: 6.53, (1H, s), 6.35, (1H, s), 6.31, (2H, s), 5.16 (1H, s), 4.44, (1H, s), 4.36, (1H, s), 3.97 (4H, m), 3.74, (3H, s), 3.35-2.6 (6H, m), 2.50-2.55 (2H, t), 1.63, (3H, s), 1.59 (3H, s), 1.30-1.22 (6H, m), 0.86, (3H, t). In vitro Studies Macrophages Peritoneal cells were harvested from C57BL/6 female mice 4 days after intraperitoneal injection of 1.5 mL of 3% thioglycoUate medium (Difco). The cells (TG macrophages) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, re-suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS), and plated (1.2 x 105) in 96-microwell flat-bottom plates (Nunc, Roskide, Denmark). Following 2-3 h incubation at 37°C, the non-adherent cells were removed by intensive rinsing. About 95% of the adherent cells were macrophages. These cells were applied for studying TNF production in-vitro. Raw 264.7 Macrophage Cell Line Raw 264.7 cells, a monocytic-macrophage cell line derived from BALB/c mice, were obtained from American Type Culture collection (Rockville, MD). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) and sodium pyrovate, glutamine, and antibiotics. For activation, the cells were incubated with LPS (E. coli 1 μg/mL for 24 h, Sigma, Israel). These cells were applied for ROI and Nitric Oxide (NO) generation in-vitro. Reactive oxygen intermediate (ROI) production by Raw 264.7 Macrophages Raw 264.7 cells were removed using a scrapper, washed, and re-suspended in Hanks balanced salt solution (without phenol red). For measurement of chemiluminescence, two luminometer tubes were each loaded with: 0.5 mL of cell suspension (5x 105 cells), HU-436 (two separate doses in each tube of 40 μg/ml and 60μg/ml), 10 luminol (Sigma) and 30 of zymosan (Sigma). The chemiluminescence in each tube was measured immediately thereafter by a luminometer (Biolumate LB 95, Berhold, Wilbad, Germany). The results of the chmiluminescence measurements of the two tubes demonstrated an inhibition of 20% and 28% of ROI generation fallowing incubation with 40 μg/ml and 60 μg/ml HU-436, respectively. Nitric Oxide (NO) production by RAW 264.7 macrophages RAW 264.7 macrophages were treated with various doses (l-60μg/ml) of HU- 436 followed the addition of 1 μg/mL of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, E. coli, Sigma) for activation. The macrophages were then cultivated in a humid atmosphere with 5% CO2 for 24 h. NO generation was determined by measuring the nitrite accumulated in the super of the HU-436-treated macrophages as follows: An equal volume (100 eagent (1% sulfanilamide, 0.1% naphthalene diamine HC1, 2% H3PO4) was added to each supernatant. Following 10 min of incubation at room temperature, the color production was measured at 550 nm with an ELISA reader. The concentration of nitrite was calculated according to a standard curve. The results are presented in Fig.1 wherein inhibition of more than 50% was found fallowing incubation of the cells with 60μg/ml HU-436. TNF-α Determination TNF-α in the supernatants of TG macrophages treated with HU-436 (doses of 5- 40μΙ7πιΙ) and LPS was determined by ELISA (R&D) with Ab pairs from Biosource (Camarillo, CA). Procedures were carried out following the manufacturer's instructions. As can be seen in Fig. 2 inhibition of more than 60% in TNF production was observed fallowing incubation of macrophages with 40μg/ml HU-436. In vivo Studies Three doses of HU-436 (lOmg/Kg, 20mg/Kg and 30mg/Kg) were each injected to three C57BL mice together with LPS. Ninety min fallowing the injections, the mice were bled and the TNF levels in the serum were determined. As can be seen in Fig.3, inhibition of 46% in TNF level was observed after treatment with a dose of 30mg/Kg of HU-436. It is noted that in preliminary toxicological studies in C57BL, doses of 50mg/Kg and lOOmg/Kg of HU-436 were found to be non-toxic. Weight Loss Studies Study 1 DBA/1 male mice (6 weeks old, 20 gram, 15 mice/group) were injected Type II collagen for CIA. On day 18, the mice were injected (intra-peritoneal) with the following doses, for 16 days: Vehicle: ethanol: chremophor: saline (1: 1 : 18) - Methrotrexate (MTX): 0.5mg/Kg. - HU-436: 2mg/Kg - HU-436: 5mg/Kg - HU-436: lOmg/Kg - HU-436: 20mg/Kg In addition, a control group (wherein no dose was given) was monitored for comparison. The changes in body weight (in grams) was measured daily for a period of 34 days from injection. Fig. 4 (days 18 - 34) and Fig. 5 (overall change from day 1 to 34), show the changes in body weight of mice over a period of 34 days from injection. A reduction of up to 61% of body weight was observed for a dose of 5 mg/Kg of HU- 436 (wherein the weight gain of the control group was measured as 100% gain). Study 2 Normal Sabra (mice 9-10 weeks old, about 32 gram,7 mice/group) were injected (intra-peritoneal) with two doses of HU-436 (5mg/Kg and lOmg/Kg). The change in weight of mice was measured daily for 15 (Fig. 6) and 24 days (Fig. 7) from injection. In addition, a control group (wherein no dose was given) was monitored for comparison. As can be seen in Fig. 6 and 7, administration of 5mg/Kg of HU-436 significantly decreased the changes in weight gain of mice. Study 3 C57BL/6 mice (8-9 weeks old, 16 gram, 5 mice/group) were injected (intraperitoneal) with two doses of HU-436 (5mg/Kg and lOmg/Kg). The change in weight of mice was measured weekly for three weeks (Figs. 8 and 9) from injection. In addition, a control group (wherein no dose was given) was monitored for comparison. Both doses of HU-436 showed a significant reduction (of about 50%) in weight gain compared to the control group (see Fig. 8). A reduction in food consumptin with both doses of HU- 436 was observed after 1-3 weeks (Fig. 9). Determination of depressive effect of HU436- forced swimming test To find out whether HU436 has depressive effects on mice behavior - a forced swimming test (FST) was adopted. Experimental: Female sabra mice 6-8 weeks old were employed. Measurement of locomotor activity in mice movements were counted for 6 minutes. Forced Swimming test (FST):The forced swimming test employed was essential similar to that described in ((Pettit -Demoulier et al, (2005) Psychopharmacology 177:245-255;) Mice were dropped individually into a glass aquarium (height 2.5 cm, diameter 10 cm) containing 10 cm of water and their activity was monitored for 6 minutes. Of the total 6 minutes only the last 4 minutes was recorded . - the first 2 minutes were considered as time for habitation . The mice were treated either with 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg of HU436 (ip). Mice were scored at 10 minutes 90 minutes or 180 minutes after administration. In addition to mice treated with vehicle as control, 1 mice was injected ip with 5mg/kg CBD and scored 10 minutes later. The movements /kicking of the mice were counted and the data are presented in the attached Table 1. The results clearly show similar locomotor pattern as measured by movement and kicking between subjects treated with HU436 as compared with control group. Additionally, it was shown that HU436 did not cause depressive activity in treated mice.

Zymosan injected to mice left hind paw, induced inflammation, TNF (tumor necrosis factor) in the serum as well as pain. During 24h, the inflammatory paw swelling response was assayed by caliper, whereas the pain in the hind paw, was determined by Von Frey monofiber instrument. Methods Sabra female, mice 6-7 weeks old, were employed. Zymosan 0.6 mgr in 40 micro-liters was injected into the left hind paw. Immediately thereafter 20 30, 50 or 100 mg/kg HU436 dissolved in olive oil, in 20μ1- was given orally. Two, six and twenty- four hours thereafter, the injected left hind paw of the mice (total 5-8 mice /treatment), were examined both for swelling (Inflammation) and pain (Von Frey). The levels of TNFa in the sera of Sabra mice were determined by Elisa, 24 hrs after HU-436 application. Results Inflammation Following ip injection of 20mg/kg HU-436 to Sabra female mice, (see Fig. 10A, 11 A, 12A) reduction in inflammatory response (swelling) was observed compared to controls. When HU-436 was given orally, in doses of 30 and 50 mg/kg it reduced inflammation compared to the controls (Figs. 13A, 14A and 15A). Cannabidiol (CBD) in all experiments was scientifically more potent than HU-436 in reducing inflammation. TNF Reduction of TNFa levels in the sera of Sabra mice, fallowing application of HU-436, mirrored the inflammation extend. Suppressing TNF titers in the sera of HU- 436 treated mice was smaller, up to 20%, compared to a reduction of 48-58% found in the sera of CBD -treated mice (Figs 16A-16B). Pain, was assayed by employing Von- Frey monofiber instrument. The higher the log value measured, the more force (g) one has to apply to cause pain=higher analgesia is being expressed=less pain. Data depicted in Figs 10 - 15, demonstrate a marked pain reduction of in all three HU-436 doses: 20, 30, 50 and 100 mg/kg, given orally. The higher pain reduction was detected, 24hr after treatment, showing long lasting effect of the drug. Comparing HU-436 (30 or 50 mg/kg) effect to that of Aspirin (50 and demonstrated that HU-436 was the most potent in reducing pain for 24hr. 50mg/kg HU436 was more potent after 24hr than Tremadol (5mg/kg) given intra-peritoneally. HU-436 given orally markedly decreased the pain perception in Sabra mice for an extended period of time. Conclusions HU-436 is a potent, long lasting anti-pain new remedy. HU-436 is more effective than Cannabidiol, Aspirin in reducing long lasting pain. HU-436 has moderate anti- inflammation properties with no observed dose response bell -shaped effect typical for other remedies in this field (where higher doses are less effective than lower doses). 1.
