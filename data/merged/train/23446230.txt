CYP2J2 overexpression increases EETs and protects against angiotensin II-induced abdominal aortic aneurysm in mice.
Cytochrome P450 epoxygenase 2J2 (CYP2J2) metabolizes arachidonic acids to form epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which possess various beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system.
However, whether increasing EETs production by CYP2J2 overexpression in vivo could prevent abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) remains unknown.
Here we investigated the effects of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-mediated CYP2J2 overexpression on angiotensin (Ang) II-induced AAA in apoE-deficient mice.
rAAV-CYP2J2 delivery led to an abundant aortic CYP2J2 expression and increased EETs generation.
It was shown that CYP2J2 overexpression attenuated matrix metalloproteinase expression and activity, elastin degradation, and AAA formation, which was associated with reduced aortic inflammation and macrophage infiltration.
In cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), rAAV-mediated CYP2J2 overexpression and EETs markedly suppressed Ang II-induced inflammatory cytokine expression.
Moreover, overexpressed CYP2J2 and EETs inhibited Ang II-induced macrophage migration in a VSMC-macrophage coculture system.
We further indicated that these protective effects were mediated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ activation.
Taken together, these results provide evidence that rAAV-mediated CYP2J2 overexpression prevents AAA development which is likely via PPARγ activation and anti-inflammatory action, suggesting that increasing EETs levels could be considered as a potential strategy to prevent and treat AAA.
