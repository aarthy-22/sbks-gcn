IFN-gamma-induced IDO and WRS expression in microglia is differentially regulated by IL-4.
Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), a tryptophan catabolizing enzyme, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders.
IDO expression is induced by IFN-gamma and leads to neurotoxicity by generating quinolinic acid.
Additionally, it inhibits the immune response through both tryptophan depletion and generating other tryptophan catabolites.
IL-4 and IL-13 have been shown to control IDO expression by antagonizing the effects of IFN-gamma in different cell types.
Here, we investigated the effects of these cytokines on IDO expression in microglia.
Interestingly, we observed that both IL-4 and IL-13 greatly enhanced IFN-gamma-induced IDO expression.
However, tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WRS), which is coinduced with IDO by IFN-gamma, is downregulated by IL-4 and IL-13.
The effect of IL-4 and IL-13 was independent of STAT-6.
Modulation of IDO but not WRS was eliminated by inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity.
The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway further differentiated the regulation of these two enzymes, as inhibiting the PI3K pathway eliminated IFN-gamma induction of IDO, whereas such inhibition greatly enhanced WRS expression.
These findings show discordance between modulations of expression of two distinct enzymes utilizing tryptophan as a common substrate, and raise the possibility of their involvement in regulating immune responses in various neurological disorders.
