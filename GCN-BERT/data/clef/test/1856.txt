Technical Field The present invention relates to curable resin compositions and cured products thereof. The present application claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2013-002104 filed to Japan on January 9, 2013, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Background Art In semiconductor devices requiring superior heat resistance and high breakdown voltage, semiconductor elements are covered or encapsulated by materials. These materials generally require such heat resistance as to endure heat at a temperature of about 150°C or higher. In particular, materials (encapsulants) to cover or encapsulate optical elements such as optical semiconductor elements require excellent physical properties such as transparency and flexibility, in addition to the heat resistance. Such encapsulants currently used typically in backlight units of liquid crystal displays are exemplified by epoxy resin materials and silicone resin materials. Patent Literature (PTL) 1 discloses a synthetic high-molecular compound as a material that is highly resistant to heat and dissipates heat satisfactorily. The synthetic high-molecular compound contains at least one third organosilicon polymer having a molecular weight of from 20000 to 800000. The third organosilicon polymer has been formed by linking at least one first organosilicon polymer with at least one second organosilicon polymer through siloxane bonds. The first organosilicon polymer includes a crosslinked siloxane structure, where the siloxane structure refers to a Si-O-Si bonded structure. The second organosilicon polymer includes a linear, linked siloxane structure. Materials of this type, however, are still lower in physical properties. PTL 2 discloses a resin composition for optical element encapsulation as a resin composition that has excellent transparency, ultraviolet resistance, and thermal coloration resistance and is used for the encapsulation of an optical element. The resin composition contains, as a resin component, at least one silsesquioxane selected from the group consisting of liquid silsesquioxanes including a cage-like structure, containing an aliphatic carbon-carbon unsaturated bond, and being devoid of H-Si bonds; and liquid silsesquioxanes including a cage-like structure, containing a H-Si bond, and being devoid of aliphatic carbon-carbon unsaturated bonds. Unfortunately, however, the resin composition containing such a cage-like silsesquioxane gives a cured product that is relatively rigid, is poorly flexible, and is susceptible to cracking and/or fracture. PTL 3 discloses a curable composition that essentially contains an organic compound containing at least two carbon-carbon double bonds per molecule, a compound containing at least two SiH groups per molecule, and a hydrosilylation catalyst, where the carbon-carbon double bonds are reactive with SiH groups. The organic compound is exemplified by triallyl isocyanurate. The compound containing at least two SiH groups per molecule is exemplified by chain and/or cyclic polyorganosiloxanes. Disadvantageously, however, materials of this type are still lower in physical properties such as cracking resistance. Citation List Patent Literature PTL 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication (JP-A) No. 2006-206721 PTL 2: JP-A No. 2007-031619 PTL 3: JP-A No. 2002-314140 Summary of Invention Technical Problem Encapsulants for optical semiconductor elements generally require, in addition to the properties, resistance to deterioration even upon the application of heat at a high temperature in a reflow process in the production of optical semiconductor devices. Specifically, the encapsulants require such properties as to resist cracking and not to cause troubles such as detachment from the package. These properties are also generically referred to as "reflow resistance". As used herein the term "cracking resistance" refers to such a property of an encapsulant as to resist cracking. In addition, the encapsulants for optical semiconductor elements require high barrier properties to a corrosive gas such as a SOx gas. This is because metal materials typically of electrodes in the optical semiconductor devices are readily corroded by the corrosive gas and, once corroded, disadvantageously deteriorate in electrical properties (e.g., electrical properties in a high-temperature environment) with time. Encapsulants using the conventional silicone resin materials are widely used as the encapsulants for optical semiconductor elements. Unfortunately, the encapsulants of this type have lower barrier properties to a corrosive gas. Likewise, the materials described in PTL 1 to 3 disadvantageously have lower barrier properties to a corrosive gas. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a curable resin composition capable of forming a cured product that has excellent heat resistance, transparency, and flexibility and, in particular, offers superior reflow resistance and barrier properties to a corrosive gas. The reflow resistance is exemplified by cracking resistance and package adhesion in a reflow process. It is another object of the present invention to provide a cured product that has excellent heat resistance, transparency, and flexibility and, in particular, offers superior reflow resistance and barrier properties to a corrosive gas. Solution to Problem The present inventors have found a curable resin composition that includes a polyorganosiloxane approximately devoid of aryl groups and further includes a ladder-like polyorganosilsesquioxane, an isocyanurate compound, and a silane coupling agent; and have found that this curable resin composition can form a cured product that has excellent heat resistance, transparency, and flexibility and, in particular, offers superior reflow resistance and barrier properties to a corrosive gas. The present invention has been made based on these findings. Specifically, the present invention provides, in one aspect, a curable resin composition including a polyorganosiloxane (A), a silsesquioxane (B), an isocyanurate compound (C), and a silane coupling agent (D).

The silsesquioxane (B) in the curable resin composition may include a ladder-like silsesquioxane containing an aryl group in molecule.

Advantageous Effects of Invention The curable resin composition according to the present invention has the configuration and can therefore form a cured product that has excellent heat resistance, transparency, and flexibility. In particular, the cured product has excellent reflow resistance, more specifically, typically has excellent cracking resistance and package adhesion in a reflow process, and still offers superior barrier properties to a corrosive gas such as a SOx gas. The curable resin composition according to the present invention is therefore preferably usable as an encapsulating agent for an optical semiconductor element (light-emitting diode). Assume that the curable resin composition according to the present invention is cured to give a cured product that encapsulates the optical semiconductor element to give an optical semiconductor device. In this case, the resulting optical semiconductor device has quality and durability both at superior levels. In particular, the curable resin composition according to the present invention is useful as an encapsulating agent for a next-generation light source that requires such heat resistance as to endure an unprecedented high temperature (e.g., 180°C or higher). Description of Embodiments The curable resin composition according to the present invention includes a polyorganosiloxane (A), a silsesquioxane (B), an isocyanurate compound (C), and a silane coupling agent (D). The polyorganosiloxane (A) is a polyorganosiloxane approximately devoid of aryl groups. The silsesquioxane (B) includes a ladder-like silsesquioxane. Polyorganosiloxane (A) The polyorganosiloxane (A) in the curable resin composition according to the present invention is a polyorganosiloxane that contains a siloxane bond (Si-O-Si) backbone and is approximately devoid of aryl groups. The use of the polyorganosiloxane (A) (polyorganosiloxane approximately devoid of aryl groups) can give a cured product that has excellent heat resistance, flexibility, and cracking resistance. The polyorganosiloxane (A) may include a polyorganosiloxane containing a straight chain or branched chain. Among them, the polyorganosiloxane (A) preferably includes a polyorganosiloxane containing a branched chain, from the viewpoint of strength of the cured product. The polyorganosiloxane (A) may contain silicon atoms each bearing one or more substituents. The substituents are exemplified by hydrogen, groups containing a Si-H bond, aryl-free substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon groups (of which alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, and cycloalkenyl are preferred), hydroxy, alkoxy, alkenyloxy, acyloxy, mercapto (thiol), alkylthio, alkenylthio, carboxy, alkoxycarbonyl, amino or substituted amino (e.g., mono- or di-alkylamino and acylamino), epoxy, and halogen. The alkyl is preferably C1-C10 alkyl, and more preferably C1-C4 alkyl. The alkenyl is preferably C2-C10 alkenyl, and more preferably C2-C4 alkenyl. The cycloalkyl is preferably C3-C12 cycloalkyl. The cycloalkenyl is preferably C3-C12 cycloalkenyl. The alkoxy is preferably C1-C6 alkoxy. The alkenyloxy is preferably C1-C6 alkenyloxy. The acyloxy is preferably C1-C6 acyloxy. The alkylthio is preferably C1-C6 alkylthio. The alkenylthio is preferably C1-C6 alkenylthio. The carboxy is preferably C1-C6 carboxy. The alkoxycarbonyl is preferably (C1-C6 alkoxy)-carbonyl. The polyorganosiloxane (A) particularly preferably includes a polyorganosiloxane containing, as the substituent, at least one substituent selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, groups containing a Si-H bond, and aryl-free substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon groups (of which alkyl or alkenyl is preferred). The polyorganopolysiloxane (A) may have a number-average molecular weight not critical, but preferably from 500 to 20000, more preferably from 1000 to 10000, and furthermore preferably from 2000 to 8000. The polyorganosiloxane (A) may have a weight-average molecular weight not critical, but preferably from 500 to 50000, more preferably from 5000 to 40000, and furthermore preferably from 10000 to 30000. The number-average molecular weight and/or the weight-average molecular weight may be calculated typically as a molecular weight determined by gel permeation chromatography and calibrated with a polystyrene standard. The curable resin composition according to the present invention may include each of different polyorganosiloxanes alone or in combination as the polyorganosiloxane (A). The curable resin composition according to the present invention may contain the polyorganosiloxane (A) in a content (amount) not critical, but preferably from 55 to 95 percent by weight, more preferably from 60 to 92 percent by weight, and furthermore preferably from 65 to 90 percent by weight, based on the total amount (100 percent by weight) of the curable resin composition. The curable resin composition, if containing the polyorganosiloxane (A) in a content less than 55 percent by weight, may cause the cured product to have lower cracking resistance. In contrast, the curable resin composition, if containing the polyorganosiloxane (A) in a content greater than 95 percent by weight, may fail to allow the cured product to have sufficient gas barrier properties to a corrosive gas such as a SOx gas. As the polyorganosiloxane (A), particularly preferred is a polyorganosiloxysilalkylene. The "polyorganosiloxysilalkylene" herein refers to a polyorganosiloxane that contains a -Si-A- group [silalkylene; where A represents alkylene] in addition to - Si-O- group (siloxy group) in the backbone. The alkylene moiety (the moiety A) in the silalkylene of the polyorganosiloxysilalkylene is exemplified by C1-C12 straight or branched chain alkylene, of which C2-C4 straight or branched chain alkylene is preferred, and ethylene is particularly preferred. As compared with a polyorganosiloxane in a narrow sense (polyorganosiloxane having a backbone including -Si-O- groups alone), the polyorganosiloxysilalkylene less forms a low-molecular-weight ring and less decomposes due typically to heating to generate resulting silanol group (-SiOH) upon production process. The polyorganosiloxysilalkylene therefore gives a cured product that tends to less cause surface tack and to less suffer from yellowing. The polyorganosiloxysilalkylene may be produced typically by a method described in JP-A No. 2012-140617. The polyorganosiloxysilalkylene may also be available as products typically under the trade names of GD-1012A and GD-1012B (each from Eternal Chemical Co., Ltd.).

In contrast, the curable resin composition, if containing the silsesquioxane (B) in a content greater than 45 percent by weight, may cause the cured product to have inferior cracking resistance and/or lower heat resistance. Ladder-like Silsesquioxane (B1) The curable resin composition according to the present invention may include a ladder-like silsesquioxane (B1) as the silsesquioxane (B). The "ladder-like silsesquioxane (B1)" refers to a ladder-like silsesquioxane containing an aliphatic carbon-carbon double bond in molecule. The ladder-like silsesquioxane (B1) is not limited, as long as being a compound that contains, in the side chain or at the terminal group, a group containing an aliphatic carbon-carbon double bond.

Among them, alkenyl is preferred, C2-C20 alkenyl is more preferred, and vinyl is furthermore preferred. The ladder-like silsesquioxane (B1) may contain the aliphatic carbon-carbon double bond in a number in molecule (per molecule) not critical, but preferably 2 or more (e.g., from 2 to 50), and more preferably from 2 to 30. The ladder-like silsesquioxane (B1), when containing the aliphatic carbon-carbon double bond in a number within the range, may readily contribute to the formation of a cured product that has excellent heat resistance and other physical properties, cracking resistance, and barrier properties to a corrosive gas. The ladder-like silsesquioxane (B1) may contain the aliphatic carbon-carbon double bond in a content not critical, but preferably from 0.7 to 5.5 mmol/g, and more preferably from 1.1 to 4.4 mmol/g. The ladder-like silsesquioxane (B1) may contain the aliphatic carbon-carbon double bond in a proportion (by weight) not critical, but preferably from 2.0 to 15.0 percent by weight, and more preferably from 3.0 to 12.0 percent by weight, in terms of vinyl.

The ladder-like silsesquioxane (B1), if having a viscosity less than 100 mPa•s, may cause the cured product to have lower heat resistance. In contrast, the ladder-like silsesquioxane (B1), if having a viscosity greater than 100000 mPa•s, may cause the curable resin composition to be prepared and/or to be handled with difficulty. The viscosity at 23°C may be measured typically with a rheometer (trade name Physica UDS-200, supplied by Anton Paar GmbH) and a cone-and-plate (with a cone diameter of 16 mm at a taper angle of 0°) at a temperature of 23°C and a number of revolutions of 20 rpm. Ladder-like Silsesquioxane (B2) The curable resin composition according to the present invention may include a ladder-like silsesquioxane (B2) as the silsesquioxane (B). The "ladder-like silsesquioxane (B2)" refers to a silsesquioxane containing a Si-H bond in molecule. The ladder-like silsesquioxane (B2) is not limited, as long as being a compound containing, in the side chain or at the terminal group, hydrogen and/or a group containing a Si-H bond. The group containing a Si-H bond is exemplified by, but not limited to, the groups represented by Formula (4) in which at least one of three occurrences of R' is hydrogen. The ladder-like silsesquioxane (B2) may contain the hydrogen and/or the group containing a Si-H bond in a number in molecule (per molecule) not critical, but preferably 2 or more (e.g., from 2 to 50), and more preferably from 2 to 30. The ladder-like silsesquioxane (B2), when containing the hydrogen and/or the group containing a Si-H in a number within the range, may contribute to better heat resistance of the cured product derived from the curable resin composition. The ladder-like silsesquioxane (B2) may contain the hydrogen and/or the group containing a Si-H bond in a content not critical, but preferably from 0.01 to 0.50 mmol/g, and more preferably from 0.08 to 0.28 mmol/g. The ladder-like silsesquioxane (B2) may contain the hydrogen and/or the group containing a Si-H bond in a proportion (by weight) not critical, but preferably from 0.01 to 0.50 percent by weight, and more preferably from 0.08 to 0.28 percent by weight in terms of H. The term "in terms of H" refers to "in terms of weight of hydrogen or H (hydrido) in the Si-H bond". The ladder-like silsesquioxane (B2), if containing the hydrogen and/or the group containing a Si-H bond in an excessively low content (e.g., less than 0.01 mmol/g, or less than 0.01 percent by weight in terms of H), may cause the curable resin composition to be cured insufficiently. In contrast, the ladder-like silsesquioxane (B2), if containing the hydrogen and/or the group containing a Si-H bond in an excessively high content (e.g., greater than 0.50 mmol/g, or greater than 0.50 percent by weight in terms of H), may cause the cured product to have excessively high hardness (to be excessively rigid) and to be susceptible to fracture. The content of the hydrogen and/or the group containing a Si-H bond in the ladder-like silsesquioxane (B2) may be measured typically by 1H-NMR. The ladder-like silsesquioxane (B2) may contain the group containing a Si-H bond in a content not critical, but preferably from 50 to 100 mole percent, and more preferably from 80 to 100 mole percent, based on the total amount (100 mole percent) of the hydrogen and/or the group containing a Si-H bond in the ladder-like silsesquioxane (B2). This is preferred from the viewpoint of degree of cure. Though not limited, the ladder-like silsesquioxane (B2) is preferably liquid at room temperature (about 25°C). More specifically, the ladder-like silsesquioxane (B2) may have a viscosity of preferably from 100 to 100000 mPa•s, more preferably from 500 to 10000 mPa•s, and furthermore preferably from 1000 to 8000 mPa•s at 23°C. The ladder-like silsesquioxane (B2), if having a viscosity less than 100 mPa•s, may cause the cured product to have lower heat resistance. In contrast, the ladder-like silsesquioxane (B2), if having a viscosity greater than 100000 mPa•s, may cause the curable resin composition to be prepared and/or to be handled with difficulty. The viscosity at 23°C may be measured typically by a similar procedure to the measurement of the viscosity of the ladder-like silsesquioxane (B1). The curable resin composition according to the present invention may contain the ladder-like silsesquioxane (B1) and the ladder-like silsesquioxane (B2) in a proportion (in a total amount) not critical, but preferably 60 percent by weight or more (e.g., 60 to 100 percent by weight), more preferably 80 percent by weight or more, and furthermore preferably 90 percent by weight or more, based on the total amount (100 percent by weight) of the silsesquioxane (B). The curable resin composition, if containing the ladder-like silsesquioxane (B1) and the ladder-like silsesquioxane (B2) in a total proportion less than 60 percent by weight, may readily cause the cured product to have lower barrier properties to a corrosive gas. Other Ladder-like Silsesquioxanes The curable resin composition according to the present invention may also include, as the ladder-like silsesquioxane, one or more other ladder-like silsesquioxanes. The term "other ladder-like silsesquioxane(s)" refers to ladder-like silsesquioxane(s) other than the ladder-like silsesquioxane (B1) and the ladder-like silsesquioxane (B2). In particular, the curable resin composition may preferably include the other ladder-like silsesquioxane(s) in combination with the ladder-like silsesquioxane (B1) and/or the ladder-like silsesquioxane (B2). In particular, preferred examples of the other ladder-like silsesquioxanes include a ladder-like silsesquioxane (S1) and a ladder-like silsesquioxane (S2). The "ladder-like silsesquioxane (S1)" refers to a ladder-like silsesquioxane that is solid at 25°C and contains an aliphatic carbon-carbon double bond. The "ladder-like silsesquioxane (S2)" refers to a ladder-like silsesquioxane that is solid at 25°C and contains a hydrosilyl group. In an embodiment, the curable resin composition according to the present invention includes the ladder-like silsesquioxane (S1) and/or (S2). In particular in this embodiment, the curable resin composition may give, upon curing, a cured product that has better barrier properties to a corrosive gas and better toughness (in particular, cracking resistance).

In Formula (1), Rx, Ry, and Rz are each, identically or differently, selected from the group represented by Formula (2) and the group represented by Formula (3). In particular, at least one (preferably one or two, more preferably one) of Rx, Ry, and Rz in Formula (1) is preferably the group represented by Formula (3). In Formulae (2) and (3), R1 and R2 are each, identically or differently, selected from hydrogen and C1-C8 straight or branched chain alkyl. The C1-C8 straight or branched chain alkyl is exemplified by methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, s-butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, and ethylhexyl. Of the alkyl, preferred is C1-C3 straight or branched chain alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, and isopropyl. R1 and R2 in Formulae (2) and (3) are each particularly preferably hydrogen.

The curable resin composition may include each of different isocyanurate compounds alone or in combination as the isocyanurate compound (C). The isocyanurate compound (C) may be mixed with the silane coupling agent (D) before being mixed with other components as described later. This is performed for better compatibility with the other components. The curable resin composition may contain the isocyanurate compound (C) in a content not critical, but preferably from 0.01 to 10 percent by weight, more preferably from 0.05 to 5 percent by weight, and furthermore preferably from 0.1 to 3 percent by weight, based on the total amount (100 percent by weight) of the curable resin composition. The curable resin composition, if containing the isocyanurate compound (C) in a content less than 0.01 percent by weight, may cause the cured product to have lower barrier properties to a corrosive gas and lower adhesion to an adherend. In contrast, the curable resin composition, if containing the isocyanurate compound (C) in a content greater than 10 percent by weight, may suffer from precipitation of solids or may cause the cured product to be cloudy. Silane Coupling Agent (D) The curable resin composition according to the present invention includes a silane coupling agent (D). The curable resin composition according to the present invention, as including the silane coupling agent (D), may readily give, upon curing, a cured product that has better barrier properties to a corrosive gas and, in particular, better adhesion to an adherend. The silane coupling agent (D) has good compatibility with components such as the silsesquioxane (B) and the isocyanurate compound (C). Typically, for better compatibility of the isocyanurate compound (C) with other components, the isocyanurate compound (C) may be blended beforehand with the silane coupling agent (D) to give a composition, and the composition may be blended with the other components. This may readily give a homogeneous curable resin composition. The silane coupling agent (D) may be selected from known or common silane coupling agents without limitation, but is exemplified by epoxy-containing silane coupling agents such as 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, 2-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl)ethyltrimethoxysilane, 3-glycidoxypropylmethyldiethoxysilane, and 3-glycidoxypropyltriethoxysilane; amino-containing silane coupling agents such as N-2-(aminoethyl)-3-aminopropylmethyldimethoxysilane, N-2-(aminoethyl)-3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, N-2-(aminoethyl)-3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, 3-triethoxysilyl-N-(1,3-dimethyl-butylidene)propylamine, N-phenyl-3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, N-(vinylbenzyl)-2-aminoethyl-3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane hydrochloride, and N-(β-aminoethyl)-γ-aminopropylmethyldiethoxysilane; and other silane coupling agents such as tetramethoxysilane, tetraethoxysilane, methyltriethoxysilane, dimethyldiethoxysilane, methyltriethoxysilane, vinyltriethoxysilane, vinyltrimethoxysilane, vinyltris(methoxyethoxysilane), phenyltrimethoxysilane, diphenyldimethoxysilane, vinyltriacetoxysilane, γ-(meth)acryloxypropyltriethoxysilane, γ-(meth)acryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, γ-(meth)acryloxypropylmethyldimethoxysilane, γ-(meth)acryloxypropylmethyldiethoxysilane, mercaptopropylenetrimethoxysilane, and mercaptopropylenetriethoxysilane. Among them, epoxy-containing silane coupling agents are preferred, of which 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane is particularly preferred. The curable resin composition may include each of different silane coupling agents alone or in combination as the silane coupling agent (D). The curable resin composition may contain the silane coupling agent (D) in a content not critical, but preferably from 0.01 to 15 percent by weight, more preferably from 0.1 to 10 percent by weight, and furthermore preferably from 0.5 to 5 percent by weight, based on the total amount (100 percent by weight) of the curable resin composition. The curable resin composition, if containing the silane coupling agent (D) in a content less than 0.01 percent by weight, may cause the cured product to have lower adhesion to an adherend. In particular, when the silane coupling agent (D) is mixed beforehand with the isocyanurate compound (C), this curable resin composition may fail to allow the cured product to have sufficient effects (barrier properties to a corrosive gas). In contrast, the curable resin composition, if containing the silane coupling agent (D) in a content greater than 15 percent by weight, may undergo lower curing to cause the cured product to have lower toughness, heat resistance, and barrier properties. Hydrosilylation Catalyst The curable resin composition according to the present invention may further include a hydrosilylation catalyst.

Other Silane Compounds The curable resin composition according to the present invention may include another silane compound such as a hydrosilyl-containing compound. The other silane compound is exemplified by Si-H-containing straight or branched chain siloxanes such as methyl(trisdimethylsiloxy)silane, tetrakis(dimethylsiloxy)silane, 1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane, 1,1,3,3,5,5-hexamethyltrisiloxane, 1,1,1,3,5,5,5-heptamethyltrisiloxane, 1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7-octamethyltetrasiloxane, 1,1,1,3,5,5,7,7,7-nonamethyltetrasiloxane, 1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7,9,9-decamethylpentasiloxane, and 1,1,1,3,5,5,7,7,9,9,9-undecamethylpentasiloxane.

Control of the proportions of the hydrosilyl group and the aliphatic carbon-carbon double bond within the range may readily allow the cured product to have still better heat resistance, transparency, flexibility, reflow resistance, and barrier properties to a corrosive gas. The curable resin composition according to the present invention may be prepared typically, but not limitatively, by stirring and mixing the components at room temperature. The curable resin composition according to the present invention can be used as a one-part composition or a multi-part (e.g., two-part) composition. The one-part composition is prepared by mixing the individual components in advance and is used as intact. The multi-part composition is prepared as two or more components stored separately and is used after mixing them in predetermined proportions.

In contrast, the curable resin composition, if having a viscosity greater than 20000 mPa•s, may be prepared and/or handled with difficulty and may cause air bubbles to readily remain in the cured product. The viscosity of the curable resin composition may be measured by a procedure similar to the measurement of the viscosity of the ladder-like silsesquioxane (B1).
