GH improves spatial memory and reverses certain anabolic androgenic steroid-induced effects in intact rats.
GH has previously been shown to promote cognitive functions in GH-deficient rodents.
In this study we report the effects of GH on learning and memory in intact rats pretreated with the anabolic androgenic steroid nandrolone.
Male Wistar rats received nandrolone decanoate (15 mg/kg) or peanut oil every third day for 3 weeks and were subsequently treated with recombinant human GH (1.0 IU/kg) or saline for 10 consecutive days.
During the GH/saline treatment spatial learning and memory were tested in the Morris water maze (MWM).
Also, plasma levels of IGF1 were assessed and the gene expression of the GH receptors (Ghr), Igf1 and Igf2, in hippocampus and frontal cortex was analyzed.
The results demonstrated a significant positive effect of GH on memory functions and increased gene expression of Igf1 in the hippocampus was found in the animals treated with GH.
In addition, GH was demonstrated to increase the body weight gain and was able to attenuate the reduced body weight seen in nandrolone-treated animals.
In general, the rats treated with nandrolone alone did not exhibit any pronounced alteration in memory compared with controls in the MWM, and in many cases GH did not induce any alteration.
Regarding target zone crossings, considered to be associated with spatial memory, the difference between GH- and steroid-treated animals was significant and administration of GH improved this parameter in the latter group.
In conclusion, GH improves spatial memory in intact rats and can reverse certain effects induced by anabolic androgenic steroid.
