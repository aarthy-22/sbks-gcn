INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE All publications, patents, and patent applications mentioned in this specification are herein incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication, patent, or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION While selected embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described herein, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that such embodiments are provided by way of example only. Numerous variations, changes, and substitutions will now occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the invention. It should be understood that various alternatives to the embodiments of the invention described herein may be employed in practicing the invention. It is intended that the appended claims define the scope of the invention and that methods and structures within the scope of these claims and their equivalents be covered thereby. DEFINITIONS Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of skill in the art to which this invention belongs. As used in the specification and claims, the singular form “a”, “an” and “the” includes plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to those salts which are suitable for pharmaceutical use, preferably for use in the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue irritation, allergic response and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of amines, carboxylic acids, and other types of compounds, are well known in the art. For example, S. M. Berge, et al., describe pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in J Pharmaceutical Sciences, 66: 1-19 (1977), incorporated herein by reference. The salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds of the invention, or separately by reacting a free base or free acid function with a suitable reagent, as described generally below. For example, a free base function can be reacted with a suitable acid. Furthermore, where the compounds of the invention carry an acidic moiety, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may, include metal salts such as alkali metal salts, e. g. sodium or potassium salts; and alkaline earth metal salts, e. g. calcium or magnesium salts. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic acid addition salts are salts of an amino group formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and perchloric acid or with organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid or malonic acid or by using other methods used in the art such as ion exchange. Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts include adipate, alginate, ascorbate, aspartate, benzoate, bisulfate, borate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, citrate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, formate, fumarate, glucoheptonate, glycerophosphate, gluconate, hernisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxy-ethanesulfonate, lactobionate, lactate, laurate, lauryl sulfate, malate, maleate, malonate, methanesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, oleate, oxalate, palmitate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, stearate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate, p-toluenesulfonate, undecanoate, valerate salts, and the like. Representative alkali or alkaline earth metal salts include sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and the like. Further pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, when appropriate, nontoxic ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and amine cations formed by direct reaction with the drug carboxylic acid or by using counterions such as halide, hydroxide, carboxylate, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, sulfonate and aryl sulfonate. “Pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” or “pharmaceutically acceptable excipient” includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic compositions of the invention is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions. “Prodrug” is meant to indicate a compound that may be converted under physiological conditions or by solvolysis to a biologically active compound described herein. Thus, the term “prodrug” refers to a precursor of a biologically active compound that is pharmaceutically acceptable. A prodrug may be inactive when administered to a subject, i.e. an ester, but is converted in vivo to an active compound, for example, by hydrolysis to the free carboxylic acid. The prodrug compound often offers advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility or delayed release in a mammalian organism (see, e.g., Bundgard, H., Design of Prodrugs (1985), pp. 7-9, 21-24 (Elsevier, Amsterdam). A discussion of prodrugs is provided in Higuchi, T., et al., “Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems,” A.C.S. Symposium Series, Vol. 14, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are incorporated in full by reference herein. The term “prodrug” is also meant to include any covalently bonded carriers, which release the active compound in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a mammalian subject. Prodrugs of an active compound, as described herein, may be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the active compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent active compound. Prodrugs include compounds wherein a hydroxy, amino or mercapto group is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug of the active compound is administered to a mammalian subject, cleaves to form a free hydroxy, free amino or free mercapto group, respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate and benzoate derivatives of an alcohol or acetamide, formamide and benzamide derivatives of an amine functional group in the active compound and the like. “Subject” refers to an animal, such as a mammal, for example a human. The methods described herein can be useful in both human therapeutics and veterinary applications. In some embodiments, the patient is a mammal, and in some embodiments, the patient is human. In various embodiments, the patient is a non-human animal, such as a dog, cat, rabbit, mouse, rat, cow, horse, pig, or chicken. Unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include compounds which differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For example, compounds having structures wherein a hydrogen is replaced by by a deuterium or tritium, or a carbon is replaced by 13C- or 14C-enriched carbon are within the scope of this invention. The compounds of the present invention may also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the compounds may be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (3H), iodine-125 (125I) or carbon-14 (14C). All isotopic variations of the compounds of the present invention, whether radioactive or not, are encompassed within the scope of the present invention. When ranges are used herein for physical properties, such as molecular weight, or chemical properties, such as chemical formulae, all combinations and subcombinations of ranges and specific embodiments therein are intended to be included. The term “about” when referring to a number or a numerical range means that the number or numerical range referred to is an approximation within experimental variability (or within statistical experimental error), and thus the number or numerical range may vary from, for example, between 1% and 15% of the stated number or numerical range. The term “comprising” (and related terms such as “comprise” or “comprises” or “having” or “including”) includes those embodiments, for example, an embodiment of any composition of matter, composition, method, or process, or the like, that “consist of” or “consist essentially of” the described features. Abbreviations used herein have their conventional meaning within the chemical and biological arts. Compound of Formula I The compound of Formula I: has been found to be an effective inhibitor of LFA-1 interactions with ICAM-1. It is a member of a class of directly competitive inhibitors of LFA-1, binding to ICAM's binding site on LFA-1 directly, and thus excludes ICAM binding. Directly competitive inhibitors of LFA-1 may offer the potential for more effective modulation of the inflammatory and/or immunologic response than allosteric inhibitors provide because these inhibitors occlude the binding site more effectively. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of Formula I are also included. Additional information regarding the compound of Formula I can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 8,080,562; US Patent Publication 2009/0298869; US Patent Publication 2011/0092707; U.S. Pat. No. 8,084,047; US 2010/0092542; and US Patent Publication 2006/0281739; the entire contents of each of which are incorporated by reference. In order to develop clinically useful therapeutics, drug candidates need to be chemically pure enough to administer to a subject and of an acceptable physical form in order to be formulated in pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms. One advantageous route to obtain higher purity, reproducibility of physical form, and stability is to identify one or more useful crystalline forms. The capacity to exist in different crystalline forms is known as polymorphism and is known to occur in many organic molecules. These different crystalline forms are known as “polymorphic modifications” or “polymorphs.” While polymorphic modifications have the same chemical composition, they differ in packing, geometric arrangement, and other descriptive properties of the crystalline solid state. As such, these modifications may have different solid-state physical properties to affect, for example, the solubility, dissolution rate, bioavailability, chemical and physical stability, flowability, fractability, and compressibility of the compound as well as the safety and efficacy of drug products based on the compound. In the process of preparing a polymorph, further purification, in terms of gross physical purity or optical purity, may be accomplished as well. A number of different forms, including crystalline forms, of the compound of Formula I have been discovered, including the crystalline forms A-E and the amorphous form. While crystallization is often performed on organic compounds, it is not predictable in advance as to which conditions will provide suitable conditions to lead to formation of a particular crystalline form. Further, it is not predictable as to which particular crystalline form will provide the necessary mixture of physical properties, nonlimiting examples of which are described above, to yield a desirable drug dosage form, once formulated. Additional information regarding the crystalline forms A-E and the amorphous form of the compound of Formula I can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 8,080,562; US Patent Publication 2009/0298869; US Patent Publication 2011/0092707; U.S. Pat. No. 8,084,047; US 2010/0092542; and US Patent Publication 2006/0281739; the entire contents of each of which are incorporated by reference. Methods of Manufacture of the Compound of Formula I In one embodiment, the compound of Formula I is synthesized as in the following Schemes 1-7. The final product of this synthesis yields the compound of Formula I as an amorphous solid or as a crystalline form such as Forms A-E, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, either directly or indirectly. Variants of this overall route may provide superior yields, cost of goods, and/or superior chiral purity. Protecting groups for amino and carboxy groups are known in the art. For example, see Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Wiley Interscience, 1981, and subsequent editions. In various embodiments in the subsequent schemes, HATU is used as a reagent in amide-bond forming reactions. Alternatively, HATU is not used. In various embodiments, at least one amide-bond forming reaction is performed with thionyl chloride as a reagent in place of HATU. In various embodiments, all amide-bond forming reactions are performed with thionyl chloride as a reagent to form acid chlorides. A first alternative protecting strategy produces compound 5′, a protected species as shown in Scheme 1. The synthesis begins by reductively aminating 3,5, dichlorobenzaldehyde, compound 1′. Cyclization of compound 2′ provides compound 3′. Protection of the free amine of compound 3′ as a protected species provides compound 4′. A carboxylic acid functionality is introduced by treatment of compound 4′ with introduction of carbon dioxide, to produce compound 5′. In various embodiments, the protecting group of compound 4′ is a benzofuranyl carbonyl moiety derived from compound 18′. In various embodiments, upon scaleup to multikilogram and larger scale reactions, treatment of compound 4′ with strong base (such as n-butyllithium (nBuLi) to generate a lithio species, or lithium diisopropyl amide (LDA) to generate the lithio species) is performed in flow mode rather than batchwise reaction due to instability of lithio species except at cold temperatures. Flow rates and residence times may be adjusted to maximize yield. In various embodiments, 6-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-isoquinoline (Compound 3″) is used as a starting material for Compound 5′. The starting material is chlorinated (×2) for example, with N-chlorosuccinimide. In various embodiments, the chlorination is performed in the presence of a sulfonic acid. In various embodiments, the sulfonic acid is selected from p-toluenesulfonic acid and methanesulfonic acid. Following protection of the amino group, the hydroxy group is functionalized, for example, as the triflate ester, which is carbonylated to yield the amino-protected methyl ester. Hydrolysis of the methyl ester yields the amino protected carboxylic acid. In various embodiments, bromophenylalanine is used as the starting material for a portion of the final molecule as shown in Scheme 2. The starting material is protected with an amino protecting group to allow for introduction of a methyl sulfone functionality in compound 8′. Protecting groups are rearranged by introduction of an orthogonal protecting group for the carboxylic moiety, followed by deprotection of the amino group to provide compound 10′. In various embodiments, expensive or exotic bases are replaced with carbonate base such as potassium carbonate or calcium carbonate as a reagent. In various embodiments, 3-methylsulfonylbenzaldehyde is converted into the 3-methylsulfonylphenylalanine derivative and functionalized to yield compound 10 as shown above. Compounds 5′ and 10′ are joined through amide bond formation followed by deprotection of the remaining amino group in the presence of the carboxylic protecting group to yield compound 12′ or a salt thereof, such as the HCL salt. As an alternative to Scheme 3, compound 10″ is coupled with compound 5′ to yield the bromo compound 12″, with subsequent introduction of a methyl sulfone functionality in place of bromine at a later step to produce compound 19′. Alternatively, instead of a bromine, compound 10″ includes X, where X is any halide (Cl, I, Br, F) or a leaving group such as OTs, OTf, or the like. The benzofuranyl carbonyl moiety of the compound of Formula I can be prepared using various alternative schemes. In one embodiment, the benzofuranyl carbonyl moiety is prepared by protecting the hydroxyl group of compound 13′, reducing the carbonyl of compound 13′ to yield the benzofuranyl moiety, followed by carboxylation to yield compound 18′. Scheme 4A In one embodiment, compound 18′ is prepared from 6-hydroxybenzofuran via the triflate ester and the 6-carboxy methyl ester as intermediates, as shown in Example 4A. The benzofuran carboxylic acid 18′ is coupled with compound 12′ (or a salt thereof) by amide bond formation to yield protected compound 19′, as shown in Scheme 5. Amide bond formation is known in the art As an alternative to Schemes 3-5, compounds 18′ and 5″ may be coupled through amide bond formation followed by deprotection of the remaining carboxylic group to form compound 12″. Amide bond formation between compound 12″ and 10′ yields compound 19′ with a protected carboxylic group. As an alternative to Schemes 1-5, compounds 12″ and 10″ may be coupled through amide bond formation followed by introduction of a methyl sulfone functionality in place of the bromine in converting compound 19″ to compound 19′ (similar to Scheme 2). Alternatively, instead of a bromine, compound 10″ includes X, where X is any halide (Cl, I, Br, F) or a leaving group such as OTs, OTf, or the like. Compound 12″ can also be made using the following scheme: Final deprotection of compound 19′ to yield the compound of Formula I or a salt thereof is accomplished in a variety of ways. In various embodiments, the resulting compound of Formula I is provided in higher optical purity and/or higher overall purity and/or higher overall yield. In one approach, an ester protecting group is removed with acid catalyzed hydrolysis. For example, a methyl ester protecting group is removed with acid catalyzed hydrolysis. Alternatively, a benzyl ester protecting group is removed with acid, for example HCl in dioxane. The solvent for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis may be any industrially available solvent such as an aprotic solvent, a protic solvent, a polar solvent, a non-polar solvent, an ionic solvent, or a pressurized gas such as supercritical carbon dioxide. In various embodiments, the solvent is an aprotic solvent such as dioxane or tetrahydrofuran or acetone. Variously, the solvent may be selected from hexane, benzene, toluene, 1,4-dioxane, chloroform, diethyl ether, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, acetone, dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide, n-butanol, isopropanol, n-propanol, ethanol, methanol, water, formic acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, and combinations thereof, such as aqueous acetone. The acid may be any acid used for hydrolysis reactions. In various embodiments, the acid is a mineral acid. In various embodiments, the acid is selected from hydrogen chloride, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, and sulfonic acids. In various embodiments, the acid is trifluoroacetic acid. In one embodiment, the ester may be removed by nucleophilic displacement, such as using sodium iodide in dimethylsulfoxide. In one approach, a benzyl ester protecting group is removed with palladium on carbon. For example, the benzyl ester of compound 19′ is removed by transfer hydrogenolysis using 10% palladium on carbon, using formic acid and triethylamine in a 5:1 mixture of methanol:THF, to produce the compound of Formula I. In various embodiments, the compound 19′ is a compound of Formula AA. A general strategy to convert a compound of Formula AA is provided by base hydrolysis of the ester to yield the compound of Formula I. The compound of Formula AA may be reacted with a base in a solvent to accomplish the base-catalyzed saponification of Formula AA to yield the compound of Formula I. The saponification solvent may be any industrially available solvent such as an aprotic solvent, a protic solvent, a polar solvent, a non-polar solvent, an ionic solvent, or a pressurized gas such as supercritical carbon dioxide. In various embodiments, the solvent is an aprotic solvent such as dioxane or tetrahydrofuran or acetone. Variously, the solvent may be selected from hexane, benzene, toluene, 1,4-dioxane, chloroform, diethyl ether, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, acetone, dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide, n-butanol, isopropanol, n-propanol, ethanol, methanol, water, and combinations thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the solvent is aqueous acetone. The base may be any base used for saponification reactions. In various embodiments, the base is a hydroxide such as potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide or lithium hydroxide. In various embodiments, the R group is any carbon containing moiety. Such compounds may be useful as synthetic intermediates of compounds of Formula I, or as prodrugs of Formula I. Within the group where R is any carbon containing moiety, R may be selected from lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl, cyclo(lower)alkyl, cyclo(lower)alkenyl, aryl, aralkyl, heterocyclyl, and heteroaryl, any of which can be substituted or unsubstituted. In various embodiments, the lower alkyl group is methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, pentyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, or hexyl. In various embodiments, the R group of Formula AA is a benzyl group. In various embodiments of Formula AA, the carbon-containing moiety R does not include a benzyl group. In various embodiments the R group is a silyl-containing moiety such that Formula AA is a silyl ester. In one embodiment, an ester protecting group is removed with base catalyzed hydrolysis in a homogeneous reaction such as a reaction in solution. For example, a benzyl ester protecting group is removed with NaOH in aqueous dioxane. In one embodiment, a benzyl ester protecting group is removed with NaOH in aqueous acetone. In various embodiments of a homogeneous liquid reaction, NaOH may range from about 0.1N to about 2N, such as about 0.5 N, 0.6 N, 0.7 N, 0.8 N, 0.9 N, 1.0 N, 1.1 N, 1.2 N, 1.3 N, 1.4 N, or 1.5 N, with all listed concentrations understood to be “about”. In one embodiment, an ester protecting group is removed from Compound 19′ or Formula AA with base catalyzed hydrolysis in a heterogeneous reaction in the presence of phase transfer catalyst. For example, Compound 19′ or a compound of Formula AA is contacted with phase transfer catalyst in aqueous acetone. In various embodiments, the reaction occurs in the presence of a solid-liquid interface. In various embodiments, the reaction occurs in a slurry of solvent and crystalline material. In various embodiments, the reaction is biphasic. In various embodiments, the reaction begins as a biphasic batch reaction and becomes increasingly homogeneous as the reaction proceeds and starting material is converted to product which remains in solution. In various embodiments, racemization of starting material is minimized by reducing exposure of unreacted starting material to base through the use of biphasic conditions. In various embodiments, the progress of the reaction is monitored by assessing the level of solid material remaining. In various embodiments, the reaction is deemed to be essentially complete when the reaction mixture is essentially monophasic (i.e. all solids have been dissolved into solution). In various embodiments, base hydrolysis is performed with an amount of base ranging from about 0.9 equivalents to about 3 equivalents, such as about 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, or 3.0 equivalents, all amounts being about. In various embodiments, the amount of base ranges from about 1.0 to about 1.5 equivalents, such as about 1.2 equivalents. In various embodiments, the base is NaOH. In various embodiments, base hydrolysis is performed with NaOH as base in the presence of less than a stoichiometric amount of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide. In various embodiments, the reaction is a batch reaction with a time to completion of greater than 0 hours and less than about 24 hours, less than about 12 hours, less than about 8 hours, less than about 6 hours, or less than about 4 hours. In various embodiments, base catalyzed hydrolysis of compound 19′ or the compound of Formula AA is performed in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst. In various embodiments, the phase transfer catalyst is a quaternary ammonium salt, a phosphonium salt, or a crown ether. In various embodiments, the phase transfer catalyst is selected from benzyltrimethylammonium chloride, hexadecyltributylphosphonium bromide, tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, tetrabutylammonium bromide, methyltrioctylammonium chloride, and tetrabutylammonium chloride. In various embodiments, the phase transfer catalyst is tetrabutylammonium hydroxide. In one embodiment, the amount of phase transfer catalyst is less than a stoichiometric amount. For example, the amount of phase transfer catalyst is about 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, or 0.9 equivalents, all amounts being about. In further embodiments, the ester protecting group can be removed by other procedures known in the literature including slightly acidic and slightly basic conditions. The ester protecting groups can also be removed by treatment with ester hydrolyzing enzymes like pig liver esterase, cholesterol esterase, amino esterase, etc. The removal of the ester protecting group from Formula AA can further be achieved by application of strong acid resins, weak acid resins, strong base resins, or weak base resins. Upon formation of the compound of Formula I as a crude compound, a variety of isolation and/or purification methods are available. The compound of Formula I may be isolated as a crude product through distillation or evaporation of solvent from the final deprotection step. Removal of solvent may be through removal to dryness, or through removal of a portion of solvent to yield a solid/liquid mixture which is filtered and/or washed. Crude compound may be purified by slurrying in a solvent such as methyl ethylketone (MEK), acetonitrile, methylene chloride, or acetone, which solvents may be aqueous or nonaqueous. The compound for Formula I may be isolated/purified through recrystallization and/or washing with additional solvents. Procedures for recrystallization in small and large scales are known in the art. A partial list of useful solvents for the preparation and purification of the compound of Formula I includes, for example, water, aliphatic solvents such as pentane, petroleum ether, and hexane; aromatic solvents such as toluene and xylene, aliphatic ketones and esters such as methyl ethyl ketone, acetone, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, and butyl acetate, alcohols, such as ethyl alcohol, propyl alcohol, and methyl alcohol, acetonitrile, ethers, such as ethyl ether, tert-butyl methyl ether (TBME), and tetrahydrofuran, alkenes and alkynes, alkenyl esters and alcohols, alkynyl esters and alcohols, and aromatic esters and alcohols. In one embodiment, recrystallization is performed in pharmaceutically acceptable solvent(s). In one embodiment, a useful solvent is aqueous acetone. In various embodiments, recrystallization is performed with from about 0.5 volumes to about 15 volumes of recrystallization solvent, for example from about 5 volumes to about 15 volumes, or for example about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 volumes. In various embodiments, recrystallization is performed with at least about 10 volumes of recrystallization solvent. In various embodiments, recrystallization provides one or more crops of crystals, for example 1 crop, 2 crops, 3 crops, or more. In various embodiments, recrystallization provides a yield of at least 50%, or at least 60%, or at least 70%, or at least 80%, or at least 90% in a first filtration and/or in a combination of filtrations. In various embodiments, final deprotection and/or recrystallization is performed in aqueous acetone. Water and acetone are miscible thus allowing for a range from 100%/0% water/acetone to 0%/100% water acetone. In various embodiments, the ratio of water/acetone is about 10/90, 20/80, 30/70, 40/60, 50/50, 60/40, 70/30, 80/20, or 90/10, all amounts being “about”. Preferably, the solvent for final deprotection and/or recrystallization is about 30% aqueous acetone. In various embodiments, recrystallization with aqueous aceone provides a yield of at least 50%, or at least 60%, or at least 70%, or at least 80%, or at least 90% in the first filtration and/or in a combination of filtrations. In various embodiments, aqueous acetone is used from about 0.5 volumes to about 15 volumes, such as about 7 volumes, as provided above.

EXAMPLES Example 1 Reductively aminating 3,5-dichlorobenzaldehyde, compound 1, with 1-chloro-2-aminoethane and sodium cyanoborohydride provided 35% yield of compound 2. Cyclization of compound 2 using aluminum chloride catalysis and ammoniun chloride at 185° C. provided compound 3 in 91% yield. Protection of the free amine of compound 3 as the trityl protected species afforded compound 4 in 89% yield. A carboxylic acid functionality was introduced by treatment of compound 4 with n-butyllithium (nBuLi) and tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA), with subsequent introduction of carbon dioxide, to produce trityl protected compound 5 in 75% yield. Example 1A To a glass reactor was charged 3,5-dichlorobenzaldehyde. Absolute ethanol was added to the batch slowly (this addition is mildly exothermic) and agitation started. 2,2-Diethoxyethylamine (1.03 equiv) was slowly added to the batch, keeping the batch temperature at 20-78° C. The batch was then heated to 76-78° C. for 2 h. GC-MS analysis indicated reaction completion (starting material <1%). The batch was cooled to ambient temperature for work-up. The batch was concentrated in vacuo to a residue and azeotroped with heptanes (×2). The residue was cooled and held at 0-5° C. for 12 h to form a suspension. The solids were collected by filtration and the cake was washed with cold (0-5° C.) heptanes, and dried under hot nitrogen (45-50° C.) to afford Compound 2′ as a white solid (94% yield). To a glass reactor was charged concentrated 95-98% sulfuric acid (25.9 equiv). The batch was heated to 120-125° C. and a solution of Compound 2′ in CH2Cl2 was added slowly over 1 h, keeping the batch temperature between 120-125° C. The batch was then stirred at 120-125° C. for 6 h. The batch was cooled to <50° C. To a glass reactor was charged DI water and the batch temperature was adjusted to 0-5° C. The reaction mixture was slowly transferred, keeping the batch temperature between 0-50° C. DI water was used to aid the transfer. To the batch was added Dicalite 4200. The batch was filtered through a pad of Dicalite 4200. To the filtrate was added 50% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution slowly over 3 h, keeping the batch temperature between 0-50° C. to adjust the pH to 12. The resulting suspension was stirred at 45-50° C. for 2 h and the solids were collected by filtration. The filter cake was slurried in DI water at 30-35° C. for 1 h. The batch was filtered. The cake was washed with heptanes and dried in vacuum oven at 45-50° C. for 22 h to give crude compound 2″ as a tan solid (75% yield), which was further purified by recrystallization. To a reactor was added platinum dioxide (0.012 equiv), Compound 2″, and MeOH (10 vol) and the suspension was stirred at room temperature under argon for 10 minutes. The reaction mixture was inerted with argon three times and then stirred under 125 psi of hydrogen at room temperature for 25 hours. HPLC analysis indicated complete reaction with less than 1% of the starting material remaining After standing, the supernatant was decanted from the solids (catalyst) by vacuum. To the solids was added methanol and the slurry was mixed under nitrogen. The solids were allowed to settle on the bottom over several hours. The supernatant was decanted from the solids by vacuum. The combined supernatants were filtered through Celite under a blanket of nitrogen and the filter pad was washed with MeOH (×2). The combined filtrate and washes were concentrated to dryness. The residue was slurried in MTBE. The mixture was treated with 3 M HCl while maintaining the temperature <40° C. resulting in the formation of a heavy precipitate. The mixture was stirred at 35-40° C. for 60 to 90 minutes. The batch was cooled to 0-5° C., stirred for 60 to 90 minutes and then filtered. The filter cake was washed with cold DI water (×2) followed by a displacement wash with MTBE (×2). The filter cake was dried under reduced pressure to afford Compound 3 Hydrochloride Salt (86% yield). The hydrogenation catalyst can be recovered and re-used. Compound 3 and trityl chloride were added to the reaction flask. DCM (10 vol) was added to the reactor and agitation was started to form slurry. The reaction mixture was cooled to 10-15° C. N,N-Diisopropylethylamine (2.5 equiv) was slowly added to the reaction mixture, maintaining the temperature at 15-25° C. during the addition. Once addition was complete, the batch was stirred at 15 to 25° C. for a minimum of 60 minutes. The reaction was assayed by HPLC by diluting a sample with acetonitrile and then injecting it on the HPLC. The first assay after 30 minutes indicated that the reaction was complete with <1% of starting material observed by HPLC analysis. The reaction mixture was diluted with DI water (5 vol). The reaction mixture was stirred for 5 minutes after which it was transferred into a separation funnel and the phases were allowed to separate. The DCM layer was washed with DI water (5 vol) by stirring for 5 minutes and then allowing the phases to separate. The DCM layer was washed with brine (5 vol) by stirring for 5 minutes and then allowing the phases to separate. The DCM layer was dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and the filter cake was washed with DCM (×2). The combined filtrate and washes were concentrated to a residue that was azeotroped with EtOAc (×2). The residue was suspended in EtOAc and stirred for 1 hour in a 40° C. water bath. The resulting slurry was cooled to 0-5° C. for 1 hour and then filtered. The filter cake was washed twice with EtOAc and then dried under reduced pressure to afford Compound 4. Example 1B To 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6-hydroxy-isoqinoline in acetonitrile was added p-toluenesulfonic acid and N-chlorosuccinimide. The suspension was cooled to ambient temperature, and the product isolated by filtration for a yield of approximately 61% with purity greater than 95%. The isolated TsOH salt was recrystallized until purity was greater than 99.7%. To one equivalent of the TsOH salt suspended in methanol was added 2M sodium carbonate (0.55 eq.) and 1.2 eq. of Boc anhydride. The suspension was stirred at room temperature overnight. The reaction was monitored by HPLC. Upon completion, the mixture was cooled to below 10° C., water was added, and the Boc-protected dichloro compound was isolated by filtraton. The product was washed and dried at 40° C. for a yield of 95% and purity of >97%. The Boc-protected dichloro compound was suspended in dichloromethane (10 volumes) and pyridine (5 volumes) was added. The mixture was cooled to below 2° C., and triflic anhydride (1.25 eq) was added. The mixture was stirred at 0-2° C. for 10 minutes, and then poured into 10 volumes of 6% aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution. After washing with dichloromethane, the organic phases were combined and dried over magnesium sulphate. Following purification, the product (Compound 4′) was obtained in 90% yield and >98% purity. Compound 4′ was dissolved in dimethylformamide and methanol at room temperature. Diisopropylamine (4 eq) was added. Under CO atmosphere, 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane (0.1 eq) and palladium acetate (0.1 eq) was added. The reaction was heated to reflux, and monitored by HPLC.

Quenched reaction mixture was filtered, extracted with dichloromethane ×3, washed with ammonium chloride solution, washed with sodium bisulphite solution, and washed with brine. Crude product in dichloromethane was concentrated in vacuo until moisture content was below about 0.5%, and used in next step without further isolation. Crude compound 8 in dichloromethane was charged with benzyl alcohol and DMPA with stirring under nitrogen. Reaction cooled to 0-5° C. EDC-HCL (1.03 equiv) added with stirring for 30 minutes. Upon completion of reaction by TLC and HPLC, the reaction was quenched with sodium bicarbonate solution, the organic layer was separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted with dichloromethane. The organic layer was washed with citric acid solution, and combined organic layers were washed with brine solution. Dichloromethane was removed at 45-50° C., and the concentrate was used for next step without further isolation. The amino group of compound 9 was deprotected by adding a 4N solution of HCl in dioxane to compound 9 at 10-15° C. in methylene chloride. The HCl salt of the free amino species, compound 10 was isolated by filtration from diethyl ether. Isolation of compound 10 was performed through recrystallization using a dimethylformamide/dichloromethane solvent system. Example 3 Compound 5 was treated with triethylamine (TEA, 5 equivalents) and 2-(7-Aza-1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU, 1.25 equivalents) for 10 minutes in dimethylformamide (DMF), and then compound 10 was added to the solution. After stirring at room temperature for 18 hours, the product, compound 11 was isolated in 70% yield. Removal of the trityl protecting group was accomplished by treating compound 11, with HCl in dioxane (4 N, excess) at room temperature for 2 hours, diethyl ether added, and the solid product, compound 12, was isolated by filtration in 95% yield. The compound 12 exists in both amorphous and crystalline form and can be isolated in either form. Example 3A Compound 5 was dissolved in isopropyl acetate and cooled to 20 to 25° C. Thionyl chloride was added, with cooling to 10 to 15° C., and N-methylmorpholine was added slowly. The reaction was monitored by HPLC. Compound 10, water, and isopropyl acetate were stirred at 15 to 20° C. until a solution was achieved. N-methylmorpholine was added followed by addition of the Compound 5 reaction mixture (acid chloride of Compound 5). The reaction was monitored by HPLC. Upon completion, the biphasic layers were allowed to settle, and the aqueous layer was removed. The upper organic layer was extracted with water, and the remaining organic layer was distilled under vacuum. Dioxane and IpAc were added with further distillation. Once dry, 4N anhydrous HCl in dioxane was added. The mixture was stirred at 20 to 25° C. for 12 hours, and checked for complete deprotection by HPLC.

The crude compound (1 equivalent) was dissolved in ethanol and added to a mixture of water and phosphoric acid (85%, 15 equivalents) over 30 min while keeping the temperature below 50° C. After stirring for 20 hrs at room temperature, another 200 ml of phosphoric acid (85%) was added and the mixture was heated to 50° C. for an additional two hrs. After removal of ethanol by rotary evaporation, the material was extacted with toluene, washed with water, dried with sodium sulfate, treated with charcoal, filtered and dried down to an oil. This oil was distilled to afford ethyl benzofuran-6-carboxylate, compound 6″, (bp 111-114.5° C.) which crystallized on standing. Compound 6″ was recovered at 57% yield based on compound 1″. Compound 6″ (875 mmol) was dissolved in methanol and tetrahydrofuran (THF). Sodium hydroxide (4 M, 3 equivalents) was added and the reaction was stirred overnight. After concentration via rotary evaporation, the aqueous solution was extracted with methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), acidified to pH 2 with the addition of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and cooled resulting in fine crystals of benzofuran-6-carboxylic acid, i.e., compound 18′. Compound 18′ was isolated, washed with water and dried to a final yield of 97% yield. Example 5 The benzofuran carboxylic acid 18′ was treated with oxalyl chloride (1.2 equivalents) and a catalytic amount of DMF, stirring for 5.5 hours until a clear solution was obtained. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the acid chloride of compound 18′ was stored under argon until use, on the next day. The acid chloride, in methylene chloride was added slowly to a methylene chloride solution of the compound of Formula 12 and diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) which was cooled to 0-5° C. The reaction was not permitted to rise above 5° C., and after completion of addition, was stirred at 5° C. for a further 0.5 hour. Upon aqueous workup and extraction with methylene chloride, the product, compound 19, was isolated in quantitative yield. The benzyl ester of compound 19 was removed by transfer hydrogenolysis using 10% palladium on carbon, using formic acid and triethylamine in a 5:1 mixture of methanol:THF, to produce the compound of Formula I in 95% yield. A final step of slurrying in methyl ethylketone (MEK) produced Form A of the compound of Formula I. The product was washed with water to remove residual MEK. Alternatively, the product of the hydrogenolysis step was slurried in acetonitrile to yield Form A of the compound of Formula I. Taking the compound of Formula I directly as the crude reaction product after transfer hydrogenolysis, and reconcentrating down from a solution in methylene chloride, the amorphous form of the compound of Formula I was obtained in 97% purity. Example 6 An alternative protection strategy was performed in Scheme E6. Boc-protection was used for the ring nitrogen in the intermediates 21 and 22. Compound 5 was deprotected with HCl in dioxane to produce compound 23 in better than 97% yield. Boc-protection was introduced, using di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (1.1 equivalent), and compound 21 was obtained in better than 95% yield. Compound 10 was coupled with compound 21 to obtain compound 22, using HATU and triethylamine in DMF. The product, compound 22, was obtained in quantitative yield, and greater than 90% purity. Deprotection with HCl yielded the compound of Formula 12 in 97.4% yield. Transfer hydrogenolysis of compound 19 produced the compound of Formula I with optical purity of 98.5% (S) enantiomer compared to 79-94.5% (S) enantiomer optical purity obtained by hydrolysis of the corresponding methyl ester. Example 6A Example 6 was repeated with thionyl chloride to form the acid chloride for amide bond coupling in place of HATU. Example 7 An alternate strategy to convert compound 19 into Formula I was performed by base hydrolysis of the benzyl ester (compound 19). Compound 19 ((S)-benzyl 2-(2-(benzofuran-6carbonyl)-5,7-dichloro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-6-carboxamido)-3-(3-methylsulfonyl)phenyl)propanoate) (70.9 mmol) was dissolved in dioxane and water was added. This solution was cooled to 8° C. Over 45 minutes, NaOH (0.5 M) was added to 68.0 mmol. After stirring for 2 hrs, the dioxane was removed by rotary evaporation. The aqueous solution was extracted twice with toluene to remove unreacted starting material. Ethyl actetate was added to the aqueous layer and with vigorous stirring the aqueous layer was acidified to pH 2 with HCl (4 M aqueous). After stirring, the layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined ethyl acetate fractions were washed with brine, dried with sodium sulfate and evaporated to dryness resulting in a foam which was 95% pure by HPLC and had a 94.8% ee. This foam was dissolved in methyl ethylketone (MEK) and was seeded with crystals (99% pure, 99% ee) which resulted in thick crystallization. After stirring for 24 hr, the suspension was filtered and washed with water and dried under vacuum. The yield of Formula I was 77% with a purity of 98.9% and 97.9% ee optical purity. An additional crop of Formula I (>98% pure) was obtained through concentration of the mother liquor. Example 8 An alternative coupling, deprotection, and purification process was performed. Compound 18′ was dissolved in isopropyl acetate and the temperature adjusted to 20 to 25° C. Thionyl chloride was added, and the temperature was adjusted to 10 to 15° C. N-methylmorpholine was added. The reaction was monitored by HPLC. Compound 12 was dissolved in water, methyl ethyl ketone, and N-methylmorpholine, and this mixture was cooled to 15 to 20° C. The acid chloride solution of Compound 18′ was added slowly and stirred for 30 minutes. The reaction was monitored by HPLC. Seeds of Compound 19 were added, and the mixture was stirred for 1 hour, and then a portion of the organic solvents were distilled under vacuum. The mixture was cooled to 20 to 25° C. and stirred for 2 hours, and filtered. The filter cake was washed with isopropyl acetate, and then the filter cake was slurried in water, filtered, washed with water, and dried at 40° C. under vacuum for a yield of 90%. Compound 19 was mixed with acetone, water, and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAH) and stirred at 18 to 22° C. until a solution was achieved. 2N sodium hydroxide was added slowly over 1 hour, and stirred at 25° C. until HPLC indicated that the reaction was complete. The mixture was distilled under vacuum at 30 to 35° C. to remove acetone. The resulting solution was cooled to 10° C. and 4N aq HCl was added maintaining a temperature of less than 15° C., to pH ˜2. The suspension that forms was stirred for about an hour, filtered, and the filter cake was washed with water. The wet cake was suspended in acetone and water (about 2/1) and warmed to 40 to 45° C. to effect solution. The solution was filtered through a 10 micron filter. The mixture was cooled to 18 to 22° C. Seeds were added and the mixture was stirred for 12 hours. The product was collected by filtration, and washed with 30% aqueous acetone, and dried under vacuum at 45 to 55° C. for a yield of 88%. Example 9 Crude compound of Formula I was recrystallized in 10 volumes of methyl ethyl ketone with stirring for 3 days to yield purified compound of Formula I in 60-65% yield. Example 10 Crude compound of Formula I was recrystallized in 30% aqueous acetone followed by one volume water over 24-36 hours to yield purified compound of Formula I in 73-77% yield. Example 10A Crude compound of Formula I is recrystallized in 30% aqueous acetone followed by one volume water over 24-36 hours to yield purified compound of Formula I in 80-90% yield with multiple filtrations. The obtained compound of Formula I has no detectable residue of methyl ethyl ketone. Example 11 Crystalline Form II Small Scale Synthesis Approximately 50 mg of crystalline Form I was dissolved in acetone (2.5 mL) at 50° C. The solution was polish filtered into a preheated container. Anti-solvent, n-heptane was added and the mixture was placed in a refrigerator at about 5° C. The resulting solid was filtered and dried under vacuum. Scale Up Synthesis Approximately 320 mg of Form I was dissolved in acetone (15 mL). The solution was polish filtered into a preheated vial. Then n-heptane (10 mL) was added and the mixture was refrigerated for 30 min. The cooled solution was seeded with Form II material and allowed to equilibrate for 12 h at 5° C. The resulting solid was filtered and dried overnight under vacuum. The 1H-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectrum of crystalline Form II shown in FIG. 6 is consistent with structure of compound and contains 0.2 wt % acetone. The crystalline Form II comprises a powder x-ray diffraction pattern as shown in FIG. 4 with an acicular morphology as indicated in FIG. 5. DSC analysis of Form II shows a small endotherm at 37.8° C., likely due to loss of acetone and/or water, and a melting transition at 155.5° C. as presented in FIG. 7. The thermal events assigned in the DSC thermogram of Form II are consistent with the observations from hot stage microscopy analysis of the polymorph. A thermogravimetric analysis graph of crystalline Form II is shown in FIG. 8. A mass loss of 1.5 wt %, attributed to liberation of water during the melt, followed by onset of decomposition at 260° C. is observed. Gravimetric moisture sorption analysis reveals that Form II is moderately hygroscopic, absorbing 3.0 wt % water at 60% relative humidity and 3.4 wt % water at 90% relative humidity. The water content of the Form II under 40% relative humidity is 2.8 wt %, which is close to the theoretical water content of a mono-hydrate of the compound (2.9 wt %). The water content of Form II by Karl Fisher titration is 3.2 wt %, again in-line with a monohydrate of compound.
