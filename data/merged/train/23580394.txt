Optoelectronic Processes in Squaraine Dye-Doped OLEDs for Emission in the Near-Infrared.
A novel all-organic host-guest system for emission in the NIR is introduced and investigated with respect to its opto-electronic processes.
The good agreement between theoretical and experimental results highlights the model character of this system and its potential for electroluminescent application.
Comparative measurements provide access to the recombination mechanisms on molecular length scale and show that the emission behavior of the device under operation is controlled by charge carrier dynamics.
