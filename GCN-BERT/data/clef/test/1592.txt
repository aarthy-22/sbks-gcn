Technical Field The present invention relates to a new nitrile compound and a fragrance composition containing the same. Background Art Fragrance is an important element that creates, for example, preference, a sense of luxury, a sense of ease, and expectations for the effect for products and the like. Furthermore, a distinctive fragrance provides a product differentiation effect and the capacity for attracting customers. On the other hand, in order to control, for example, a long-lasting property and balance of fragrance, generally, a fragrance is imparted to a product using a fragrance composition in which a plurality of fragrance materials are mixed together. It is required for the fragrance materials composing the fragrance composition to be highly harmonious with other fragrance materials. Cuminyl nitrile, which is a p-isopropylbenzonitrile having a cumin odor, is known as a fragrance material having a cyclic structure and a nitrile structure, while, for example, Peonile (Givaudan), which is 2-cyclohexylidene-2-phenylacetonitrile having grapefruit-, geranium-, and rose floral-like odors, is known as a fragrance material having a cyclohexane ring and a nitrile structure. (Non-Patent Document 1). In addition, Patent Document 1 describes that 3-cyclohexyl-2,2-dimethylpropanenitrile has intense mint-, marine-, and spicy-like odors, while Patent Document 2 describes that ß-(2,4-dimethylcyclohexyl)propionitrile has a spicy caraway fragrance and the unsaturated compound thereof has a herbal-spicy and green fragrance. Furthermore, Patent Document 3 describes that 5-cyclohexyl-3-methylpentanenitrile has wax-, fruit-, cinnamon-, formic acid-, and lemon-like odors. Very roughly speaking, fragrance materials have similar fragrance notes when they have similar structures to each other, but there are many exceptions. Particularly, when a plurality of substituents are combined to change the fragrance note, it is difficult to predict how the fragrance note will change and it also is difficult to predict the harmonicity with other fragrance materials.

This was reacted at 25°C for 19 hours and thereby a reaction mixture was obtained. The reaction mixture thus obtained was subjected to gas chromatography analysis and as a result, the conversion ratio of the 4-cyclohexyl-3-pentenenitrile (I-2) into 4-cyclohexyl-2-pentenenitrile (I-1) was 95.1% and the total reaction yield of the 4-cyclohexyl-2-pentenenitrile (I-1) and the 4-cyclohexyl-3-pentenenitrile (I-2) was 8.8%. Furthermore, the mass ratio of the 4-cyclohexyl-2-pentenenitrile (I-1) to the 4-cyclohexyl-3-pentenenitrile (I-2) was 43.8/56.2, which was determined from the GC area ratio. The ratio of isomers of the 4-cyclohexyl-2-pentenenitrile (I-1) was E-isomers : Z-isomers = 39 : 61, which was determined from the GC area ratio, while the ratio of isomers of the 4-cyclohexyl-3-pentenenitrile (I-2) was E-isomers: Z-isomers = 67 : 33, which was determined from the GC area ratio. Example 9 (Production of 4-Cyclohexylpentanenitrile (I-3)) (a) (Production of Ethyl 2-Cyano-4-Cyclohexylpenta-2-enoate (VII-1)) According to the following scheme, 2-cyclohexylpropanal (II) ("Pollenal II" (Trade Name), manufactured by Kao Corporation) and ethyl cyanoacetate (VI-1) were condensed and thereby ethyl 2-cyano-4-cyclohexylpenta-2-enoate (VII-1) was obtained. In Formula (VII-1), the bond represented by a wavy line indicates a cis form, a trans form, or a mixture of a cis form and a trans form. In a 2L flask with a distillation tube attached thereto, 475 g of ethyl cyanoacetate (VI-1) (4.20 moles, 1.05 times by mole with respect to the 2-cyclohexylpropanal (II)), 6.0 g of acetic acid (0.10 millimole, 0.025 times by mole with respect to the 2-cyclohexylpropanal (II)), and 3.4 g of piperidine (40 millimoles, 0.01 times by mole with respect to the 2-cyclohexylpropanal (II)) were placed, which then was stirred at room temperature. Then, 561 g (4.00 moles) of 2-cyclohexylpropanal (II) ("Pollenal II" (Trade Name), manufactured by Kao Corporation) was dropped thereinto over 40 minutes. Thereafter, this was heated to 50°C, the pressure was reduced gradually to 4.0 kPa over two hours, and the reaction was continued while by-product water was removed. Furthermore, excessive ethyl cyanoacetate was distilled under 130 Pa at 110°C. Then, 921 g of the concentrated liquid thus obtained was subjected to gas chromatography quantitative analysis.

Then, after the palladium carbon was filtered, isopropanol was distilled. Thereafter, 490g of the concentrated liquid thus obtained was subjected to gas chromatography analysis. As a result, the conversion ratio of the ethyl 2-cyano-4-cyclohexylpenta-2-enoate (VII-1) was 100% and the ethyl 2-cyano-4-cyclohexylpentanoate (VIII-1) had a purity of 96.5% and a reaction yield of 100%.

In a 2L flask, 400 g of the ethyl 2-cyano-4-cyclohexylpenta-2-enoate (VII-1) (with a purity of 98.0% and a pure content of 392 g, 1.67 moles) that was synthesized in Example 9(a) was placed, which then was stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere at 50°C. Then, an aqueous solution composed of 31.6 g of sodium borohydride (0.835 mole, 0.50 times by mole with respect to the ethyl 2-cyano-4-cyclohexylpenta-2-enoate (VII-1)) and 284 g of 0.1M sodium hydroxide aqueous solution was dropped thereinto over two hours while the dropping rate was adjusted so that the internal temperature did not exceed 60°C. Furthermore, this was stirred at 50°C for 15 minutes until the generation of gas from the system stopped. Thereafter, it was cooled to room temperature and then 480 g of 1M sulfuric acid aqueous solution was dropped thereinto. Then ethyl acetate was added to the reaction solution, the aqueous layer in the lower layer was extracted by settled separation, and the organic layer was washed twice with saturated brine. The organic layer thus obtained was dried with sodium sulfate, which then was filtered. Thereafter, the solvent was distilled and thereby 450 g of concentrated liquid was obtained. This liquid was subjected to gas chromatography analysis. As a result, the conversion ratio of the ethyl 2-cyano-4-cyclohexylpenta-2-enoate (VII-1) was 100% and the ethyl 2-cyano-4-cyclohexylpentanoate (VIII-1) had a purity of 70.3% and a reaction yield of 79.9%.
