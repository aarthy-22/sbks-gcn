SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR PROVIDING A THERMOPLASTIC PRODUCT THAT INCLUDES PACKAGING THEREFOR Technical Field The present disclosure relates to thermoplastic products. In particular, the present invention relates to systems and methods for providing a thermoplastic product that includes packaging therefor, wherein the packaging is used to contain one or more ingredients of the thermoplastic product during storage and/or transportation, and wherein the packaging itself is an ingredient for inclusion into the thermoplastic product. Background and Related Art While techniques currently exist relating to pavement joint sealants, pavement crack sealants, waterproofing membranes, hot melt adhesives, roofing asphalt, paving grade asphalt cement, challenges exist. Upon manufacturing pavement joint or crack sealants, waterproofing membranes, or hot melt adhesives, the sealants, membranes or adhesives are typically pumped or poured into plastic bag lined cardboard boxes at temperatures lower than the melting point of the plastic bag liners, then are stacked on pallets for cooling, storage and shipment. When the sealants, membranes, or adhesives are applied, they may be used to minimize water infiltration, prevent the accumulation of debris, and prolong the life of a material or structure. Examples of such materials include asphalt pavement and Portland cement pavement. Examples of such structures include roads, roofs, bridge decks, retention ponds, etc. Application of the sealants, waterproofing membranes, or hot melt adhesives typically requires heating and mixing at application temperatures. Challenges exist in using plastic bag lined cardboard boxes for products, such as packaging sealants, waterproofing membranes, or hot melt adhesives. For example, prior to application of the products, if the cardboard boxes are exposed to water, the structural integrity of the cardboard boxes is compromised. When the integrity of the box is compromised, the plastic bag liner can also become compromised. Moreover, the product can escape from the storage boxes and become unusable, which may not only become a waste of the product but also an unsightly pile at the storage or job site. In addition, whenever the product sticks to another material, including the storage container, it can require a very time consuming and arduous task to eliminate the foreign material from the product and can even cause the product to become unusable. Challenges also exist in the roofing asphalt industry. Upon manufacturing roofing asphalt, the roofing asphalt is typically poured into silicone coated paper containers or roofing plugs at high temperatures and allowed to solidify when cooled. The filled roofing plugs are typically about 100 pounds each, and can prove difficult and potentially hazardous to handle. In order to use the roofing plug, the paper packaging needs to be peeled from the plug, leaving a large and unwieldy piece of roofing plug, which is difficult to handle and can cause injury to operators. There is also a risk of dropping or mishandling the roofing plug when placing it into the roofing asphalt melter, causing hot asphalt to splash onto the operator, causing serious bums. Challenges exist in shipping this type of container in warm weather conditions, as the paper containers can become compromised when exposed to water. The roofing asphalt softens in summer weather and can flow or otherwise escape from the compromised containers, which may not only become a waste of the roofing asphalt but also an unsightly pile at the storage or job site. In addition, whenever the roofing asphalt sticks to another material, it can require a very time consuming and arduous task to eliminate the foreign material from the roofing asphalt and can even cause the roofing asphalt to become unusable. Challenges also exist relating to paving grade asphalt cement. In some markets, paving grade asphalt cement is shipped in metal containers, such as 55 gallon metal drums. The metal drums pose an environmental challenge to customers because they cannot be economically returned to the manufacturer, nor can they be easily recycled or reused in remote areas because they are contaminated with asphalt and/or the recycling facilities are not within economical shipping distance. Thus, while techniques currently exist relating to pavement joint sealants, pavement crack sealants, waterproofing membranes, hot melt adhesives, roofing asphalt, paving grade asphalt cement, challenges exist. Accordingly, it would be an improvement in the art to augment or even replace current techniques with other techniques. SUMMARY The present disclosure relates to thermoplastic products. In particular, the present disclosure relates to systems and methods for providing a thermoplastic product that includes packaging therefor. In a first aspect, there is provided a method for providing a sealant product for use, the method comprising: providing a non-asphalt thermoplastic container that is configured to receive a volume of one or more ingredients for inclusion into a sealant product, the thermoplastic container comprising an expanded polymer; providing said volume of said one or more ingredients into said non-asphalt thermoplastic container; mixing at least a portion of said non-asphalt thermoplastic container and said volume of ingredients to produce a volume of said sealant product; and using said sealant product. Implementation of the present disclosure can take place in association with packaging of one or more ingredients of a thermoplastic product, wherein the packaging can be used to contain the ingredients during storage and/or transportation, and wherein at least a portion of the packaging itself can be an ingredient for inclusion into the thermoplastic product.

Accordingly, at the job site, one or more containers with ingredients therein may be combined to obtain a thermoplastic product for application onto one or more surfaces. Therefore, the applied thermoplastic product can include the container that was used to store and/or transport the ingredients prior to mixture of the thermoplastic product. In some embodiments, the pallet itself and/or any wrap or other packaging is also included as an ingredient that is combined to obtain the thermoplastic product. Therefore, in some embodiments, the applied thermoplastic product includes all of the packaging, including the container, the pallet and any other packaging that was used to store and/or transport the ingredients prior to mixture of the thermoplastic product. In at least some implementations, generation of a thermoplastic product for application to a surface can include providing a thermoplastic product ingredient container having a volume of thermoplastic product ingredients; mixing the thermoplastic product ingredient container and the volume of thermoplastic product ingredients to produce a volume of a thermoplastic product; and applying the thermoplastic product mixture to the surface. In at least some implementations, the mixing of the thermoplastic product ingredient container and the volume of a thermoplastic product comprises heating the mixture. In one implementation, the mixture is heated to about 250°F to 450°F. However, other embodiments embrace other temperature ranges. In a second aspect there is provided a package configured to form a thermoplastic mixture, the package comprising: a non-asphalt thermoplastic container comprising an expanded polymer, and a raw material disposed within the non-asphalt thermoplastic container, wherein the raw material is combinable with the non-asphalt thermoplastic container to provide a sealant composition. In an embodiment, the package comprises a vent to dissipate heat from an interior of the non-asphalt thermoplastic container. In an embodiment, the non-asphalt thermoplastic container comprises a base portion comprising the expanded polymer. In an embodiment, the non-asphalt thermoplastic container may comprise expanded polystyrene.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present disclosure relates to thermoplastic products. In particular, the present invention relates to systems and methods for providing a thermoplastic product that includes packaging therefor. Embodiments take place in association with packaging one or more ingredients of a thermoplastic product, wherein the packaging is used to contain the ingredients during storage and/or transportation, and wherein at least a portion of the packaging itself is an ingredient for inclusion into the thermoplastic product. In some implementations, the entire packaging is incorporated into the thermoplastic product for utilization thereof. The packaging may be created using an expanded, formed, molded, injected, injection molded, foam injection molded, expanded bead injection molded, welded, compression molded, but out and/or other process. In one embodiment, the container is created using expanded beads and/or injected products. In another embodiment, the container comprises a fusable filler material. In the disclosure and in the claims the term "thermoplastic product" shall include one or more polymeric materials that are solid or semisolid at ambient temperatures and that soften and/or melt when heated. At least some thermoplastic products can be reformed repeatedly without significant change in composition or properties. With reference now to Figure 1, a representative embodiment is illustrated that includes one or more ingredients for a thermoplastic product included in a container for storage and/or transportation, and wherein the container itself is an ingredient for inclusion into the thermoplastic product. The ingredients in the container can be a homogenous product, a heterogeneous mixture, or specifically measured ingredients that are used along with the container to create a thermoplastic product when combined with the container at, for example, elevated temperatures. In Figure 1, a representative thermoplastic ingredient container is illustrated as durable container 10 having a base 12 and lid 14. Base 12 is configured to receive a volume of one or more thermoplastic product ingredients 16. The combination of base 12 and lid 14 protects ingredients 16 from contaminates and the weather. In the illustrated embodiment, portion 18 of lid 14 couples to or otherwise extends into ingredients 16 to maintain lid 14 coupled to base 12. Accordingly, container 10 is configured to contain a volume of thermoplastic product ingredients and comprises a polymer or other material that is pre-calculated to be used as an ingredient in the applied thermoplastic product mixture or material. Examples of polymer materials include polystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene, ethylene vinyl acetate, styrene butadiene styrene block copolymers, styrene butadiene rubber or another polymer material. In one embodiment, the packaging is a polymer container, such as a plastic or plastic foam container, which is itself thermoplastic. In some embodiments, the thermoplastic product ingredient packaging comprises inter-receiving and/or interlocking containers that increase stability when stacked. For example, the embodiment illustrated in Figure 1 provides a representative container 10 that is configured to be interlocking with other corresponding containers. In particular, top surface of lid 14 includes one or more receiving portions 19 that are configured to receive corresponding protrusions located at a bottom surface of a base of a similar container. In at least some embodiments, the container insulates the ingredients in the container. While Figure 1 and the corresponding discussion provide an embodiment of the present invention, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the embodiment is representative only. Accordingly, embodiments can embrace a variety of materials, shapes, configurations and/or sizes for providing a thermoplastic product that includes packaging therefor, wherein the packaging is used to contain thermoplastic product ingredients during storage and/or transportation, at least a portion of the packaging being incorporated into the thermoplastic product for utilization thereof. In the illustrated embodiment, the packaging (illustrated as container 10) contributes to the structural stability of an individual container and a pallet or partial pallet, as will be further discussed below. In some embodiments, the container is weather proof, resistant to ozone and/or other free radicals in the atmosphere, resistant to ultra violet light from the sun, compatible with the thermoplastic product, and/or able to undergo a process of being mixed at application temperature into the thermoplastic product. Furthermore, the container resists cracking and/or melting at storage temperatures, resists cracking and/or melting at packaging temperatures, is strong enough to contain the thermoplastic product ingredients, and/or is able to maintain structural soundness during storage and transportation. With reference now to Figure 2, a perspective top view of another representative container lid in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. In Figure 2, lid 20 includes one or more protrusions 22 that are configured to be received by one or more corresponding receiving portions of a bottom surface of a base, such as receiving portions 50 of base 40 (illustrated in Figure 5). Additionally, lid 20 includes a label or marking 24 and handles 26. With reference to Figure 3, a bottom perspective view is provided of lid 20. At least some embodiments include one or more vents that allow heat to dissipate. In the illustrated embodiment, channel 32 is created between structures 30 and 34 to enable the dissipation of heat at channel 32. Additionally, in the illustrated embodiment, handle 26 (Figure 2) includes surface 36, which also enables the dissipation of heat. In Figure 4, a perspective top view of a representative container 40 is illustrated, wherein container 40 includes surface 42, which corresponds to surface 36 (Figure 3) to enable the dissipation of heat. Additionally, lip 44 is configured to receive lid 20, and enables heat to dissipate. As provided above, Figure 5 illustrates a perspective bottom view of a representative container 40 that includes receiving portions 50, which are configured to selectively receive corresponding protrusions of a container lit to enable the containers to interlock. While the containers illustrated in Figures 1-5 illustrate containers that interlock at their top and bottom surfaces, those skilled in the art will appreciate that other embodiments embrace an interlocking nature on any surface of the containers. With reference now to Figure 6, a representative method for obtaining a thermoplastic product for use is provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In Figure 6, execution begins at step 60, wherein a container is provided that is configured to receive one or more ingredients for a thermoplastic product. At decision block 62, a determination is made as to whether or not the ingredients to be placed into the container are to be pre-mixed. In some embodiments, a pre-mixing process occurs in advance of placing the ingredients into the container. In one embodiment, the pre-mixing process includes heating and mixing various ingredients. If it is determined at decision block 62 that ingredients are to be pre-mixed, execution proceeds to step 64, where the pre-mixing takes place. The pre-mixed ingredients are then placed into the container at step 66. Alternatively, if it is determined at decision block 62 that the ingredients are not to be pre-mixed, execution proceeds directly to step 66. At step 66, one or more ingredients for a thermoplastic product are placed into a container. The containers are then used to store and transport the ingredients. At a mixing site, such as at a j ob or other site, one or more containers with the ingredients therein are mixed together at step 70 to obtain a thermoplastic product. In at least some embodiments, the process for mixing includes providing heat to mix the ingredients, including at least a portion of the containers. In at least some embodiments, the entire containers are included in the mixing process to obtain the thermoplastic product. At step 72, the thermoplastic product is then applied for use. Accordingly, the applied thermoplastic product includes at least a portion of the container and/or packaging that was used to store and/or transport thermoplastic product ingredients prior to application of the combined mixture onto a surface. Application of the thermoplastic product to a surface includes providing a thermoplastic product container having a volume of thermoplastic product; heating and mixing the thermoplastic product ingredient container and the volume of thermoplastic product ingredients to produce a volume of a thermoplastic product mixture; and applying the thermoplastic product mixture to the surface. In another representative embodiment for applying a thermoplastic product to a surface, the various raw materials are obtained and then combined. By way of example, the raw materials are weighed and then transferred into a mixing tank. The materials are then heated to the appropriate temperature for mixing (e.g., 300°F 430°F or another temperature). The ingredient mixture is then cooled to a packaging temperature (e.g., 200°- 215°F or another temperature). Examples of raw materials for inclusion into a thermoplastic product include rubber and plastic thermoplastic elastomers, Polybutadienes, Styrene Butadiene Styrene Block Copolymers, Styrene Isobutyl Butadiene Copolymer, Styrene Ethylene Butadiene Styrene, Hydrogenated Styrene Butadiene Styrene, Styrene Butadiene Rubber, Nitrile Rubber, Ethylene Butadiene Styrene, Synthetic Latex, Latex, Natural Rubber, Olefins, Polyolefins, Polyethylene, High Density Polyethylene, Low Density Polyethylene, Linear Low Density Polyethylene, Polypropylene, High Density Polypropylene, Low Density Polypropylene, Ethylene Propylene Copolymer, Polystyrene, High Density Polystyrene, Low Density Polystyrene, High Impact Polystyrene, Polybutylene, Polyisobutylene, Perlite Microspheres, Ceramic Microspheres, Talc, Glass, Asphalt Cement, Light Oils, Vacuum Gas Oils, Ground Tire Rubber, Roofing Asphalt, Kaolin, Limestone, Sodium Bentonite, Sulfur, any grade of asphalt, one or more oils, one or more polymers, styrene butadiene styrene block copolymers, mineral fillers, aggregates, fiber, roofing asphalt, tar sands, Trinidad lake asphalt, Great Salt Lake oil, plasticizers, anti-strip agents, or other materials. Any of such materials may be comprised in the container. The ingredient mixture is then transferred into packaging containers, such as the sealant packaging or containers discussed herein. By way of example, the process of transferring can include: (i) pumping the ingredient mixture through a colloid mill to a mix tank and/or packaging tank; (ii) adding measured amounts of ground talc, ground tire rubber, and ground sodium bentonite to the mixture coming from the mix tank; (iii) allowing the packaging tank to agitate; (iv) adding a measured amount of ground limestone while agitating; and (ν) packaging the resulting mixture. The packaged mixture may be cooled to a packaging temperature (e.g., 180°F-250°F or another temperature) or an ambient temperature. The containers are then stacked and transported, such as to a job site. The packaged ingredients and corresponding sealant containeds) are combined to form a thermoplastic product. In at least some embodiments, the combination of the mixture and container includes melting the mixture and/or packaging, and creating the thermoplastic product, which is applied to one or more surfaces. With reference now to Figure 7, a representative embodiment is illustrated, wherein a container 80 includes one or more pre-mixed ingredients, and wherein the container and the pre-mixed ingredients are for inclusion into the thermoplastic product.

In some embodiments, the packaging comprises a durable container that is configured to receive a volume of one or more ingredients. The durable container is used to hold the one or more ingredients during storage and/or transportation, and contributes to the structural stability of an individual container and a stack of containers (i.e., a pallet or partial pallet of containers). In further implementations, the durable container is interlocking with other durable containers, which further contributes to the structural stability of a stack of containers. In some embodiments, the durable container is a thermoplastic or is capable of becoming part of a thermoplastic product. It can be molded, formed, or created through a process to be any shape or size, to be conducive for the packaging product or specific application requirements or equipment needs. The container is durable and structural by itself and/or as part of a larger combination of other containers that are stacked on a pallet or in another shipping method. In some embodiments, the container remains rigid and is not structurally compromised at any ambient temperature where the container would be shipped or stored. In some embodiments, expanded polystyrene polymer or any other expanded polymer is used. In one embodiment, linerar low density polyethylene plastic buckets or low density polyethylene plastic buckets are used as the containers.

In some embodiments, the durable container is solid or semi-solid at ambient temperatures, and is heated and mixed with other ingredients to create the thermoplastic product. Accordingly, at the job site, one or more containers with ingredients therein may be combined to obtain a thermoplastic product for application onto one or more surfaces. Therefore, the applied thermoplastic product includes the container that was used to store and/or transport the ingredients prior to mixture of the thermoplastic product. In some embodiments, generation of a thermoplastic product for application to a surface includes providing a thermoplastic product ingredient container having a volume of thermoplastic product ingredients; mixing the thermoplastic product ingredient container and the volume of thermoplastic product ingredients to produce a volume of a thermoplastic product; and applying the thermoplastic product mixture to the surface. In at least some implementations, the mixing of the thermoplastic product ingredient container and the volume of thermoplastic product ingredients to produce a volume of a thermoplastic product comprises heating the mixture. In one implementation, the mixture is heated to about 250° to 450°F. However, other embodiments embrace other temperature ranges. While the methods and processes of embodiments can be particularly useful in the area of pavement crack sealants, joint sealants, other sealants, waterproofing membranes, roofing asphalt, paving grade asphalt cement, and hot melt adhesives, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the methods and processes of the present invention can be used in a variety of different applications and in a variety of different areas of manufacture to yield a thermoplastic product for application to a surface, wherein the thermoplastic product includes its storage and/or transportation container as an ingredient thereof when applied to a surface. Examples include pavement maintenance (e.g., asphalt crack sealants, concrete joint sealants, bridge deck membranes, bridge expansion joint sealants, wide crack sealants, pothole patching products, concrete spall repair products, concrete patching products, paving joint adhesives, traffic loop detector sealants, pavement marker adhesives, colored sealants and products, hot applied rubberized chip seal binders, chip seal binder additives, hot applied seal coats, etc.), roofing (e.g., shingle tab adhesives, shingle lamination adhesives, waterproofing membranes, polymer roofing asphalt, polymer modified bitumen, blown roofing asphalt, planter box membranes, rolled roofing seam adhesives, ice and snow shields, vertical surface adhesives, vertical surface repair, perforation repair, white hot applied waterproofing membranes and top coatings, sliver hot applied waterproofing membranes and top coatings, gray hot applied waterproofing membranes and top coatings, etc.), paving (e.g., paving grade asphalt cement, polymer modified paving asphalt cement, paving additives and modifiers, etc.) gaskets, thermoplastic paints, hot melt adhesives, extruded rubber products, pre-weighed polymers, and any process that uses batch inclusion packaging for raw materials. Embodiments embrace a container that protects the ingredients contained therein from the weather and from water, and is less likely to leak and spill. The container does not require removal as it is just included into the melter/applicator when creating the thermoplastic product. The container can allow the ingredients to be packaged in any convenient shape or size for any particular purpose. Thus, as discussed herein, the embodiments embrace thermoplastic products. In particular, embodiments of the present invention relate to systems and methods for providing a thermoplastic product that includes packaging therefor, wherein the packaging is used to contain one or more ingredients of the thermoplastic product during storage and/or transportation, and wherein the packaging itself is an ingredient for inclusion into the thermoplastic product. The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics.
