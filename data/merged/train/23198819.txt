Bioinspired and highly oriented clay nanocomposites with a xyloglucan biopolymer matrix: extending the range of mechanical and barrier properties.
The development of clay bionanocomposites requires processing routes with nanostructural control.
Moreover, moisture durability is a concern with water-soluble biopolymers.
Here, oriented bionanocomposite coatings with strong in-plane orientation of clay platelets are for the first time prepared by continuous water-based processing.
Montmorillonite (MTM) and a "new" unmodified biological polymer (xyloglucan (XG)) are combined.
The resulting nanocomposites are characterized by FE-SEM, TEM, and XRD.
XG adsorption on MTM is measured by quartz crystal microbalance analysis.
Mechanical and gas barrier properties are measured, also at high relative humidity.
The reinforcement effects are modeled.
XG dimensions in composites are estimated using atomistic simulations.
The nanostructure shows highly oriented and intercalated clay platelets.
The reinforcement efficiency and effects on barrier properties are remarkable and are likely to be due to highly oriented and well-dispersed MTM and strong XG-MTM interactions.
Properties are well preserved in humid conditions and the reasons for this are discussed.
