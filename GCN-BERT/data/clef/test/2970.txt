REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to U.S. provisional application No. 61/549,294, filed Oct. 20, 2011, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention pertains to compounds which inhibit the activity of Wee-1 kinase, methods of making the compounds, compositions containing the compounds, and methods of treatment using the compounds. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In order to undergo proper cell division, eukaryotic cells must faithfully replicate their genome and then correctly segregate their chromosomes into two daughter cells. This process of cell division, also called the cell cycle, is a step-wise process that is governed by checkpoints to ensure genomic integrity. Upon completion of DNA replication (S-phase), cells enter a growth phase (G2-phase) prior to proceeding into mitosis for chromosome segregation (M-phase). A key regulator of mitosis is the kinase Cdk1 (as called Cdc2) (Nurse, P. (1990) Universal control mechanism regulating onset of M-phase. Nature 344, 503-508). Activation of Cdk1 results in the onset of mitosis, and its subsequent inactivation initiates the exit from mitosis. Cdk1 is activated by the binding of Cyclin A or Cyclin B. Both Cyclin A-Cdk1 and Cyclin B-Cdk1 complexes function to initiate mitosis (Lindqvist, A., et. Al. (2009) The decision to enter mitosis: feedback and redundancy in the mitotic entry network. The Journal of cell biology 185, 193-202). The degradation of Cyclin B triggers the inactivation of Cdk1, resulting in the mitotic exit and entry into a growth (G1) phase prior to beginning a new round of the cell cycle (Glotzer, M., et al. (1991) Cyclin is degraded by the ubiquitin pathway. Nature 349, 132-138). In addition to Cyclins, Cdk1 is also regulated by Wee1, an atypical tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates Cdk1 on tyrosine 15 (Y15) and inactivates Cdk1 (McGowan, C. H., et al. (1993) Human Wee1 kinase inhibits cell division by phosphorylating p34cdc2 exclusively on Tyr15. The EMBO journal 12, 75-85; Parker, L. L., et al. (1992) Inactivation of the p34cdc2-cyclin B complex by the human WEE1 tyrosine kinase. Science 257, 1955-1957). Wee1 is a critical negative regulator of Cdk1 and functions at the G2-M phase checkpoint to ensure that DNA replication has been completed and the genome is not damaged prior to entering mitosis (O'Connell, et al. (1997) Chk1 is a wee1 kinase in the G2 DNA damage checkpoint inhibiting cdc2 by Y15 phosphorylation. The EMBO journal 16, 545-554). Loss of Wee1 can result in premature entry into mitosis, resulting in mitotic catastrophe and cell death (Stumpff, J., et al. (2004) Drosophila Wee1 kinase regulates Cdk1 and mitotic entry during embryogenesis. Curr Biol 14, 2143-2148). Furthermore, many cancers are defective in their G1-phase checkpoints and are reliant on G2-M phase checkpoints (Sancar, A., et al. (2004) Molecular mechanisms of mammalian DNA repair and the DNA damage checkpoints. Annual review of biochemistry 73, 39-85). Indeed, loss of expression of Wee1 has been shown to lead to the abrogation of the G2-M phase checkpoint and sensitize tumor cells to DNA damage, especially tumors that have lost their G1-phase checkpoint due to a deficiency in the p53 protein (Wang, Y., et al. (2004) Knockdown of Chk1, Wee1 and Myt1 by RNA interference abrogates G2 checkpoint and induces apoptosis. Cancer biology & therapy 3, 305-313). Inhibitors of Wee1 have the potential to selectively cause lethality in cancerous cells that are defective in other cell cycle checkpoints, while sparing normal tissues that can activate other cell cycle checkpoints. Thus, small molecule inhibitors of Wee1 would be beneficial for therapeutic intervention in cancer and other cell proliferative disorders.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This detailed description is intended only to acquaint others skilled in the art with Applicants' invention, its principles, and its practical application so that others skilled in the art may adapt and apply the invention in its numerous forms, as they may be best suited to the requirements of a particular use. This description and its specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only. This invention, therefore, is not limited to the embodiments described in this patent application, and may be variously modified. Abbreviations and Definitions Unless otherwise defined herein, scientific and technical terms used in connection with the present invention shall have the meanings that are commonly understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. The meaning and scope of the terms should be clear, however, in the event of any latent ambiguity, definitions provided herein take precedent over any dictionary or extrinsic definition. In this application, the use of “or” means “and/or” unless stated otherwise. Furthermore, the use of the term “including”, as well as other forms, such as “includes” and “included”, is not limiting. With reference to the use of the words “comprise” or “comprises” or “comprising” in this patent application (including the claims), Applicants note that unless the context requires otherwise, those words are used on the basis and clear understanding that they are to be interpreted inclusively, rather than exclusively, and that Applicants intend each of those words to be so interpreted in construing this patent application, including the claims below. For a variable that occurs more than one time in any substituent or in the compound of the invention or any other formulae herein, its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Combinations of substituents are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. Stable compounds are compounds which can be isolated in a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture. It is meant to be understood that proper valences are maintained for all combinations herein, that monovalent moieties having more than one atom are attached through their left ends, and that divalent moieties are drawn from left to right. As used in the specification and the appended claims, unless specified to the contrary, the following terms have the meaning indicated: The term “alkyl” (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a straight- or branched-chain saturated hydrocarbyl substituent typically containing from 1 to about 10 carbon atoms; or in another embodiment, from 1 to about 8 carbon atoms; in another embodiment, from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms; and in another embodiment, from 1 to about 4 carbon atoms. Examples of such substituents include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, iso-amyl, and hexyl and the like. The term “alkenyl” (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a straight- or branched-chain hydrocarbyl substituent containing one or more double bonds and typically from 2 to about 10 carbon atoms; or in another embodiment, from 2 to about 8 carbon atoms; in another embodiment, from 2 to about 6 carbon atoms; and in another embodiment, from 2 to about 4 carbon atoms. Examples of such substituents include ethenyl (vinyl), 2-propenyl, 3-propenyl, 1,4-pentadienyl, 1,4-butadienyl, 1-butenyl, 2-butenyl, and 3-butenyl and the like. The term “alkynyl” (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a straight- or branched-chain hydrocarbyl substituent containing one or more triple bonds and typically from 2 to about 10 carbon atoms; or in another embodiment, from 2 to about 8 carbon atoms; in another embodiment, from 2 to about 6 carbon atoms; and in another embodiment, from 2 to about 4 carbon atoms. Examples of such substituents include ethynyl, 2-propynyl, 3-propynyl, 2-butynyl, and 3-butynyl and the like. The term “carbocyclyl” (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a saturated cyclic (i.e., “cycloalkyl”), partially saturated cyclic (i.e., “cycloalkenyl”), or completely unsaturated (i.e., “aryl”) hydrocarbyl substituent containing from 3 to 14 carbon ring atoms (“ring atoms” are the atoms bound together to form the ring or rings of a cyclic substituent). A carbocyclyl may be a single-ring (monocyclic) or polycyclic ring structure. A carbocyclyl may be a single ring structure, which typically contains from 3 to 8 ring atoms, more typically from 3 to 6 ring atoms, and even more typically 5 to 6 ring atoms. Examples of such single-ring carbocyclyls include cyclopropyl (cyclopropanyl), cyclobutyl (cyclobutanyl), cyclopentyl (cyclopentanyl), cyclopentenyl, cyclopentadienyl, cyclohexyl (cyclohexanyl), cyclohexenyl, cyclohexadienyl, and phenyl. A carbocyclyl may alternatively be polycyclic (i.e., may contain more than one ring). Examples of polycyclic carbocyclyls include bridged, fused, and spirocyclic carbocyclyls. In a spirocyclic carbocyclyl, one atom is common to two different rings. An example of a spirocyclic carbocyclyl is spiropentanyl. In a bridged carbocyclyl, the rings share at least two common non-adjacent atoms. Examples of bridged carbocyclyls include bicyclo[2.2.1]heptanyl, bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-enyl, and adamantanyl. In a fused-ring carbocyclyl system, two or more rings may be fused together, such that two rings share one common bond. Examples of two- or three-fused ring carbocyclyls include naphthalenyl, tetrahydronaphthalenyl (tetralinyl), indenyl, indanyl (dihydroindenyl), anthracenyl, phenanthrenyl, and decalinyl. The term “cycloalkyl” (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a saturated cyclic hydrocarbyl substituent containing from 3 to 14 carbon ring atoms. A cycloalkyl may be a single carbon ring, which typically contains from 3 to 8 carbon ring atoms and more typically from 3 to 6 ring atoms. Examples of single-ring cycloalkyls include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, and cyclohexyl. A cycloalkyl may alternatively be polycyclic or contain more than one ring. Examples of polycyclic cycloalkyls include bridged, fused, and spirocyclic carbocyclyls. The term “aryl” (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means an aromatic carbocyclyl containing from 6 to 14 carbon ring atoms. An aryl may be monocyclic or polycyclic (i.e., may contain more than one ring). In the case of polycyclic aromatic rings, only one ring the polycyclic system is required to be unsaturated while the remaining ring(s) may be saturated, partially saturated or unsaturated. Examples of aryls include phenyl, naphthalenyl, indenyl, indanyl, and tetrahydronapthyl. In some instances, the number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbyl substituent (e.g., alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, or cycloalkyl) is indicated by the prefix “Cx-Cy-”, wherein x is the minimum and y is the maximum number of carbon atoms in the substituent. Thus, for example, “C1-C6-alkyl” refers to an alkyl substituent containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Illustrating further, C3-C8-cycloalkyl means a saturated hydrocarbyl ring containing from 3 to 8 carbon ring atoms. The term “hydrogen” (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a hydrogen radical, and may be depicted as —H. The term “hydroxy” (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means —OH. The term “carboxy” (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means —C(O)—OH. The term “amino” (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means —NH2. The term “halogen” or “halo” (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a fluorine radical (which may be depicted as —F), chlorine radical (which may be depicted as —Cl), bromine radical (which may be depicted as —Br), or iodine radical (which may be depicted as —I). If a substituent is described as being “substituted”, a non-hydrogen radical is in the place of hydrogen radical on a carbon or nitrogen of the substituent. Thus, for example, a substituted alkyl substituent is an alkyl substituent in which at least one non-hydrogen radical is in the place of a hydrogen radical on the alkyl substituent. To illustrate, monofluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with a fluoro radical, and difluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with two fluoro radicals. It should be recognized that if there are more than one substitution on a substituent, each non-hydrogen radical may be identical or different (unless otherwise stated). If a substituent is described as being “optionally substituted”, the substituent may be either (1) not substituted or (2) substituted. If a substituent is described as being optionally substituted with up to a particular number of non-hydrogen radicals, that substituent may be either (1) not substituted; or (2) substituted by up to that particular number of non-hydrogen radicals or by up to the maximum number of substitutable positions on the substituent, whichever is less. Thus, for example, if a substituent is described as a heteroaryl optionally substituted with up to 3 non-hydrogen radicals, then any heteroaryl with less than 3 substitutable positions would be optionally substituted by up to only as many non-hydrogen radicals as the heteroaryl has substitutable positions. To illustrate, tetrazolyl (which has only one substitutable position) would be optionally substituted with up to one non-hydrogen radical. To illustrate further, if an amino nitrogen is described as being optionally substituted with up to 2 non-hydrogen radicals, then a primary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to 2 non-hydrogen radicals, whereas a secondary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to only 1 non-hydrogen radical. This patent application uses the terms “substituent” and “radical” interchangeably. The prefix “halo” indicates that the substituent to which the prefix is attached is substituted with one or more independently selected halogen radicals. For example, haloalkyl means an alkyl substituent in which at least one hydrogen radical is replaced with a halogen radical. Examples of haloalkyls include chloromethyl, 1-bromoethyl, fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, and 1,1,1-trifluoroethyl. It should be recognized that if a substituent is substituted by more than one halogen radical, those halogen radicals may be identical or different (unless otherwise stated). The prefix “perhalo” indicates that every hydrogen radical on the substituent to which the prefix is attached is replaced with independently selected halogen radicals, i.e., each hydrogen radical on the substituent is replaced with a halogen radical. If all the halogen radicals are identical, the prefix typically will identify the halogen radical. Thus, for example, the term “perfluoro” means that every hydrogen radical on the substituent to which the prefix is attached is substituted with a fluorine radical. To illustrate, the term “perfluoroalkyl” means an alkyl substituent wherein a fluorine radical is in the place of each hydrogen radical. The term “carbonyl” (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means —C(O)—. The term “aminocarbonyl” (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means —C(O)—NH2.

Examples of such a substituent include methoxy (—O—CH3), ethoxy, n-propoxy, isopropoxy, n-butoxy, iso-butoxy, sec-butoxy, and tert-butoxy. The term “alkylcarbonyl” (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means —C(O)-alkyl. The term “aminoalkylcarbonyl” (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means —C(O)-alkyl-NH2. The term “alkyloxycarbonyl” (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means —C(O)—O-alkyl. The term “carbocyclylcarbonyl” (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means —C(O)-carbocyclyl. Similarly, the term “heterocyclylcarbonyl” (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means —C(O)-heterocyclyl. The term “carbocyclylalkylcarbonyl” (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means —C(O)-alkyl-carbocyclyl. Similarly, the term “heterocyclylalkylcarbonyl” (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means —C(O)-alkyl-heterocyclyl. The term “carbocyclyloxycarbonyl” (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means —C(O)—O-carbocyclyl. The term “carbocyclylalkyloxycarbonyl” (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means —C(O)—O-alkyl-carbocyclyl. The term “thio” or “thia” (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a thiaether substituent, i.e., an ether substituent wherein a divalent sulfur atom is in the place of the ether oxygen atom. Such a substituent may be depicted as —S—. This, for example, “alkyl-thio-alkyl” means alkyl-S-alkyl (alkyl-sulfanyl-alkyl).

At least one of the ring atoms is a heteroatom (i.e., oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur), with the remaining ring atoms being independently selected from the group consisting of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. A heterocyclyl may be a single-ring (monocyclic) or polycyclic ring structure. A heterocyclyl may be a single ring, which typically contains from 3 to 7 ring atoms, more typically from 3 to 6 ring atoms, and even more typically 5 to 6 ring atoms.

A heterocyclyl may alternatively be polycyclic (i.e., may contain more than one ring). Examples of polycyclic heterocyclyls include bridged, fused, and spirocyclic heterocyclyls. In a spirocyclic heterocyclyl, one atom is common to two different rings. In a bridged heterocyclyl, the rings share at least two common non-adjacent atoms. In a fused-ring heterocyclyl, two or more rings may be fused together, such that two rings share one common bond. Examples of fused ring heterocyclyls containing two or three rings include indolizinyl, pyranopyrrolyl, 4H-quinolizinyl, purinyl, naphthyridinyl, pyridopyridinyl (including pyrido[3,4-b]-pyridinyl, pyrido[3,2-b]-pyridinyl, or pyrido[4,3-b]-pyridinyl), and pteridinyl. Other examples of fused-ring heterocyclyls include benzo-fused heterocyclyls, such as indolyl, isoindolyl (isobenzazolyl, pseudoisoindolyl), indoleninyl (pseudoindolyl), isoindazolyl (benzpyrazolyl), benzazinyl (including quinolinyl (1-benzazinyl) or isoquinolinyl (2-benzazinyl)), phthalazinyl, quinoxalinyl, quinazolinyl, benzodiazinyl (including cinnolinyl (1,2-benzodiazinyl) or quinazolinyl (1,3-benzodiazinyl)), benzopyranyl (including chromanyl or isochromanyl), benzoxazinyl (including 1,3,2-benzoxazinyl, 1,4,2-benzoxazinyl, 2,3,1-benzoxazinyl, or 3,1,4-benzoxazinyl), and benzisoxazinyl (including 1,2-benzisoxazinyl or 1,4-benzisoxazinyl). The term “heterocycloalkyl” (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a saturated heterocyclyl. The term “heteroaryl” (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means an aromatic heterocyclyl containing from 5 to 14 ring atoms. A heteroaryl may be a single ring or 2 or 3 fused rings.

A prefix attached to a multi-component substituent only applies to the first component. To illustrate, the term “alkylcycloalkyl” contains two components: alkyl and cycloalkyl. Thus, the C1-C6— prefix on C1-C6-alkylcycloalkyl means that the alkyl component of the alkylcycloalkyl contains from 1 to 6 carbon atoms; the C1-C6-prefix does not describe the cycloalkyl component. To illustrate further, the prefix “halo” on haloalkyloxyalkyl indicates that only the alkyloxy component of the alkyloxyalkyl substituent is substituted with one or more halogen radicals. If halogen substitution may alternatively or additionally occur on the alkyl component, the substituent would instead be described as “halogen-substituted alkyloxyalkyl” rather than “haloalkyloxyalkyl.” And finally, if the halogen substitution may only occur on the alkyl component, the substituent would instead be described as “alkyloxyhaloalkyl.” The terms “treat”, “treating” and “treatment” refer to a method of alleviating or abrogating a disease and/or its attendant symptoms. The terms “prevent”, “preventing” and “prevention” refer to a method of preventing the onset of a disease and/or its attendant symptoms or barring a subject from acquiring a disease. As used herein, “prevent”, “preventing” and “prevention” also include delaying the onset of a disease and/or its attendant symptoms and reducing a subject's risk of acquiring a disease. The term “therapeutically effective amount” refers to that amount of the compound being administered sufficient to prevent development of or alleviate to some extent one or more of the symptoms of the condition or disorder being treated. The term “modulate” refers to the ability of a compound to increase or decrease the function, or activity, of a kinase. “Modulation”, as used herein in its various forms, is intended to encompass antagonism, agonism, partial antagonism and/or partial agonism of the activity associated with kinase. Kinase inhibitors are compounds that, e.g., bind to, partially or totally block stimulation, decrease, prevent, delay activation, inactivate, desensitize, or down regulate signal transduction. Kinase activators are compounds that, e.g., bind to, stimulate, increase, open, activate, facilitate, enhance activation, sensitize or up regulate signal transduction. The term “composition” as used herein is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts. By “pharmaceutically acceptable” it is meant the carrier, diluent or excipient must be compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. The “subject” is defined herein to include animals such as mammals, including, but not limited to, primates (e.g., humans), cows, sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, rabbits, rats, mice and the like.

In particular, compounds of this invention are expected to have utility in treatment of diseases or conditions during which protein kinases such as any or all wee-1 family members are expressed. In one group of embodiments, diseases and conditions of humans or other animals that can be treated with inhibitors of kinases, include, but are not limited to, acoustic neuroma, acute leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute myelocytic leukemia (monocytic, myeloblastic, adenocarcinoma, angiosarcoma, astrocytoma, myelomonocytic and promyelocytic), acute t-cell leukemia, basal cell carcinoma, bile duct carcinoma, bladder cancer, brain cancer, breast cancer, bronchogenic carcinoma, cervical cancer, chondrosarcoma, chordoma, choriocarcinoma, chronic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelocytic (granulocytic) leukemia, chronic myleogeneous leukemia, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, craniopharyngioma, cystadenocarcinoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, dysproliferative changes (dysplasias and metaplasias), embryonal carcinoma, endometrial cancer, endotheliosarcoma, ependymoma, epithelial carcinoma, erythroleukemia, esophageal cancer, estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer, essential thrombocythemia, Ewing's tumor, fibrosarcoma, follicular lymphoma, germ cell testicular cancer, glioma, heavy chain disease, hemangioblastoma, hepatoma, hepatocellular cancer, hormone insensitive prostate cancer, leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, lung cancer, lymphagioendotheliosarcoma, lymphangiosarcoma, lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphoma (Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's), malignancies and hyperproliferative disorders of the bladder, breast, colon, lung, ovaries, pancreas, prostate, skin and uterus, lymphoid malignancies of T-cell or B-cell origin, leukemia, lymphoma, medullary carcinoma, medulloblastoma, melanoma, meningioma, mesothelioma, multiple myeloma, myelogenous leukemia, myeloma, myxosarcoma, neuroblastoma, non-small cell lung cancer, oligodendroglioma, oral cancer, osteogenic sarcoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, papillary adenocarcinomas, papillary carcinoma, pinealoma, polycythemia vera, prostate cancer, rectal cancer, renal cell carcinoma, retinoblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, sarcoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma, seminoma, skin cancer, small cell lung carcinoma, solid tumors (carcinomas and sarcomas), small cell lung cancer, stomach cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, synovioma, sweat gland carcinoma, thyroid cancer, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, testicular tumors, uterine cancer and Wilms' tumor. In one group of embodiments, diseases and conditions of humans or other animals that can be treated with inhibitors of kinases, include, but are not limited to, tumors that are deficient in the p53 protein. The p53 protein is a tumor suppressor protein that is encoded in humans by the TP53 gene. The p53 protein regulates the cell cycle and therefore functions as a tumor suppressor that is involved in preventing cancer Inhibition of Wee1 kinases sensitizes tumor cells to DNA damage and/or cell cycle perturbation, especially tumors that have lost their G1-phase checkpoint due to a deficiency in the p53 protein. A discussion of the loss of expression of Wee1 and how it relates to deficiency in the p53 protein can be found in Annual Review of Biochemistry, 2004, 73:39-85. Involvement of mutations in the p53 gene and human tumor types can be found in Nature, 1989, 342:705-708. A discussion of Wee1 kinase and p53 deficient tumor cells can be found in Molecular Cancer Therapy, 2009, 8:11. A discussion of p53 and Wee1 kinases and anti-cancer therapies can be found in BMC Cancer 2006, 6:292. A discussion of Wee1 kinase and p53 deficient tumor cells can be found in Current Clinical Pharmacology, 2010, 5:186-191. The methods of the present invention typically involve administering to a subject in need of therapeutic treatment an effective amount of a compound of formula (I). Therapeutically effective amounts of a compound having formula (I) depend on recipient of treatment, disease treated and severity thereof, composition comprising it, time of administration, route of administration, duration of treatment, potency, rate of clearance and whether or not another drug is co-administered. The amount of a compound having formula (I) used to make a composition to be administered daily to a patient in a single dose or in divided doses is from about 0.03 to about 200 mg/kg body weight. Single dose compositions contain these amounts or a combination of submultiples thereof. Combination Therapy The present invention further provides methods of using a compound or composition of the invention in combination with one or more additional active agents. Compounds having Formula (I) are expected to be useful when used with alkylating agents, angiogenesis inhibitors, antibodies, antimetabolites, antimitotics, antiproliferatives, antivirals, aurora kinase inhibitors, apoptosis promoters (for example, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w and Bfl-1) inhibitors, activators of death receptor pathway, Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors, BiTE (Bi-Specific T cell Engager) antibodies, antibody drug conjugates, biologic response modifiers, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, cell cycle inhibitors, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, DVDs, leukemia viral oncogene homolog (ErbB2) receptor inhibitors, growth factor inhibitors, heat shock protein (HSP)-90 inhibitors, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, hormonal therapies, immunologicals, inhibitors of inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), intercalating antibiotics, kinase inhibitors, kinesin inhibitors, Jak2 inhibitors, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, microRNA's, mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitors, multivalent binding proteins, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), poly ADP (adenosine diphosphate)-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, platinum chemotherapeutics, polo-like kinase (Plk) inhibitors, phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, proteosome inhibitors, purine analogs, pyrimidine analogs, receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, etinoids/deltoids plant alkaloids, small inhibitory ribonucleic acids (siRNAs), topoisomerase inhibitors, ubiquitin ligase inhibitors, and the like, and in combination with one or more of these agents. BiTE antibodies are bi-specific antibodies that direct T-cells to attack cancer cells by simultaneously binding the two cells. The T-cell then attacks the target cancer cell. Examples of BiTE antibodies include adecatumumab (Micromet MT201), blinatumomab (Micromet MT103) and the like. Without being limited by theory, one of the mechanisms by which T-cells elicit apoptosis of the target cancer cell is by exocytosis of cytolytic granule components, which include perforin and granzyme B. In this regard, Bcl-2 has been shown to attenuate the induction of apoptosis by both perforin and granzyme B. These data suggest that inhibition of Bcl-2 could enhance the cytotoxic effects elicited by T-cells when targeted to cancer cells (V. R. Sutton, D. L. Vaux and J. A. Trapani, J. of Immunology 1997, 158 (12), 5783). SiRNAs are molecules having endogenous RNA bases or chemically modified nucleotides. The modifications do not abolish cellular activity, but rather impart increased stability and/or increased cellular potency. Examples of chemical modifications include phosphorothioate groups, 2′-deoxynucleotide, 2′-OCH3-containing ribonucleotides, 2′-F-ribonucleotides, 2′-methoxyethyl ribonucleotides, combinations thereof and the like. The siRNA can have varying lengths (e.g., 10-200 bps) and structures (e.g., hairpins, single/double strands, bulges, nicks/gaps, mismatches) and are processed in cells to provide active gene silencing. A double-stranded siRNA (dsRNA) can have the same number of nucleotides on each strand (blunt ends) or asymmetric ends (overhangs). The overhang of 1-2 nucleotides can be present on the sense and/or the antisense strand, as well as present on the 5′- and/or the 3′-ends of a given strand. Multivalent binding proteins are binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Multivalent binding proteins are engineered to have the three or more antigen binding sites and are generally not naturally occurring antibodies. The term “multispecific binding protein” means a binding protein capable of binding two or more related or unrelated targets. Dual variable domain (DVD) binding proteins are tetravalent or multivalent binding proteins binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Such DVDs may be monospecific (i.e., capable of binding one antigen) or multispecific (i.e., capable of binding two or more antigens). DVD binding proteins comprising two heavy chain DVD polypeptides and two light chain DVD polypeptides are referred to as DVD Ig's. Each half of a DVD Ig comprises a heavy chain DVD polypeptide, a light chain DVD polypeptide, and two antigen binding sites. Each binding site comprises a heavy chain variable domain and a light chain variable domain with a total of 6 CDRs involved in antigen binding per antigen binding site. Multispecific DVDs include DVD binding proteins that bind DLL4 and VEGF, or C-met and EFGR or ErbB3 and EGFR.
