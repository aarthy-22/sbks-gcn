Expression and selective inhibition of the constitutive and inducible forms of human cyclo-oxygenase.
The enzyme cyclo-oxygenase catalyses the oxygenation of arachidonic acid, leading to the formation of prostaglandins.
Recently two forms of cyclo-oxygenase have been described: a constitutive (COX-1) enzyme present in most cells and tissues, and an inducible (COX-2) isoenzyme observed in many cells in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines.
Constitutive and inducible forms of human cyclo-oxygenase (hCOX-1 and hCOX-2) were cloned and expressed in insect cells, utilizing a baculovirus expression system.
hCOX-1 had a specific activity of 18.8 mumol of O2/mg with a Km of 13.8 microM for arachidonate and Vmax.
of 1500 nmol of O2/nmol of enzyme, whereas hCOX-2 had a specific activity of 12.2 mumol of O2/mg with a Km of 8.7 microM for arachidonate and a Vmax. of 1090 nmol of O2/nmol of enzyme.
Indomethacin inhibited both hCOX-1 and hCOX-2, whereas NS-398 and Dup-697 selectively inhibited hCOX-2.
Both NS-398 and Dup-697 exhibited time-dependent inactivation of hCOX-2, as did indomethacin on both enzymes.
The competitive inhibitor of hCOX-1, mefenamic acid, also displayed competitive inhibition of hCOX-2.
These results demonstrate the ability to generate selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which could provide useful improvement therapeutically in the treatment of chronic inflammatory disease.
