Temporal relationship between aquaporin-4 and glial fibrillary acidic protein in cerebellum of neonate and adult rats administered a BBB disrupting spider venom.
Two astrocyte markers, the glial water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), have been implicated in several physiological and pathological conditions in the central nervous system (CNS) as well as in blood-brain barrier breakdown (BBBb).
By color segmentation the immunoreactivity of both proteins, we demonstrate that the expression of AQP4 and GFAP was increased in the cerebellum of neonate (14-day-old, P14) and adult (8-week-old) rats administered Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom (PNV) known to cause perivascular edema, BBBb and convulsion.
In the cerebellum's gray matter, PNV produced a major response, especially in the granular layer.
Parallel increases in AQP4 and GFAP expression occurred 24 h after envenomation in the white matter of P14 and in the molecular layer of adults, as well as in the granular layer 2 h after envenomation.
In the Purkinje layer there was a tendency of increased AQP4, for both, neonates (5 h), and adults (2 and 24 h).
Moreover, PNV also provoked nonparallel upregulation of both markers with prevalence of upregulation of AQP 4 for P14 rats, and GFAP for adults.
The major expression of both proteins was in the gray matter.
The data indicates a venom effect in water/electrolyte balance in the cerebellum and the participation of AQP4 in these effects.
Age-related and time-related regional differences probably reflect specificity in AQP4 distribution in different astrocytic membrane domains as well as its participation in K(+) buffering and neural activity.
This study is the first to associate astrocytic AQP4 expression and reactive gliosis in a model of BBB permeability promoted by P. nigriventer venom.
Our data provide compelling evidence that AQP4 expression was increased in the cerebellum of rats administered PNV.
