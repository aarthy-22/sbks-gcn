Identification of a new interaction mode between the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) and Csk-binding protein (Cbp)/phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid microdomains (PAG).
Proteins with Src homology 2 (SH2) domains play major roles in tyrosine kinase signaling.
Structures of many SH2 domains have been studied, and the regions involved in their interactions with ligands have been elucidated.
However, these analyses have been performed using short peptides comprising phosphotyrosine followed by a few amino acids, which are described as the canonical recognition sites.
Here we report the solution structure of the SH2 domain of C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) in complex with a longer phosphopeptide from Csk-binding protein (Cbp).
This structure, together with biochemical experiments, revealed the existence of a novel binding region in addition to the canonical phosphotyrosine-314 binding site of Cbp.
Mutational analysis of this second region in cells showed that both canonical and novel binding sites are required for tumor suppression through the Cbp-Csk interaction.
Furthermore, the data indicate an allosteric connection between Cbp binding and Csk activation that arises from residues in the βB/βC loop of the SH2 domain.
