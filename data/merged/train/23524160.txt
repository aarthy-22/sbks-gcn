Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel pyrrolidine-2,5-dione derivatives as potential antidepressant agents.
Part 1.
A series of 3-(1H-indol-3-yl)pyrrolidine-2,5-dione derivatives was synthesized and their biological activity was evaluated.
The chemical structures of the newly prepared compounds were confirmed by (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and ESI-HRMS spectra data.
All tested compounds proved to be potent 5-HT1A receptor and serotonin transporter protein (SERT) ligands.
Among them, compounds 15, 18, 19 and 30 showed significant affinity for 5-HT1A and SERT.
Computer docking simulations carried out for compounds 15, 31 and 32 to models of 5-HT1A receptor and SERT confirm the results of biological tests.
Due to high affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor and moderate affinity for SERT, compounds 31, 32, 35, and 37 were evaluated for their affinity for D2L, 5-HT6, 5-HT7 and 5-HT2A receptors.
In vivo tests, in turn, resulted in determining the functional activity of compounds 15, 18, 19 and 30 to the 5-HT1A receptor.
The results of these tests indicate that all of the ligands possess properties characteristic of 5-HT1A receptor agonists.
