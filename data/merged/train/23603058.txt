The Fusarium toxin deoxynivalenol (DON) modulates the LPS induced acute phase reaction in pigs.
The systemic effects of the Fusarium toxin deoxynivalenol (DON) and of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) were studied in male castrated pigs (40.4±3.7kg) infused intravenously with either DON or LPS alone (100μgDON/kg/h, 7.5μg/LPS/kg/h), or together (100μgDON plus 7.5μg/LPS/kg/h).
The Control group received a saline infusion (n=6/treatment, 24h observation period).
An additional DON infusion did not exacerbate the clinical signs observed in LPS-infused pigs.
For example, rectal temperature climaxed after 4h (40.4±0.2°C) and 5h (40.1±0.3°C), in the LPS and LPS+DON groups, respectively.
Saline and DON alone did not induce an acute phase reaction as indicated by unaltered plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) while LPS caused a significant rise of both cytokines.
TNF-alpha plasma peak concentrations were significantly higher in the LPS compared to the DON+LPS group (94.3±17.2ng/mL vs. 79.2±15.7ng/mL) while IL-6 climaxed earlier in the latter group (3h p.i.
vs. 2h p.i.).
From the tested clinical-chemical plasma characteristics the total bilirubin concentration and the ASAT activity were strongly elevated by the LPS infusion and additionally increased and decreased by DON, respectively.
In conclusion, the LPS-induced effects were only marginally modified by DON.
