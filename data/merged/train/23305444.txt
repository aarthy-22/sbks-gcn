Discovery and evaluation of novel inhibitors of mycobacterium protein tyrosine phosphatase B from the 6-Hydroxy-benzofuran-5-carboxylic acid scaffold.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) protein tyrosine phosphatase B (mPTPB) is a virulence factor secreted by the pathogen and mediates mycobacterial survival in macrophages by targeting host cell immune responses.
Consequently, mPTPB represents an exciting new target to combat tuberculosis (TB) infection.
We describe a medicinal chemistry oriented approach that transforms a benzofuran salicylic acid scaffold into a highly potent (IC(50) = 38 nM) and selective mPTPB inhibitor (>50 fold against a large panel of PTPs).
Importantly, the inhibitor is capable of reversing the altered host immune responses induced by the bacterial phosphatase and restoring the macrophage's full capacity to secrete IL-6 and undergo apoptosis in response to interferon-γ stimulation, validating the concept that chemical inhibition of mPTPB may be therapeutically useful for novel TB treatment.
The study further demonstrates that bicyclic salicylic acid pharmacophores can be used to deliver PTP inhibitors with high potency, selectivity, and cellular efficacy.
