Resveratrol enhances exercise training responses in rats selectively bred for high running performance.
High Capacity Runner (HCR) rats have been developed by divergent artificial selection for treadmill endurance running capacity to explore an aerobic biology-disease connection.
The beneficial effects of resveratrol supplementation have been demonstrated in endurance running and the antioxidant capacity of resveratrol is also demonstrated.
In this study we examine whether 12weeks of treadmill exercise training and/or resveratrol can enhance performance in HCR.
Indeed, resveratrol increased aerobic performance and strength of upper limbs of these rats.
Moreover, we have found that resveratrol activated the AMP-activated protein kinase, SIRT1, and mitochondrial transcription factor A (p<0.05).
The changes in mitochondrial fission/fusion and Lon protease/HSP78 levels suggest that exercise training does not significantly induce damage of proteins.
Moreover, neither exercise training nor resveratrol supplementation altered the content of protein carbonyls.
Changes in the levels of forkhead transcription factor 1 and SIRT4 could suggest increased fat utilization and improved insulin sensitivity.
These data indicate, that resveratrol supplementation enhances aerobic performance due to the activation of the AMPK-SIRT1-PGC-1α pathway.
