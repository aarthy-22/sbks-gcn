Fast, reversible, and general photomechanical motion in single crystals of various azo compounds using visible light.
Pseudostilbene-type single crystals exhibit ubiquitous, fast, and reversible photomechanical motion under visible-light irradiation.
Push-pull substituents impart extremely rapid switching using just one wavelength of light by shortening the lifetime of the cis-form.
This results in a bending motion in the microsecond regime.
The influence of crystal density, thickness, and molecular orientation on optimization of the photomechanical effect is investigated.
