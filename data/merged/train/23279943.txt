Potential prevention and treatment of maifanite for Alzheimer's disease based on behavior test, oxidative stress assay, and trace element analysis in hippocampus of Aβ(₂₅₋₃₅)-induced AD rats.
This study aimed to assess whether maifanite can improve the learning and memory, and antioxidant abilities of Alzheimer's disease (AD) rats.
The 70 rats were divided into seven groups: [A] normal control group, [B] AD model group, [C] sham group, [D] positive control group (donepezil), [E] low-dose maifanite group, [F] middle-dose maifanite group, [G] high-dose maifanite group.
For [B], [D], [E], [F], and [G] groups, Aβ(25-35) ventricle injection was carried out, then respective medicine were administered once a day for 60 consecutive days.
The step-down and step-through test were used to measure learning and memory ability.
The hippocampus levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were assayed.
The hippocampus contents of Al, Fe, Cu, Zn, Se, and Mn were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer.
Maifanite decreased the acquisition errors and the retention errors while prolonging the step-down latency, and decreased the number of electric shocks while prolonging the first latency of AD rats.
Aβ(25-35) ventricle injection initiated the decrease of SOD and GSH-Px activities and the increase of MDA content, and triggered the rise of Al, Fe, and Cu levels and the decline of Mn, Zn, and Se levels.
The SOD and GSH-Px activities were enhanced followed by reduced MDA level, and the levels of Mn, Zn, and Se increased accompanied by Al, Fe, and Cu decreased in the maifanite treat groups.
Maifanite could improve the learning and memory, and the antioxidant abilities of AD rats.
Maifanite had the potential prevention and treatment for AD.
