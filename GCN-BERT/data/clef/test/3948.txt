TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a transgenic plant exhibiting increased biomass per plant individual and improved environmental stress resistance, and a method for preparing the same. BACKGROUND ART It has been suggested that the circadian clock system in Arabidopsis thaliana is associated with increased biomass, determination of the time of flowering, and environmental stress responses (Non-Patent Document 1). As a result of research conducted using Arabidopsis thaliana, three plant clock-associated genes (i.e., the circadian clock-associated 1 (CCA1) gene, the late elongated hypocotyl (LHY) gene, and the timing of cab expression 1 (TOC1) gene) have been discovered, and the mechanisms of plant circadian rhythm have been proved to be based on the transcriptional feedback loop of such a plurality of genes. Among these, the TOC1 gene is one of pseudo-response regulator genes. At present, a total of 5 genes (i.e., PRR3, PRR5, PRR7, and PRR9, in addition to TOC1 (PRR1)) have been identified as pseudo-response regulator genes in Arabidopsis thaliana, and the expression levels thereof increase and decrease in the order of PRR9, PRR7, PRR5, PRR3, and PRR1 (TOC1) from dawn toward evening in a phase-graded manner. The present inventors had focused on and studied the prr9 prr7 prr5 triple mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana (i.e., the d975 mutant). As a result of previous studies, the d975 mutant was found to exhibit industrially useful phenotypes such as flowering stem elongation (Non-Patent Document 3), delayed flowering (Non-Patent Document 2), and higher resistance against low temperature or dehydration (Non-Patent Document 4), in addition to a breakdown of the circadian clock system (Non-Patent Document 2). However, since the three PRR genes complement their functions each other, a single mutant would not exhibit a remarkable phenotype (Non-Patent Document 2). In addition, conferring of a useful phenotype by deletion of the three PRR genes as targets would be attended with the difficulty in preparation of a multiple mutant. Further, since the biochemical functions of PRR9, PRR7, and PRR5 proteins are unknown, suppression of the functions of the PRR proteins with the use of a low-molecular-weight compound or the like is not practical technically. An example of a technique for conferring low temperature resistance or dehydration resistance is a method in which expression of the DREB1A gene or similar genes is induced under the control of a dehydration stress responsive promoter of Arabidopsis thaliana (Patent Document 1 and Non-Patent Document 5). While this method may be sufficient to confer stress resistance, increased biomass is not mentioned. Increased biomass is observed for a mutant of the clock-associated gene, GIGANTEA (gi) (Non-Patent Document 6); however, this mutant is more susceptible to low temperature stress (Non-Patent Document 7). Thus, a plant exhibiting increased biomass and environmental stress resistance cannot be prepared by a method of deleting the function of this gene as a target. Slightly decreased expression levels of the clock-associated genes (i.e., the circadian clock associated 1 (CCA1) gene and the late elongated hypocotyl (LHY)) are said to be correlated with the increased biomass (Non-Patent Document 8); however, a line in which expression of the CCA1 gene and the LHY gene was completely suppressed (i.e., the ccal lhy double mutant) rather exhibits a decreased biomass (Non-Patent Document 9). Thus, it is considered difficult to increase the biomass by targeting these genes. While the biological clocks of long-day plants are almost the same as those of short-day plants (Non-Patent Document 10), seasonal responses utilizing such biological clocks are known to differ from each other (Non-Patent Document 11). Accordingly, the degree of effectiveness of conferring a useful phenotype on a short-day plant by modifying a clock gene of a long-day plant (i.e., Arabidopsis thaliana) is unknown.

BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION Hereinafter, the present invention is described in detail. 1. Polynucleotide A polynucleotide used for preparing the transgenic plant of the present invention is a polynucleotide encoding a protein comprising a CCT motif and a pseudo-receiver domain which is a common motif of plant pseudo-response regulator genes or a fusion polynucleotide of said polynucleotide and a polynucleotide encoding at least one transcription activation domain of a transcription factor. Examples of the polynucleotide encoding a protein comprising a CCT motif and a pseudo-receiver domain include the PRR1 (TOC1), PRR3, PRR5, PRR7 and PRR9 genes, which are pseudo-response regulator genes. The PRR1 (TOC1), PRR3, PRR5, PRR7 and PRR9 genes have a common structure as shown in FIG. 1. SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 show the nucleotide sequences of the PRR1 (TOC1), PRR3, PRR5, PRR7 and PRR9 genes, and SEQ ID NOs: 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 show the amino acid sequences encoded by said nucleotide sequences. The pseudo-receiver domain is a motif that is found in common in pseudo-response regulator genes, and it is known to have an ability of protein-protein interaction. SEQ ID NOs: 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 show the amino acid sequences of the pseudo-receiver domains of the PRR1 (TOC1), PRR3, PRR5, PRR7 and PRR9 genes. Further, the CCT motif is a structure that is often observed in plant proteins, is rich in basic amino acids, and is composed of about 45 amino acids. The CCT motif of the CONSTANS (CO) protein of Arabidopsis thaliana is known to be involved in nuclear localization and protein-protein interaction. SEQ ID NOs: 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21 show the amino acid sequences of the CCT motifs of the PRR1 (TOC1), PRR3, PRR5, PRR7 and PRR9 genes. Polynucleotides encoding proteins comprising a CCT motif and a pseudo-receiver domain (hereinafter referred to as “PRR polynucleotides”) are considered to be widely distributed in the plant kingdom. Examples thereof include, but are not limited to, rice (Gramineae), poplar (Salicaceae), grape (Vitaceae), tomato (Solanaceae), cassava (Euphorbiaceae), soybean (Leguminosae), gymnosperms, ferns, and mosses, in addition to Arabidopsis thaliana (Brassicaceae). In the present invention, a polynucleotide consisting of a nucleotide sequence similar to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, 7 or 9 can be used as a PRR polynucleotide like a polynucleotide consisting of the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, 7 or 9, provided that it has a function equivalent to that of the polynucleotide consisting of the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, 7 or 9. Accordingly, a polynucleotide consisting of a nucleotide sequence similar to the nucleotide sequence shown in the above sequence identification number and encoding a protein having an activity of suppressing the transcription of the circadian clock-associated 1 (CCA1) gene or the late elongated hypocotyl (LHY) gene is encompassed by the PRR polynucleotide used in the present invention. Such a polynucleotide may be naturally occurring or artificially prepared. For example, a homolog of the nucleotide sequence shown in the above sequence identification number (including an ortholog and a paralog) or a sequence having an artificially introduced mutation may be used. Specific examples include the polynucleotides shown below: (i) a polynucleotide that hybridizes under stringent conditions to a polynucleotide consisting of a nucleotide sequence complementary to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, 7 or 9 and that encodes a protein having an activity of suppressing the transcription of the circadian clock-associated 1 (CCA1) gene or the late elongated hypocotyl (LHY) gene; (ii) a polynucleotide that consists of a nucleotide sequence having 70% or higher homology to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, 7 or 9 and that encodes a protein having an activity of suppressing the transcription of the circadian clock-associated 1 (CCA1) gene or the late elongated hypocotyl (LHY) gene; (iii) a polynucleotide encoding a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, 8 or 10; (iv) a polynucleotide consisting of an amino acid sequence derived from the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, 8 or 10 by deletion, substitution, or addition of one or several amino acids and encoding a protein having an activity of suppressing the transcription of the circadian clock-associated 1 (CCA1) gene or the late elongated hypocotyl (LHY) gene; and (v) a polynucleotide consisting of an amino acid sequence having 70% or higher homology to the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, 8 or 10 and encoding a protein having an activity of suppressing the transcription of the circadian clock-associated 1 (CCA1) gene or the late elongated hypocotyl (LHY) gene. The “circadian clock-associated 1 (CCA1) gene” is a morning gene that constitutes the circadian clock system and exhibits the maximum expression level in the morning. The term “activity of suppressing the transcription of the CCA1 gene” refers to an activity of suppressing the transcription of said gene and decreasing the expression level thereof. The “late elongated hypocotyl (LHY) gene” is a gene functionally homologous to the CCA1 gene. The term “stringent conditions” as used herein refers to the conditions under which so-called specific hybrids are formed but non-specific hybrids are not formed. A person skilled in the art can adequately select the stringent hybridization conditions by referring to Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 2001. For example, hybridization is carried out by performing pre-hybridization in a hybridization solution containing 25% formamide, or 50% formamide for more stringent conditions, 4×SSC, 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 10× Denhart's solution, and 20 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 42° C. overnight, adding a labeled probe thereto, and incubating the resultant at 42° C. overnight. In the subsequent step of washing, the washing solution and temperature conditions are approximately “1×SSC, 0.1% SDS, 37° C.,” approximately “0.5×SSC, 0.1% SDS, 42° C.” for more stringent conditions, and approximately “0.2×SSC, 0.1% SDS, 65° C.” for even more stringent conditions. The degree of stringency is increased as the temperature becomes higher and the salt concentration becomes lower. This enables isolation of more homologous polynucleotides. It should be noted that the combinations of SSC, SDS and temperature conditions described above are examples. A person skilled in the art can adequately combine the above or other factors that determine the hybridization stringency (e.g., probe concentration, probe length, and hybridization duration) to realize stringency similar to that described above. A polynucleotide obtained via hybridization carried out under the above stringent conditions usually has high homology to DNA represented by the nucleotide sequence shown in any of SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9. The term “high homology” as used herein refers to the sequence homology of 70% or higher, preferably 80% or higher, 85% or higher, more preferably 90% or higher, further preferably 95% or higher, and most preferably 97% or higher (e.g., 98% to 99%) to any of the nucleotide sequences shown in the above sequence identification numbers. In relation to the expression “amino acid sequence derived by deletion, substitution, or addition of one or several amino acids”, the number of amino acids that may be deleted, substituted or added is the number of amino acids that can be deleted, substituted or added in accordance with a known method for preparing mutant proteins, such as site-directed mutagenesis. The number is not limited as long as the aforementioned activity is maintained. Usually, the number is for example 1 to 20, preferably 1 to 10, and more preferably 1 to 5. The term “mutation” as used herein primarily means a mutation that is artificially introduced in accordance with a known method for preparing mutant proteins, although a naturally occurring similar mutation may be employed. The term “70% or higher homology” used in relation to the amino acid sequence refers to sequence homology of preferably 80% or higher, 85% or higher, more preferably 90% or higher, further preferably 95% or higher, and most preferably 97% or higher (e.g., 98% to 99%). Identity of sequence (amino acid sequence, nucleotide sequence) can be determined using the FASTA search or the BLAST search. The PRR polynucleotide used in the present invention can be prepared using a known technique. For example, total mRNA may be prepared from an Arabidopsis thaliana tissue extract, primers may be designed based on the nucleotide sequence shown in the above sequence identification number, and full-length cDNA of the nucleotide sequence shown in the above sequence identification number can be obtained by performing the RACE method or the like. Alternatively, a cDNA library may be prepared from an Arabidopsis thaliana tissue extract, a probe may be designed based on the nucleotide sequence shown in the above sequence identification number, and the PRR polynucleotide of interest can be obtained using the hybridization method. Further, the PRR polynucleotide may be artificially synthesized based on the nucleotide sequence shown in the above sequence identification number. A person skilled in the art can readily obtain a homologue of the PRR polynucleotide by referring to, for example, Molecular Cloning (Sambrook, J. et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual 3rd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 10 Skyline Drive Plainview, N.Y., 2001). For example, deletion, addition and substitution of an amino acid can be carried out by introducing a mutation into a gene encoding the above protein using a technique known in the art. Mutation can be introduced into a gene by a known technique such as the Kunkel method or the Gapped duplex method, or a method in accordance therewith. For example, a kit for introducing mutation that utilizes the site-directed mutagenesis method (e.g., Mutant-K (TAKARA) or Mutant-G (TAKARA)), or the kit of LA PCR in vitro Mutagenesis series (TAKARA)) can be used. Alternatively, a sequence having a mutation being introduced into the nucleotide sequence shown in the above sequence identification number may be synthesized using a commercially available nucleic acid synthesis apparatus. On the other hand, a polynucleotide encoding at least one transcription activation domain of a transcription factor which is to be fused to the PRR polynucleotide has a function of releasing the suppression of transcription of the circadian clock-associated 1 (CCA1) gene or the late elongated hypocotyl (LHY) gene due to the PRR polynucleotide and activating the transcription. Any transcription activation domain of a transcription factor may be used as long as it has the ability to activate the transcription. Specific examples include a transcription activation domain of the herpesvirus VP16 protein and a transcription activation domain of the yeast GAL4 protein. At least one transcription activation domain may be used, or two or more transcription activation domains of the same type or different types may be used in combination. A polynucleotide encoding the transcription activation domain of the herpesvirus VP16 protein is shown in SEQ ID NO: 11. A polynucleotide consisting of a nucleotide sequence similar to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 11 may be used, provided that it has a function of releasing the suppression of transcription of the circadian clock-associated 1 (CCA1) gene or the late elongated hypocotyl (LHY) gene and activating the transcription upon fusion thereof to a PRR polynucleotide. Examples thereof include: a polynucleotide hybridizing under stringent conditions to a polynucleotide consisting of a nucleotide sequence complementary to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 11 and encoding a protein having an activity of releasing the suppression of transcription of the circadian clock-associated 1 (CCA1) gene or the late elongated hypocotyl (LHY) gene upon fusion thereof to a PRR polynucleotide; and a polynucleotide consisting of a nucleotide sequence having 70% or higher homology to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 11 and encoding a protein having an activity of releasing the suppression of transcription of the circadian clock-associated 1 (CCA1) gene or the late elongated hypocotyl (LHY) gene upon fusion thereof to a PRR polynucleotide. The meanings of “stringent” and “homology” are as defined above. 2. Recombinant Vector The recombinant vector of the present invention used for plant transformation can be constructed by incorporating the above polynucleotide or fusion polynucleotide (hereinafter referred to as “target gene”) into an adequate vector. Examples of vectors that can be preferably used include pBI, pPZP, pSMA, and pCAMBIA vectors which can introduce the target gene into a plant via Agrobacterium. Use of pBI binary vectors or intermediate vectors is particularly preferable, and examples thereof include pBI121, pBI101, pBI101.2, and pBI101.3. The term “binary vector” refers to a shuttle vector replicable in Escherichia coli and Agrobacterium. When a plant is infected with Agrobacterium that harbors a binary vector, DNA located in a region defined by the border sequences (LB sequence and RB sequence) on the vector can be integrated into plant nuclear DNA. On the other hand, pUC vectors are capable of directly introducing a gene into a plant, and examples thereof include pUC18, pUC19 and pUC9. Further, plant virus vectors, such as cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV), bean golden mosaic virus (BGMV), and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) vectors, can also be used. When a binary vector plasmid is used, a target gene is inserted into a site between border sequences (LB and RB sequences) of the binary vector, and the recombinant vector is amplified in Escherichia coli. Subsequently, the amplified recombinant vector is introduced into, for example, Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101, C58, LBA4404, EHA101 or EHA105, or Agrobacterium rhizogenes LBA1334, by the electroporation method or the like, and the Agrobacterium is used for plant transduction. In addition to the above-mentioned method, the three-member conjugation method (Nucleic Acids Research, 12: 8711, 1984) can be used to prepare Agrobacterium containing a target gene to be used for plant infection. Specifically, Escherichia coli harboring a plasmid comprising a target gene, Escherichia coli harboring a helper plasmid (e.g., pRK2013), and Agrobacterium are subjected to mixed culture on a medium containing rifampicin and kanamycin. Then, a conjugate Agrobacterium to be used for plant infection can be obtained. For inserting a target gene into a vector, one may employ a method in which purified DNA is first cleaved with an adequate restriction enzyme and the cleaved fragment is then inserted into a restriction enzyme site or multicloning site of adequate vector DNA to connect the fragment to the vector. In addition, it is necessary that a target gene be incorporated into a vector in such a manner that the gene is able to exert its functions. Thus, a promoter, an enhancer, a terminator, a replication origin that allows the use of a binary vector (e.g., a replication origin derived from Ti or Ri plasmid), a selection marker gene, and the like can be connected to a site upstream, inside, or downstream of the target gene in the vector. A “promoter” may not be derived from a plant, provided that it is DNA that can function in a plant cell and bring about expression in a given tissue or at a given growth stage of a plant. Specific examples include cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter, nopaline synthase gene promoter (Pnos), maize-derived ubiquitin promoter, rice-derived actin promoter, and tobacco-derived PR protein promoter. When a target gene is to be expressed specifically in a given organ, a promoter that is expressed in a tissue-specific manner can be used. For example, the biomass-increasing effect of the polynucleotide of the present invention can be efficiently attained by using a flowering stem-specific gene or shoot apex-specific gene promoter. An enhancer is used, for example, for increasing the expression efficiency of a target gene. Examples thereof include an enhancer region that comprises an upstream sequence in the CaMV 35S promoter. Any sequence may be used as a terminator, provided that it can terminate transcription of a gene transcribed by a promoter. Examples thereof include terminators of the nopaline synthase (NOS) gene, the octopine synthase (OCS) gene, and the CaMV 35S RNA gene. Examples of selection marker genes include ampicillin-resistant gene, neomycin-resistant gene, hygromycin-resistant gene, bialaphos-resistant gene, and dihydrofolate reductase gene. The selection marker gene may be connected to a single plasmid together with a target gene as described above to prepare a recombinant vector. Alternatively, a recombinant vector obtained by connecting the selection marker gene to a plasmid and a recombinant vector obtained by connecting a target gene may be separately prepared. When the vectors are separately prepared, the vectors are co-transfected (co-introduced) into a host. 3. Transgenic Plant and Method for Preparing the Same The transgenic plant of the present invention can be prepared by introducing a polynucleotide, a fusion polynucleotide, or a recombinant vector as described above (hereinafter collectively referred to as “target gene”) into a target plant. In the present invention, the term “introduction of a gene” means that a target gene is introduced into cells of a host plant in a manner that allows the gene to express using, for example, a known genetic engineering technique. The introduced gene may be integrated into the genomic DNA of a host plant or may be present being comprised in a foreign vector. As a method for introducing the target gene into a plant as described above, one of a variety of methods that have been reported and established can be adequately utilized. Examples thereof include the Agrobacterium method, the PEG-calcium phosphate method, the electroporation method, the liposome method, the particle gun method, and the microinjection method. When the Agrobacterium method is employed, a protoplast, a tissue section, or a plant body as it is (i.e., the in planta method) may be used. When a protoplast is used, the introduction can be carried out using a method in which the protoplast is co-cultured with Agrobacterium harboring a Ti plasmid or an Ri plasmid (for Agrobacterium tumefaciens or Agrobacterium rhizogenes, respectively), or the protoplast is fused to Agrobacterium which has been converted to a spheroplast (the spheroplast method). When a tissue section is used, the introduction can be carried out using a method in which an aseptically cultured leaf disc of a target plant is infected, or a callus (cultured undifferentiated cell) is infected. When the in planta method using a seed or a plant body is employed (i.e., in a system that does not involve tissue culture with the addition of plant hormones), the introduction can be carried out by direct treatment of an imbibed seed, a young seedling, a potted plant, or the like with Agrobacterium. These plant transformation methods can be carried out in accordance with the descriptions of general textbooks such as “Shinban, Model shokubutsu no jikken protocol, Idengakuteki shuhou kara genome kaiseki made (New edition, Experimental protocols for model plants, From genetic engineering technique to genome analysis), 2001, supervised by Isao Shimamoto & Kiyotaka Okada, Shujunsha.” One can confirm whether or not a target gene has been incorporated into a plant using the PCR method, the Southern hybridization method, the Northern hybridization method, the Western blotting method or the like. For example, DNA is prepared from a transgenic plant, primers specific for the target gene are designed, and PCR is then carried out. After PCR has been carried out, the amplification product is subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, capillary electrophoresis or the like, and stained with ethidium bromide, a SYBR Green solution or the like, Transformation can be confirmed based on detection of the amplification product as a single band. Alternatively, the amplification product can be detected by carrying out PCR with the use of primers that have been labeled with a fluorescent dye or the like beforehand. Further, one may use a method in which the amplification product is bound to a solid phase such as a microplate, and confirmed using fluorescence, an enzymatic reaction or the like. Further, one may confirm that a target gene introduced into a plant cell is expressed (that is, the plant is transformed) by extracting proteins from the plant cell, fractionating the proteins by two-dimensional electrophoresis, and detecting a band of the protein encoded by the target gene. Alternatively, a vector in which one of a variety of reporter genes (e.g., a gene for β-glucuronidase (GUS), luciferase (LUC), green fluorescent protein (GFP), chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) or β-galactosidase (LacZ)) is connected downstream of a target gene is prepared. Agrobacterium into which the aforementioned vector has been introduced is used to transform a plant in a manner similar to that as described above. Then, the expression of the reporter gene is measured. Thereby, transformation of the plant can be confirmed. The plant used for transformation in the present invention may be a monocotyledonous plant or a dicotyledonous plant, or a short-day plant or a long-day plant. In case of a short-day plant (e.g., rice, maize, soybean, chrysanthemum, morning glory, or cosmos), transformation is carried out by introducing a polynucleotide encoding a protein comprising a CCT motif and a pseudo-receiver domain which is a common motif of plant pseudo-response regulator genes as described above. In case of a long-day plant (e.g., Arabidopsis thaliana, wheat, barley, spinach, or poplar), transformation is carried out by introducing a fusion polynucleotide of said polynucleotide and a polynucleotide encoding at least one transcription activation domain of a transcription factor. Examples of plants used for transformation in the present invention include, but are not limited to, plants belonging to Brassicaceae (e.g., Arabidopsis thaliana, cabbage, rapeseed), Gramineae (e.g., rice, maize, barley, wheat, switchgrass, sugar cane, sorghum), Solanaceae (e.g., tomato, eggplant, potato, tobacco), Leguminosae (e.g., soybean, garden pea, bush bean), Convolvulaceae (e.g., sweet potato), Compositae (e.g., sunflower), Euphorbiaceae (e.g., cassava, Jatropha), Rosaceae (e.g., strawberry), and Salix (e.g., poplar). Terrestrial plants, including gymnosperms, ferns, and mosses, can also be generally used. Examples of plant materials to be subjected to transformation in the present invention include: plant organs such as stems, leaves, seeds, embryos, ovules, ovaries and shoot apices; plant tissues such as anthers and pollens, and the sections thereof; undifferentiated calluses; and cultured plant cells such as protoplasts which are prepared by removing cell walls from the above by enzyme treatment. When the in planta method is employed, an imbibed seed or a whole plant body can be utilized. According to the present invention, the term “transgenic plant” means any one of a whole plant body, a plant organ (e.g., leaf, petal, stem, root, grain or seed), a plant tissue (e.g., epidermis, phloem, parenchyma, xylem, or vascular bundle), or a cultured plant cell (e.g., callus). When a cultured plant cell is to be used, an organ or an individual may be regenerated according to a known tissue culture method in order to regenerate a transformant from a resulting transformed cell. A person skilled in the art can readily carry out such a procedure using a method that is commonly known as a method of regenerating a plant body from a plant cell. For example, a plant body can be regenerated from a plant cell in the following manner. At the outset, when a plant tissue or a protoplast is used as a plant material to be subjected to transformation, it is cultured in a medium for callus formation that has been sterilized after adding, for example, inorganic elements, vitamins, carbon sources, saccharides as energy sources or plant growth regulators (plant hormones, such as auxin, cytokinin, gibberellin, abscisic acid, ethylene, or brassinosteroid) to form a dedifferentiated callus which proliferates in an unstructured manner (hereinafter, this process is referred to as “callus induction”). The thus formed callus is transferred to a fresh medium containing plant growth regulators such as auxin, and then further proliferated (or subcultured). Callus induction is carried out on a solid medium such as agar, and subculture is carried out, for example, in a liquid medium. Thereby, the cultivation can be carried out efficiently and in large quantities in the respective cases. Subsequently, the callus proliferated by the aforementioned subculture is cultured under adequate conditions to induce redifferentiation of an organ (hereinafter referred to as “induction of redifferentiation”), and a complete plant body is regenerated in the end. The induction of redifferentiation can be carried out by adequately setting the types and quantities of respective ingredients such as plant growth regulators (e.g., auxin) and carbon sources in the medium, light, temperature and the like. Such induction of redifferentiation results in formation of adventitious embryo, adventitious root, adventitious bud, adventitious shoot and the like, which further leads to growth into a complete plant body. Alternatively, storage may be conducted in a state prior to the formation of a complete plant body (e.g., encapsulated artificial seed, dry embryo, or freeze-dried cell or tissue). The transgenic plants of the present invention also include plant bodies of progenies obtained by sexual or asexual reproduction of plant bodies having a gene of interest being introduced (including plant bodies regenerated from transformed cells or calluses), and portions of tissues or organs of the progeny plants (seeds, protoplasts, and the like). The transgenic plant of the present invention can be produced in large quantities by obtaining a reproductive material such as a seed or a protoplast, from a plant body transformed by introduction of the target gene, and then cultivating or culturing the same. The transgenic plant obtained as described above exhibits increased biomass per plant as a result of expression of the fusion polynucleotide. In the present invention, the term “biomass” refers to the amount of a plant body or a part thereof existing within an arbitrary space at a given time. The term is used to encompass substances, foods, materials, fuels, resources and the like derived from said plant or parts thereof. Specifically, increased biomass refers to hypertrophy of a subterranean stem (rhizom, corm, tuber, bulb), a terrestrial stem, a flowering stem or a vine, hypertrophy of a seed, acceleration of elongation of stem length, plant length, culm length or ear length, or enlargement of a source organ such as a leaf. The transgenic plant obtained as described above also has environmental stress resistance. The term “environmental stress” generally means non-biological stress, such as dehydration stress, low temperature stress, high salt concentration stress or the like. The term “dehydration” means a state of water deprivation. The term “low temperature” refers to a state in which an organism species is exposed to a temperature lower than the optimal temperature for the life of the organism species (e.g., in case of Arabidopsis thaliana, it is exposed to a temperature of −20° C. to +21° C. for 1 hour to several weeks continuously). The term “high salt concentration” means a state in which treatment with NaCl at a concentration of 50 mM to 600 mM is carried out for 0.5 hour to several weeks continuously. A single type or a plurality of types of such environmental stresses may be applied. Hereinafter, the present invention is described in greater detail with reference to the examples below, although the technical scope of the present invention is not limited to these examples. Example 1 Construction of pBS-35S::PRR9-FLAG pBS-35S::PRR7-FLAG, and pBS-35S::PRR5-FLAG and Assay of Transcription Activation Function With the use of a vector prepared by incorporating the cauliflower mosaic virus-derived 35S transcription promoter, the FLAG peptide and the Nos transcription terminator into pBlueScript (Stratagene) (this vector is referred to as “pBS-35S::FLAG”) (Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem., 68 (9): 1966, 2004), vectors (pBS-35S::PRR9-FLAG, pBS-35S::PRR7-FLAG and pBS-35S::PRR5-FLAG) capable of expressing, under the control of the 35S transcription promoter, fusion proteins in which PRR9 (TAIR locus: At2g46790, SEQ ID NO: 9), PRR7 (TAIR locus: At5g02810, SEQ ID NO: 7) or PRR5 (TAIR locus: At5g24479, SEQ ID NO: 5) of Arabidopsis thaliana is connected in tandem to the FLAG peptide (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys: SEQ ID NO: 22) were constructed in the following manner. The PRR5 gene reaches its peak expression 6 hours after dawn. Accordingly, Arabidopsis thaliana was subjected to sampling and freezing at the time to prepare mRNA and cDNA therefrom. RNA was extracted from a plant using the RNeasy Plant Minikit (Qiagen). cDNA synthesis by a reverse transcription reaction was carried out using SuperScript II (Invitrogen) and oligo dT20 as a primer. PRR5 cDNA was amplified by PCR using the resulting cDNA pool as a template and primers (5′-ACACTCTAGAATGACTAGTAGCGAGGAAGTAG-3′: SEQ ID NO: 23 and 5′-GTTGGATCCTCTGGAGCTTGTGTGGATTGG-3′: SEQ ID NO: 24). PCR was carried out using PrimeStar enzyme by allowing the mixture to stand at 94° C. for 2 minutes, and repeating a cycle of 94° C. for 15 seconds, 55° C. for 20 seconds, and 72° C. for 2 minutes 35 times. The amplified PRR5 cDNA fragment was treated with restriction enzymes XbaI (Takara) and BamHI (Takara) at 37° C. for 5 hours. pBS-35S::FLAG was also treated with XbaI and BamHI. PRR5 cDNA and pBS-35S::FLAG which had been treated with the restriction enzymes were connected to each other by a ligation reaction, the resultant was used to transform Escherichia coli DH5a (Takara), and a vector (pBS-35S::PRR5-FLAG) was recovered from a transformant. pBS-35S::PRR7-FLAG and pBS-35S::PRR9-FLAG were prepared in a similar manner. mRNA used for cloning was obtained from Arabidopsis thaliana 3 hours after dawn, PRR7 cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers (5′-CTTATCTAGAATGAATGCTAATGAGGAGGG-3′: SEQ ID NO: 25 and 5′-GAGTCCATGGTGCTATCCTCAATGTTTTTTATGTC-3′: SEQ ID NO: 26), and PRR9 cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers (5′-CAAATCTAGAATGGGGGAGATTGTGG-3′: SEQ ID NO: 27 and 5′-GAAGTCCATGGTTGATTTTGTAGACGCGTCTG-3′: SEQ ID NO: 28). The amplified PRR7 cDNA and PRR9 cDNA fragments were treated with restriction enzymes XbaI (Takara) and NcoI (Takara) at 37° C. for 5 hours. pBS-35S::FLAG was also treated with XbaI and NcoI. The PRR9 cDNA or PRR7 cDNA fragment and pBS-35S::FLAG which had been treated with the restriction enzymes were connected to each other by ligation reactions, the resultants were used to transform Escherichia coli DH5a (Takara), and vectors (pBS-35S::PRR9-FLAG and pBS-35S::PRR7-FLAG) were recovered from transformants. A transient expression system in Arabidopsis thaliana was used to observe how the PRR9, PRR7 and PRR5 proteins regulate the CCA1 promoter. The pBS-35S::PRR9-FLAG, pBS-35S::PRR7-FLAG or pBS-35S::PRR5-FLAG vector (effector vector), the CCA1::LUC vector that expresses the luciferase gene under the control of the CCA1 promoter (reporter vector), and the 35S::RLUC vector that expresses Renilla luciferase under the control of the 35S promoter (reference vector) were mixed with each other in amounts of 0.8 μg, and gold particles (diameters: 1 μM) were coated therewith. With the use of particle bombardment (GE Healthcare), the resultants were transiently introduced into Arabidopsis thaliana plants that had been grown with 12 hours in the light (white light) and 12 hours in the dark for 2 weeks after germination. Luciferase activity and Renilla luciferase activity were measured at a given time 12 hours or more after the introduction (2 hours after the beginning of the light period) in accordance with the method of Yamaguchi et al. (The Plant Journal, 55: 652, 2008), and the luciferase activity/Renilla luciferase activity (the value for the control experiment is defined as 1) was evaluated as indicating CCA1 promoter activity. As a result, the introduction of the PRR9-FLAG, PRR7-FLAG and PRR5-FLAG proteins was found to suppress the CCA1 promoter more than the introduction of the FLAG protein (control) (FIG. 2). Since PRR9, PRR7 and PRR5 proteins physically interact with the CCA1 promoter in a plant body (The Plant Cell, vol. 22, 594-605, 2010), the PRR9, PRR7 and PRR5 proteins are considered to function as transcription repressors for the CCA1 promoter. Example 2 Preparation of PRR5-VP32, PRR9-VP32, PRR7-VP32, PRR3-VP32 and PRR1-VP32 and Assay of Transcription Activation Function With the use of a vector prepared by incorporating a cauliflower mosaic virus-derived 35S transcription promoter and a Nos transcription terminator into pBlueScript (Stratagene) (this vector is referred to as “pBS-35S”) (Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem., 68 (9): 1966, 2004), a vector (pBS-35S::PRR5-VP32) capable of expressing, under the control of the 35S transcription promoter, a fusion protein in which PRR5 of Arabidopsis thaliana (TAIR locus: At5g24479, SEQ ID NO: 5) is connected in tandem to the VP16 transcription activation domain of a herpesvirus-derived transcription factor (the nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID NO: 11) encoding an amino acid sequence corresponding to positions 413 to 490 of the amino acid sequence GeneBank: ACM62271) was constructed in the following manner. VP16 cDNA was amplified by PCR using pVP16 (Clontech) as a template and primers A (5′-GTTTACCATGGTGAAAGTCGCCCCCCCG-3′: SEQ ID NO: 29 and 5′-CTTTAAGCTTCGGGAATTCCCCACCGTACTCGTC-3′: SEQ ID NO: 30) or primers B (5′-CTTTAAGCTTAAAGTCGCCCCCCCG-3′: SEQ ID NO: 31 and 5′-CGAGAAAGCGGCCGCTTACGGGAATTCCCCACCGTACTCGTC-3′: SEQ ID NO: 32). The former VP16 cDNA is referred to as “VP16-1” and the latter is referred to as “VP16-2” for convenience. The reaction was carried out using PrimeStar enzyme (Takara) by allowing the mixture to stand at 94° C. for 2 minutes, and repeating a cycle of 94° C. for 15 seconds, 55° C. for 20 seconds, and 72° C. for 30 seconds 35 times. The amplified VP16-1 was treated with restriction enzymes NcoI (Takara) and HindIII (Takara) and the amplified VP16-2 was treated with HindIII and NotI (Takara) at 37° C. for 5 hours. Further, pBS-35S was treated with NcoI and NotI at 37° C. for 5 hours. VP16-1, VP16-2, and pBS-35S which had been treated with the restriction enzymes were connected to each other by a ligation reaction. The ligation reaction was carried out using Ligation High ver2 (Takara) in accordance with the attached instructions. The DNA solution subjected to ligation was used to transform Escherichia coli DH5a by the heat shock method. The transformed DH5a was selected on Luria-Bertani agar medium containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml). The resulting transformant was cultured in Luria-Bertani liquid medium containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml), and a vector was then recovered therefrom (this vector is referred to as “pBS-35S::VP32”). The PRR5 gene reaches its peak expression 6 hours after dawn. Accordingly, Arabidopsis thaliana was subjected to sampling and freezing at the time to prepare mRNA and cDNA therefrom. RNA was extracted from a plant using the RNeasy Plant Minikit (Qiagen). cDNA synthesis by a reverse transcription reaction was carried out using SuperScript II (Invitrogen) and oligo dT20 as a primer. PRR5 cDNA was amplified by PCR using the resulting cDNA pool as a template and primers (5′-ACACTCTAGAATGACTAGTAGCGAGGAAGTAG-3′: SEQ ID NO: 23 and 5′-GTTGGATCCTCTGGAGCTTGTGTGGATTGG-3′: SEQ ID NO: 24). PCR was carried out using PrimeStar enzyme by allowing the mixture to stand at 94° C. for 2 minutes, and repeating a cycle of 94° C. for 15 seconds, 55° C. for 20 seconds, and 72° C. for 2 minutes 35 times. The amplified PRR5 cDNA fragment was treated with restriction enzymes XbaI (Takara) and BamHI (Takara) at 37° C. for 5 hours. pBS-35S::VP32 was also treated with XbaI and BamHI. PRR5 cDNA and pBS-35S::VP32 which had been treated with the restriction enzymes were connected to each other by a ligation reaction, the resultant was used to transform Escherichia coli DH5a (Takara), and a vector (pBS-35S::PRR5-VP32, FIG. 3) was recovered from a transformant. Subsequently, a transient expression system in Arabidopsis thaliana was used to observe how the PRR5-VP32 protein regulates the CCA1 promoter. The pBS-35S::PRR5-VP32 vector (effector vector), the CCA1min-35S::LUC vector that expresses the luciferase gene under the control of the CCA1 promoter (reporter vector) [prepared by amplifying a region from −406 nt to −299 nt of the CCA1 promoter (where “0nt” represents the translation initiation site) with the use of the primers 5′-ACGCCAAGCTAAGCTTCTAGTATGTTGACATATGGC-3′(SEQ ID NO: 35) and 5′-GAAGGGTCTTGCGATATCGCTACGGAAATGGAGAAATC-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 36) to obtain CCA1min, and subjecting CCA1min to the In-Fusion reaction (Takara) to clone the same into HindIII and EcoRV restriction enzyme sites located upstream of the CaMV 35S promoter minimal region], and the 35S::RLUC vector (reference vector) that expresses Renilla luciferase under the control of the 35S promoter were mixed with each other in amounts of 0.8 μg, and gold particles (diameters: 1 μM) were coated therewith. With the use of particle bombardment (GE Healthcare), the resultants were transiently introduced into Arabidopsis thaliana plants that had been grown with 12 hours in the light (white light) and 12 hours in the dark for 2 weeks after germination. Luciferase activity and Renilla luciferase activity were measured at a given time 12 hours or more after the introduction (2 hours after the beginning of the light period) in accordance with the method of Yamaguchi et al. (The Plant Journal, 55: 652, 2008), and the luciferase activity/Renilla luciferase activity was evaluated as indicating CCA1 promoter activity. As a result, the introduction of the PRR5-VP32 protein was found to activate the CCA1 promoter more effectively than the introduction of the VP32 protein (FIG. 4). Since the PRR5 protein physically interacts with the CCA1 promoter in a plant body (The Plant Cell, vol. 22, 594-605, 2010), the PRR5-VP32 protein is considered to function as a transcription activator for the CCA1 promoter. There are four genes homologous to the PRR5 gene in Arabidopsis thaliana (PRR9, PRR7, PRR3, and TOC1). Accordingly, whether or not a fusion of VP32 and a protein encoded by one of the genes (PRR-VP32)) would also be capable of activating the CCA1 promoter as in the case of PRR5-VP32 was examined. PRR9 was amplified by PCR with the use of primers (5′-CACCATGGGGGAGATTGTGGTTTTAAG-3′: SEQ ID NO: 37 and 5′-TGATTTTGTAGACGCGTCTG-3′: SEQ ID NO: 38), and the resultant was TOPO-cloned into the pENTR-DTOPO vector (Invitrogen) (vector name: pENTR-DTOPO-PRR9). PRR7 was amplified by PCR with the use of primers (5′-CACCATGAATGCTAATGAGGAGGG-3′: SEQ ID NO: 39 and 5′-GCTATCCTCAATGTTTTTTATGTC-3′: SEQ ID NO: 40), and the resultant was cloned into pENTR-DTOPO (vector name: pENTR-DTOPO-PRR7). PRR3 was amplified by PCR with the use of primers (5′-CACCATGTGTTTTAATAACATTGAAACTGGTGATG-3′: SEQ ID NO: 41 and 5′-ATTGTCTTCACTTCCTGATTTATGATC-3′: SEQ ID NO: 42), and the resultant was cloned into pENTR-DTOPO (vector name: pENTR-DTOPO-PRR3). TOC1 was amplified by PCR with the use of primers (5′-CACCATGGATTTGAACGGTGAGTG-3′: SEQ ID NO: 43 and 5′-AGTTCCCAAAGCATCATCC-3′: SEQ ID NO: 44), and the resultant was cloned into pENTR-DTOPO (vector name: pENTR-DTOPO-TOC1). On the other hand, pBS-35S::PRR5-VP32 was digested with XbaI and BamHI, the PRR5 sequence was removed by gel electrophoresis, and the vector portion (pBS-35S::VP32) was blunt-ended with T4 polymerase (Takara). The Reading Frame Cassette B DNA fragment was incorporated by a ligation reaction between the blunt ends with the use of the Gateway Vector Conversion System (pBS-35S::VP32-GW). With the use of LR reaction kit (Invitrogen), the PRR gene sequences were cloned from the respective pENTR-DTOPO-PRRs prepared as described above into pBS-35S::VP32-GW (pBS-35S::PRR-VP32). The resultants were used as effector vectors to assay the CCA1 promoter activities using the Arabidopsis thaliana transient expression system. As a result, transient overexpression of PRR9-VP32, PRR7-VP32, and TOC1-VP32 was found to be able to activate the CCA1 promoter (FIG. 4). Example 3 Acquisition of Arabidopsis thaliana that Expresses PRR5-VP32 The pBS-35S::PRR5-VP32 vector DNA was treated with XbaI and NotI at 37° C. for 5 hours and the resultant was electrophoresed on agarose gel. The PRR5-VP32 fragment in the gel was visualized under UV light by EtBr staining, and a gel containing the fragment was excised using a razor. DNA was purified from the gel using NucleoSpin (Macherey-Nagel). The PRR5-VP32 fragment was cloned between the XbaI and NotI restriction enzyme sites of the pSK1 binary vector (DNA Res. 6: 407, 1999), and the resulting vector (pSK1-35S::PRR5-VP32) was used to transform Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA105 by the heat shock method. Transformants were selected on Luria-Bertani agar medium containing rifampicin (25 μg/ml) and kanamycin (25 μg/ml). The resulting transformed EHA105 was cultured in Luria-Bertani liquid medium containing rifampicin (25 μg/ml) and kanamycin (25 μg/ml) at 30° C. for 24 hours and used to infect Arabidopsis thaliana. Infection was carried out by the vacuum infiltration method (CR Acad. Sci. Paris, Life Science, 316: 1194, 1993). Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown in soil composed of a 1:1 mixture of vermiculite and culture soil, and inflorescences was directly dipped in the culture of EHA105 harboring pSK1-35S::PRR5-VP32. The resultant was placed in a desiccator, suctioned to 60 to 70 mmHg with the use of a vacuum pump, and then allowed to stand for 10 minutes at room temperature. The pot was transferred to a tray and covered with a plastic wrap to preserve the moisture. The wrap was removed on the following day, the plants were allowed to grow, and seeds were collected. The seeds were sowed on Murashige-Skoog agar medium containing 25 μg/ml of hygromycin, and plant individuals capable of growing were obtained as transgenic plants. Among the obtained plants, plants for which overexpression of PRR5-VP32 mRNA was observed were selected. mRNA was quantified in the following manner. RNA was extracted from a plant using the RNeasy Plant Minikit. cDNA synthesis by a reverse transcription reaction was carried out using SuperScript II. Quantitative PCR was carried out using SYBR Green Extaq II (Takara) as a reaction mixture and the primers (5′-CTTCATCCTTCTAGTGCC-3′: SEQ ID NO: 33 and 5′-GTCGTTTCTTCTTGGAGC-3′: SEQ ID NO: 34). PCR products were detected and quantified using the ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system (ABI). The selected PRR5-VP32-expressing recombinants were allowed to self-pollinate, and plants homozygously comprising the recombinant DNA site were further selected. Selection was carried out using, as an indicator, growth of the plant on Murashige-Skoog agar medium containing 25 μg/ml of hygromycin. Example 4 Biomass of Arabidopsis thaliana that Expresses PRR5-VP32 The homozygous Arabidopsis thaliana plants harboring 35S::PRR5-VP32, prr9 prr7 prr5 triple mutants, and wild-type plants were allowed to grow on rock wool using a ½ diluted MGRL hydroponic solution (Plant Physiol., 99: 263, 1992) with 16 hours in the light and 8 hours in the dark. While floral bud formation of the plants expressing 35S::PRR5-VP32 delayed a little and the number of leaves at the time of floral bud formation was increased as compared with that of wild-type plants, the degrees of the delay and the increase were not so great as the cases of the prr9 prr7 prr5 triple mutants (FIG. 5). The fact that floral bud formation is not greatly delayed means that plant maturation would not be delayed. Accordingly, it can be said that the phenotypes are advantageous for acquisition of biomaterials. Further, the homozygous Arabidopsis thaliana plants harboring 35S::PRR5-VP32 and wild-type plants were allowed to grow on rock wool using a ½ diluted MGRL hydroponic solution (Plant Physiol., 99: 263, 1992) with 16 hours in the light and 8 hours in the dark. The plant bodies were photographed when the flowering stem lengths reached 8 cm (i.e., at the same growth stage). When the total leaf area per individual was measured using Image J (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/), the leaf area of plant bodies expressing 35S::PRR5-VP32 was found to be about twice as large as that of wild-type plants (FIG. 6). Also, when the total leaf area per individual was measured using Image J 38 days after germination (i.e., after the same growth period in days), the leaf area of the plant body expressing PRR5-VP32 was found to be 1.7 to 1.8 times as large as that of wild-type plants (FIG. 7). Further, when the flowering stems reached a height of approximately 20 cm, the flowering stems were cut with a razor at a position between the axillary buds closest and second closest to the ground, the flowering stems were soaked in a staining solution (0.5% alcian blue and 1.0% safranin) for 5 minutes, and decolored with water, and the resulting cross sections were observed under a microscope (FIG. 8). As a result of the measurement of cross section areas of flowering stems using Image J, the cross sectional area of the flowering stem of the plant body expressing PRR5-VP32 was found to have increased by 4-fold or more as compared with the area of wild-type plant. It is suggested that the above is caused by the increased number of cells that form flowering stems and the increased shoot apex meristems that constitute flowering stems. Such phenotypes were also observed in independent transformants (i.e., lines having different recombinant DNA sites on chromosomes). Example 5 Environmental Stress Resistance of Arabidopsis thaliana that Expresses PRR5-VP32 (1) Salt Stress Resistance of Plant that Expresses PRR5-VP32 The homozygous Arabidopsis thaliana plants harboring 35S::PRR5-VP32 and wild-type plants were allowed to grow on MS medium with 16 hours in the light and 8 hours in the dark for 6 days and then transferred to salt stress medium. Normal MS medium or MS medium containing 0.2M NaCl was used. The plant bodies were photographed 5 days after the transfer. While the leaves of wild-type plants became white, plants expressing 35S::PRR5-VP32 remained green. This indicates that plants expressing 35S::PRR5-VP32 have higher salt resistance than wild-type plants (FIG. 9). (2) Dehydration Stress Resistance of Plant that Expresses PRR5-VP32 The homozygous Arabidopsis thaliana plants harboring 35S::PRR5-VP32 and wild-type plants were allowed to grow in soil composed of a 1:1 mixture of vermiculite and culture soil with 16 hours in the light and 8 hours in the dark for 38 days. Rosette leaves were cut from the plant bodies and allowed to stand in a room at 25° C. for 14 hours, and the plant bodies were then photographed. The leaves cut from the plants expressing 35S::PRR5-VP32 contained more water than those of wild-type plants (FIG. 10). (3) Low Temperature Stress Resistance of Plant that Expresses PRR5-VP32 The homozygous Arabidopsis thaliana plants harboring 35S::PRR5-VP32 and wild-type plants were allowed to grow in soil composed of a 1:1 mixture of vermiculite and culture soil with 16 hours in the light and 8 hours in the dark for 26 days, placed in a thermostat-humidistat incubator set at −5° C. (Atmos Chamber, SANYO) for 24 hours, and then returned to the normal growth conditions. The plant bodies were photographed 5 days later. The plants expressing 35S::PRR5-VP32 were found to be more resistant to low temperature stress than wild-type plants (FIG. 11). Example 6 Acquisition of Rice that Expresses PRR5 PCR was carried out using pBS-35S::PRR5-FLAG prepared in Example 1 as a template, the primers (5′-AGAAGTCGACTCTAGATGACTAGTAGCGAGGAAG-3′: SEQ ID NO: 45 and 5′-TCGAGCTCGGTACCCTTACTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTG-3′: SEQ ID NO: 46), and PrimeStar enzyme to amplify the PRR5-FLAG sequence, and the resultant was incorporated between the XbaI restriction enzyme site and the SmaI restriction enzyme site of the pACT vector (Hirose et al., Plant Cell Physiol., vol. 48, 523-539, 2007) using the In-Fusion reaction (Takara) (pACT::PRR5-FLAG). The pACT::PRR5-FLAG vector was used to transform Agrobacterium EHA105. Rice calluses were infected with the transformed Agrobacterium by the Agrobacterium method. The fully ripened and unhulled seeds (100 to 120 grains) were soaked in a sterilization solution containing sodium hypochlorite, and the solution was slowly stirred for 30 minutes to sterilize the seeds. The seeds were thoroughly washed with sterile water and aseptically placed in callus induction medium (N6D medium, Hirose et al., Plant Cell Physiol., vol. 48, 523-539, 2007) in amounts of 10 seeds per petri dish, and cultured with 12.5 hours in the light at 28° C. and for 11.5 hours in the dark at 24° C. The albumen and shoot portions were removed from the seeds 3 weeks later, only calluses derived from scutellum were transferred to a fresh callus induction medium (N6D medium), and cultured for 3 days. The transformed Agrobacterium cells were applied to AB medium (Hirose et al., Plant Cell Physiol., vol. 48, 523-539, 2007) containing 50 μg/ml of kanamycin on the same day, and cultured at 28° C. with shading. Agrobacterium cells that had grown on AB medium were scraped off and suspended in a coexistence medium containing 20 μg/ml of acetosyringone (AAM solution, Hirose et al., Plant Cell Physiol., vol. 48, 523-539, 2007)3 days later, and OD600 of the suspension was adjusted to 0.15 to 0.2. The calluses that had been pre-cultured for 3 days were soaked in the Agrobacterium suspension, and the suspension was agitated by turning upside down for 1.5 minutes. After an excess Agrobacterium suspension was removed, the calluses were placed in a co-culture medium (2N6-AS medium, Hirose et al., Plant Cell Physiol., vol. 48, 523-539, 2007) containing 20 μg/ml of acetosyringone in amounts of 10 calluses per petri dish. Agrobacterium cells were co-cultured with calluses at 28° C. with shading. After 3 days, in order to remove the grown Agrobacterium cells, the calluses were collected in two 50-ml tubes, and the tubes were subjected to three rounds of 5-minutes agitation using a rotator with sterile water being poured and three rounds of 5-minutes agitation with sterile water containing 500 μg/ml of carbenicillin. The resultants were placed in a selection medium (N6D medium) containing 500 μg/ml of carbenicillin and 50 μg/ml of hygromycin in amounts of 10 calluses per petri dish, and cultured at 28° C. for 3 weeks. Thereafter, all the calluses were transferred to a redifferentiation medium containing 250 μg/ml of carbenicillin and 50 μg/ml of hygromycin, and the medium was exchanged with a fresh medium every 3 weeks until redifferentiation took place. The shoots that had been redifferentiated to approximately 2 cm were obtained approximately 1.5 months after the transfer of calluses to the redifferentiation medium. The resultants were transferred to Agripots in which a hormone-free medium containing 200 μg/ml of carbenicillin and 50 μg/ml of hygromycin had been poured and solidified to promote rooting, and the plants were allowed to grow to approximately 12 cm. It was confirmed by Western blotting that ACT-PRR5-FLAG was introduced into the nuclear genome of the shoot cell and the PRR5-FLAG protein was actually expressed. The shoots having the pACT vector being introduced into the genome were also obtained. Example 7 Biomass of rice That Expresses PRR5 The shoots having pACT-PRR5-FLAG or pACT being introduced were simultaneously transferred into soil in a pod (Akadama tsuchi with 1 g of a slow-acting fertilizer Temairazu per pod), and the plants were then allowed to grow under short-day conditions (from December to March) in a greenhouse with 12 hours in the light at 30° C. and 12 hours in the dark at 25° C. A mixture of sunlight and electric light was used for lighting. The rice plants having pACT-PRR5-FLAG being introduced exhibited phenotypes of greater numbers of stems and increased heights as compared with the rice plants having pACT being introduced (FIG. 12). That is, the biomass was increased. These phenotypes were also observed in independent transformants (lines exhibiting different recombinant DNA sites on chromosomes).

INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY According to the present invention, a transgenic plant exhibiting increased biomass and improved environmental stress resistance is obtained. Increased biomass of plants leads to increased biofuel production, and conferring of environmental stress resistance enables plants to grow in a severe environment (e.g., dehydration, low temperature, or high salt concentration). In addition, the transgenic plant of the present invention can be prepared in a simple and easy manner without a complicated procedure for preparing a PRR gene multiple mutant. 1.
