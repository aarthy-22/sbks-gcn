Field of Invention The subject invention relates to novel antimicrobial compounds and their compositions. Background The chemical and medical literature describes compounds that are said to be antimicrobial, i.e., capable of destroying or suppressing the growth or reproduction of microorganisms, such as bacteria. For example, such antibacterial agents are described in Antibiotics, Chemotherapeutics, and Antibacterial Agents for Disease Control (M. Greyson, editor, 1982), E. Gale et al., The Molecular Basis of Antibiotic Action 2d edition (1981), Recent Research Developments in Antimicrobial Agents & Chemotherapy (S. G. Pandalai, Editor, 2001), Quinolone Antimicrobial Agents (John S Wolfson., David C Hooper, Editors, 1989), and F. O'Grady, H. P. Lambert, R. G. Finch, D. Greenwood, Martin Dedicoat, "Antibiotic and Chemotherapy, 7th edn." (1997). The mechanisms of action of these antibacterial agents vary. However, they are generally believed to function in one or more ways: by inhibiting cell wall synthesis or repair; by altering cell wall permeability; by inhibiting protein synthesis; or by inhibiting the synthesis of nucleic acids. For example, beta-lactam antibacterial agents act through inhibiting essential penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) in bacteria, which are responsible for cell wall synthesis. As another example, quinolones act, at least in part by inhibiting synthesis of DNA, thus preventing the cell from replicating. The pharmacological characteristics of antimicrobial agents, and their suitability for any given clinical use, vary. For example, the classes of antimicrobial agents (and members within a class) may vary in 1) their relative efficacy against different types of microorganisms, 2) their susceptibility to development of microbial resistance and 3) their pharmacological characteristics such as their bioavailability and biodistribution. Accordingly, selection of an appropriate antimicrobial agent in a given clinical situation requires analysis of many factors, including the type of organism involved, the desired method of administration, the location of the infection to be treated and other considerations. However, many such attempts to produce improved antimicrobial agents yield equivocal results. Indeed, few antimicrobial agents are produced that are truly clinically acceptable in terms of their spectrum of antimicrobial activity, avoidance of microbial resistance, and pharmacology. Thus there is a continuing need for broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, which are effective against resistant microbes.

Examples of bacterial infections resistant to antibiotic therapy have been reported in the past; they are now a significant threat to public health in the developed world. The development of microbial resistance (perhaps as a result of the intense use of antibacterial agents over extended periods of time) is of increasing concern in medical science. "Resistance" can be defined as existence of organisms, within a population of a given microbial species, that are less susceptible to the action of a given antimicrobial agent. This resistance is of particular concern in environments such as hospitals and nursing homes, where relatively high rates of infection and intense use of antibacterial agents are common. See, e.g., W. Sanders, Jr. et al., "Inducible Beta-lactamases: Clinical and Epidemiologic Implications for the Use of Newer Cephalosporins", Review of Infectious Diseases, p. 830 (1988). Pathogenic bacteria are known to acquire resistance via several distinct mechanisms including inactivation of the antibiotic by bacterial enzymes (e.g., β-lactamases hydrolyzing penicillin and cephalosporins); removal of the antibiotic using efflux pumps; modification of the target of the antibiotic via mutation and genetic recombination (e.g., penicillin-resistance in Neiserria gonorrhoeae); and acquisition of a readily transferable gene from an external source to create a resistant target (e.g., methicillin-resistance in Staphylococcus aureus). There are certain Gram-positive pathogens, such as vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, which are resistant to virtually all commercially available antibiotics. Hence existing antibacterial agents have limited capacity in overcoming the threat of resistance. Thus it would be advantageous to provide new antibacterial agents that can be used against resistant microbes. US 2003/216568 A1 discloses antimicrobial 7-substituted piperidino-quinolone carboxylic acid derivatives, as well as methods for their preparation and their use in methods of treating a systemic or topical infection. WO 2005/033108 A1 discloses 7-amino alkylidenyl-heterocyclic quinolone and naphthyridone antimicrobial compounds and their use in methods of treating a subject having a condition caused by or contributed to by bacterial infection.

Furthermore, some of the crystalline forms for the compounds may exist as polymorphs and as such are intended to be included in the present invention. In addition, some of the compounds may form solvates with water (i.e., hydrates) or common organic solvents, and such solvates are also intended to be encompassed within the scope of this invention. Some of the compounds of the present invention may have trans and cis isomers. In addition, where the processes for the preparation of the compounds according to the invention give rise to mixture of stereoisomers, these isomers may be separated by conventional techniques such as preparative chromatography. The compounds may be prepared as a single stereoisomer or in racemic form as a mixture of some possible stereoisomers. The non-racemic forms may be obtained by either synthesis or resolution. The compounds may, for example, be resolved into their component enantiomers by standard techniques, such as the formation of diastereomeric pairs by salt formation. The compounds may also be resolved by covalent linkage to a chiral auxiliary, followed by chromatographic separation and/or crystallographic separation, and removal of the chiral auxiliary. Alternatively, the compounds may be resolved using chiral chromatography. The phrase "a pharmaceutically acceptable salt" denotes one or more salts of the free base or free acid which possess the desired pharmacological activity of the free base or free acid as appropriate and which are neither biologically nor otherwise undesirable. These salts may be derived from inorganic or organic acids. Examples of inorganic acids are hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, or phosphoric acid. Examples of organic acids are acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, malic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid and salicylic acid. Suitable salts are furthermore those of inorganic or organic bases such as KOH, NaOH, Ca(OH)2, Al(OH)3, piperidine, morpholine, ethylamine and triethylamine. Included within the scope of the invention are the hydrated forms of the compounds that contain various amounts of water, for instance, the hydrate, hemihydrate, and sesquihydrate forms. The present disclosure also contemplates prodrugs of the compounds of this disclosure. In general, such prodrugs will be functional derivatives of the compounds that are readily convertible in vivo into the required compound. Thus, in the methods of treatment of the present disclosure, the term "administering" shall encompass the treatment of the various disorders described with the compound specifically disclosed or with a compound which may not be specifically disclosed, but which converts to the specified compound in vivo after administration to the patient. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in "Design of Prodrugs", ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985. The term "subject" includes, without limitation, any animal or artificially modified animal. As a particular embodiment, the subject is a human. The term "drug-resistant" or "drug-resistance" refers to the characteristics of a microbe to survive in the presence of a currently available antimicrobial agent such as an antibiotic at its routine, effective concentration. Table 1 contains a non-limiting list of preferred compounds of Formula I of these, compounds 257, 261 268, 269, 277, 302 and 303 are compounds of the present invention.

In addition, the skilled artisan will also recognize the judicious choice of reactions, solvents, and temperatures are an important component in successful synthesis. While the determination of optimal conditions, etc. is routine, it will be understood that a variety of compounds can be generated in a similar fashion, using the guidance of the schemes below. The starting materials used in preparing the compounds of the invention are known, made by published synthetic methods or available from commercial vendors. It is recognized that the skilled artisan in the art of organic chemistry can readily carry out standard manipulations of the organic compounds without further direction; that is, it is well within the scope and practice of the skilled artisan to carry out such manipulations. These include, but are not limited to, reductions of carbonyl compounds to their corresponding alcohols, oxidations, acylations, aromatic substitutions, both electrophilic and nucleophilic, etherifications, esterification and saponification. Examples of these manipulations are discussed in standard texts such as March, Advanced Organic Chemistry (Wiley), Carey and Sundberg, Advanced Organic Chemistry (Vol. 2), Feiser & Feiser, Reagents for Organic Synthesis (16 volumes), L.

The skilled artisan will readily appreciate that certain reactions are best carried out when other functionality is masked or protected in the molecule, thus avoiding any undesirable side reactions and/or increasing the yield of the reaction. Often the skilled artisan utilizes protecting groups to accomplish such increased yields or to avoid the undesired reactions. Examples of these manipulations can be found for example in T. Greene, Protecting Groupsin Organic Synthesis. General procedures for preparing heterocyclic nuclei useful in making the compounds of the invention are described in the following references (including articles listed within the references): U.S. Patent 6329391, European Patent Publication 342849, International Patent Publication WO9711068, European Patent Publication 195316, European Patent Publication 1031569, U.S. Patent 6025370, European Patent Publication 153828, European Patent Publication 191451, European Patent Publication 153163, European Patent Publication 230053, European Patent Publication 976749, International Patent Publication WO0118005, International Patent Publication WO9407873, U.S. Patent 4777253, European Patent Publication 421668, International Patent Publication WO0248138, European Patent Publication 230295, International Patent Publication WO9914214, U.S. Patent Publication 20020049223, International Patent Publication WO9921849, International Patent Publication WO9729102, International Patent Publication WO0334980, International Patent Publication WO0209758, International Patent Publication WO9619472, German Patent Publication DE 3142854, International Patent Publication WO0334980, International Patent Publication WO0328665, European Patent Publication 47005, International Patent Publication WO0311450, and European Patent Publication 688772. The compounds of the disclosure may be prepared in several ways. Versatile methodologies for preparation of the compounds of the disclosure are shown in Scheme I below, where L is a leaving group such as fluoro or chloro: In the case where E is and at least one of R9 and R10 is hydrogen, it may be necessary to protect the terminal nitrogen to effect selective conversion to the desired product (Scheme II). In such case, standard amine protecting groups known to those skilled in the art, such as t-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz), benzyl (Bn), 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc), allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc), 2-trimethylsilylethoxycarbonyl (Teoc), N-formyl, N-acetyl, N-benzoyl, or phthalimide, may be used to mask the terminal amine, as in compound V. Following side chain coupling, the protecting group may be removed under standard conditions known to those skilled in the art to obtain the desired product VII. VII may be further elaborated, for example by alkylation, to other compounds of the disclosure VIII. Methodologies for providing the compounds of the disclosure where X is N and Y is C(R1) are shown in Scheme III below: As before, where E is and at least one of R9 and R10 is hydrogen, it may be necessary to protect the terminal nitrogen to effect selective conversion to the desired product (Scheme IV). In such case, standard amine protecting groups known to those skilled in the art, such as t-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz), benzyl (Bn), 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc), allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc), 2-trimethylsilylethoxycarbonyl (Teoc), N-formyl, N-acetyl, N-benzoyl, or phthalimide, may be used to mask the terminal amine, as in compound V. Following side chain coupling, the protecting group may be removed under standard conditions known to those skilled in the art to obtain the desired product XIII. XIII may be further elaborated, for example by alkylation, to other compounds of the disclosure XIV. In the case where E is and both R9 and R10 are hydrogen, selective alkylation of the side chain amine of LXI may also be accomplished by protection of the amine with a standard protecting group, such as Boc, utilizing reagents and conditions apparent to those skilled in the art to give LXII (Scheme XXXVI). The protected amine (LXII) is then treated with an excess (>2 equivalents) of a base, such as, but not limited to, sodium hydride, in an appropriate inert solvent, such as dimethylformamide or tetrahydrofuran, followed by the appropriate alkylating agent R9X to yield the boc-protected secondary amine as the corresponding ester LXIII. Typically, the reaction is run at temperatures ranging from -20°C to 60°C for from 1 to 48 hours depending on the reactivity of the alkylating agent. Typical alkylating agents including alkyl iodides (such as methyl iodide), alkyl bromides and alkyl sulfonates. The ester LXIII may be hydrolyzed under basic conditions to afford the corresponding carboxylic acid LXIV. Ester hydrolysis may be conducted by methods familiar to those skilled in the art, in particular, by employing a base such as an alkali metal hydroxide (for example, sodium hydroxide) or an alkali metal carbonate in a suitable solvent, such as water, methanol, ethanol, or aqueous alcohol mixtures, at a temperature ranging from 20°C to 100°C for from 1 to 48 hours. Removal of the amine-protecting group under conditions apparent to one skilled in the art affords the secondary amine LXV. In the case where the protecting group is Boc, for example, reagents such as with trifluoroacetic acid, optionally with methylene chloride as co-solvent, or hydrochloric acid in dioxane, may be used for deprotection. Occasionally, side chain amines are insufficiently reactive to add efficiently to the heterocyclic nuclei (II or X) under the conditions illustrated in Schemes I-IV, particularly when A is C(R11), wherein R11 is alkoxy. The nucleus can be activated towards nucleophilic attack by the addition of a Lewis acid such as, but not limited to, boron trifluoride, triacetoxyborate, and lithium chloride. The preferred method of activation is described in U.S. Patent 5,157,117. The quinolone nucleus is treated with triacetoxyborate, prepared in situ, in solvent such as, but not limited to, acetic acid or propionic acid and is heated for 1 to 24 h at a temperature between 60°C and 120°C. The diacyl quinolinylborate (XV) is isolated by filtration after removal of the solvent. Scheme V illustrates this preferred method of activation. Another preferred method for activating the heterocyclic nucleus toward nucleophilic attack is illustrated in Scheme XXXVII. In this method, a quinolone carboxylic acid or ester derivative (i.e., compound II wherein R is hydrogen or lower alkyl and L is a leaving group) is treated with boron trifluoride etherate, preferably in a suitable solvent, such as THF, for from 1 hour to 48 hours at temperatures ranging from 0°C to 60°C. After cooling, the product LXVI may be precipitated from the reaction mixture by the addition of a suitable solvent, such as diethyl ether, and the chelate isolated by filtration of the resulting solid. Precursor Preparation - Side chain amine III Scheme VI illustrates the synthesis of the side chain amine III wherein E is R7 and R8 are hydrogen, and q is 1.

Removal of the protecting group, P, under standard conditions known to those skilled in the art affords amine III, wherein E is R7 and R8 are hydrogen, and q is 1. Alternatively, direct replacement of the alcohol XVIII can be accomplished via a Mitsunobu reaction with phthalimide and dialkyl azodicarboxylate to afford XXI. Deprotection of the phthalimide (XXI) with hydrazine in a solvent such as methanol or ethanol affords the amine (XX), wherein R9 and R10 are hydrogen. Alternative methods of deprotection include treatment with methylamine in methanol or with 6N hydrochloric acid. The protecting group, P, may be removed from XXI under standard conditions known to those skilled in the art to provide the amine V, wherein R7 and R8 are hydrogen and R9 and P" together with the nitrogen to which they are attached form a phthalimide group. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the conversion of ketone XVI to olefin XVII may lead to geometrical isomers (Scheme VI), specifically in the case where XVI is asymmetric (i.e., the value of m is not equal to n). In such a case, the geometrical isomers may be separated by a number of methods known to those skilled in the art, including selective recrystallization, flash chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, and the like. It should also be apparent that separation may be achieved at various stages in the synthetic process, including at intermediates XVII, XVIII, XIX, or XXI, or alternatively at the final product stage XX. Scheme XXXVIII illustrates the synthesis of the side chain amine LXX wherein E is R5 is cyano, R7 and R8 are hydrogen, and q is 1.

The cyano-substituted alkenyl bromides can undergo bromine-magnesium exchange with i-PrMgBr in an inert solvent, such as THF, at temperatures ranging from -78°C to -20°C. The resulting organomagnesium species, as a solution in a suitable solvent such as THF, may be treated with an electrophile such as formaldehyde, optionally stabilized with methylaluminum bis(2,6-diphenylphenoxide), in a suitable solvent, such as methylene chloride, for from 1 to 24 hours at temperatures ranging from -20°C to 37°C to give the alcohol LXVIII. Direct replacement of the alcohol LXVIII can be accomplished via a Mitsunobu reaction with phthalimide and a dialkyl azodicarboxylate to afford LXIX. Deprotection of the phthalimide (LXIX) with hydrazine in a solvent such as methanol or ethanol affords the amine (LXX), wherein R9 and R10 are hydrogen. Alternative methods of deprotection include treatment with methylamine in methanol or heating with 6N hydrochloric acid. The protecting group, P, may be removed from LXX under standard conditions known to those skilled in the art to provide the amine V, wherein R5 is cyano, R7 and R8 are hydrogen and R9 and P" together with the nitrogen to which they are attached form a phthalimide group. The cyano group of compound LXIX may also be converted to alternate functionalities, such as carboxy or alkoxycarbonyl, to afford amines LXXI or LXXII (Scheme XXXIX). For example, basic hydrolysis of nitrile LXIX with an alkali metal hydroxide, such as potassium hydroxide, in a suitable solvent, such as water, methanol, ethanol, or aqueous alcohol mixtures, at a temperature ranging from 20°C to 100°C for from 1 to 48 hours, followed by acid hydrolysis of the phthalamido group, with, for example, 6N hydrochloric acid at a temperature ranging from 60°C to 100°C for from 1 to 48 hours affords the corresponding amino acid derivative LXXI where R9 and R10 are hydrogen. Alternatively, acid hydrolysis of nitrile LXIX with a mineral acid in the presence of an alcohol at a temperature ranging from 20°C to 200°C for from 30 minutes to 48 hours, optionally under microwave irradiation, provides the corresponding amino ester derivative LXXII where R9 and R10 are hydrogen. Suitable mineral acids include, but are not limited to, sulfuric acid. Suitable alcohols include, but are not limited to, ethanol. Although Scheme XXXIX illustrates the conversion of nitrile LXIX to amino acid derivative LXXI and amino ester derivative LXXII with the ring nitrogen attached to a protecting group, the ring nitrogen may also be bound to the quinolone or naphthyridine nucleus as in compound VIII while performing the above transformations.

In addition, the Scheme outlines the synthesis of compounds of formula III, wherein E is R7 and R8 are hydrogen and R9 is acyl, alkoxycarbonyl, or sulfonyl (LX). Oxidation of alcohol XVIII with any of a number of suitable oxidizing agents, such as Dess-Martin periodinane, the Corey-Kim reagent, or the Swern reagent, affords the corresponding aldehyde (LVI). The aldehyde may be subjected to a base promoted olefination reaction, such as, but not limited to, the Wittig reaction to give LVII, wherein Rc is hydrogen or alkyl.

Biological Activity The compounds described in the present disclosure possess antibacterial activity due to their novel structure, and are useful as antibacterial agents for the treatment of bacterial infections in humans and animals. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) has been an indicator of in vitro antibacterial activity widely used in the art. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the compounds was determined by the microdilution broth method following the test method from the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). This method is described in the NCCLS Document M7-A4, Vol.17, No.2, "Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test for Bacteria that Grow Aerobically--Fourth Edition". In this method two-fold serial dilutions of drug in cation adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth are added to wells in microdilution trays. The test organisms are prepared by adjusting the turbidity of actively growing broth cultures so that the final concentration of test organism after it is added to the wells is approximately 5 x 104 CFU/well. Following inoculation of the microdilution trays, the trays are incubated at 35 °C for 16-20 hours and then read. The MIC is the lowest concentration of test compound that completely inhibits growth of the test organism. The amount of growth in the wells containing the test compound is compared with the amount of growth in the growth-control wells (no test compound) used in each tray. As set forth in Table 5, compounds of the present disclosure were tested against a variety of pathogenic bacteria resulting in a range of activities depending on the organism tested. Of these, compounds 247 - 263, 267-277, 283, 285, 286, 289, 291-292, 294-295, and 297-303 are compounds of the invention. Table 5.
