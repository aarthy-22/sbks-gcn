Green tea catechin leads to global improvement among Alzheimer's disease-related phenotypes in NSE/hAPP-C105 Tg mice.
Amyloid β (Αβ) has been reported to be responsible for the functional and structural abnormalities of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through the induction of oxidative stress.
The aim of this study was to determine whether or not treatment of transgenic (Tg) mice with green tea catechin (GTC), a radical scavenger, improves AD phenotypes.
To test this, 7-month-old Tg mice were treated with a low (1 mg) or high (10 mg) dose of GTC for 6 months.
Surprisingly, GTC-treated Tg mice exhibited significant decreases in behavioral impairment, Aβ-42 production, APP-C99/89 expression, γ-secretase component and Wnt protein levels, γ-secretase activity and MAPK activation.
In contrast, the levels of APP-C83 protein and enzyme activities (α-secretase, neprilysin and Pin1) were elevated in the GTC-treated groups.
Moreover, GTC-treated groups showed lower levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, whereas the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased.
These results provide the first experimental evidence that GTC improves AD phenotypes, thereby suggesting that GTC can be used in the prevention of AD or treatment of AD patients.
