Curcuminoids Modulate Pro-Oxidant-Antioxidant Balance but not the Immune Response to Heat Shock Protein 27 and Oxidized LDL in Obese Individuals.
Curcuminoids have potentially important functional qualities including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.
In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over trial, the effects of a curcuminoid supplement on serum pro-oxidant-antioxidant balance (PAB) and antibody titres to Hsp27 (anti-Hsp27) and oxLDL (anti-oxLDL) were investigated.
Thirty obese individuals were randomized to receive either curcuminoids (1 g/day) or placebo for a period of 30 days.
After a wash-out period of 2 weeks, subjects were crossed over to the alternate regimen for another 30 days.
Serum PAB along with anti-Hsp27 and anti-oxLDL titres was measured at the beginning and at the end of each study period.
There was no significant carry-over effect for any of the assessed parameters.
Curcuminoid supplementation was associated with a significant decrease in PAB (p = 0.044).
However, no significant change was observed in serum concentrations of anti-Hsp27 or anti-oxLDL (p > 0.05).
These findings suggest that oral curcuminoids supplementation (1g/day) is effective in reducing oxidative stress burden, though this needs to be validated in larger study populations.
