A new concept of drug delivery for acne.
Adapalene is a stable naphthoic acid derivative that displays a strong retinoid agonist pharmacology.

The retinoid action of adapalene are mediated by the ligand-activated gene transcription factors retinoic acid receptors RAR beta and RAR gamma.
We describe here how an aqueous gel containing adapalene was selected for the topical treatment of acne.
