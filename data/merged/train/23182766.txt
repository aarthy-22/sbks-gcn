Control of hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis using the cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid sequence of the translocator protein TSPO.
The translocator protein (18-kDa) TSPO is an ubiquitous high affinity cholesterol-binding protein reported to be present in the endothelial and smooth muscle cells of the blood vessels; its expression dramatically increased in macrophages found in atherosclerotic plaques.
A domain in the carboxy-terminus of TSPO was identified and characterized as the cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus (CRAC).
The ability of the CRAC domain to bind to cholesterol led us to hypothesize that this peptide could be used as an hypocholesterolemic, with potential anti-atherogenic properties, agent.
We report herein the therapeutic benefit that resulted for the administration of the VLNYYVWR human CRAC sequence to guinea pigs fed with a high cholesterol diet and ApoE knock-out B6.129P2-Apoetm1Unc/J mice.
CRAC treatment (3 and 30mg/kg once daily for 6 weeks) resulted in reduced circulating cholesterol levels in guinea pigs fed with 2% high cholesterol diet and ApoE knock-out B6.129P2-Apoetm1Unc/J mice.
In high cholesterol fed guinea pigs, CRAC treatment administered once daily induced an increase in circulating HDL, decreased total, free and LDL cholesterol, and removed atheroma deposits in the aorta in a dose-dependent manner.
The treatment also prevented the high cholesterol diet-induced increase in serum creatine kinase, total and isoforms, markers of neurological, cardiac and muscular damage.
No toxicity was observed.
Taken together these results support a role of TSPO in lipid homeostasis and atherosclerosis and indicate that CRAC may constitute a novel and safe treatment of hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis.
