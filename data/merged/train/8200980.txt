Two subsets of HLA-DQA1 alleles mark phenotypic variation in levels of insulin autoantibodies in first degree relatives at risk for insulin-dependent diabetes.
Levels of insulin autoantibodies (IAA) vary among different first degree relatives of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients, suggesting genetic regulation.
We previously reported elevated IAA among DR4-positive at risk relatives.
In this study, 72/82 at risk relatives were IAA positive, of whom 75% (54/72) carried DR4 versus 20% (2/10) of IAA-negative relatives (P = 0.0004).
However, 69% (18/26) of DR4-negative relatives were IAA positive.
Since DR4 did not account for all IAA positivity, we analyzed DQA1 and DQB1 alleles.
Homozygosity for DQA1 alleles deriving from the evolutionary lineage 4 (*0401, *0501, *0601) was associated with low IAA levels, while lineage 1-3 alleles (*0101, *0102, *0103, *0201, *0301) correlated with higher levels.
Most (93%, 65/70) relatives with lineage 1-3 alleles were IAA positive (mean = 360 +/- 63 SEM nU/ml).
Only 7/12 relatives homozygous for lineage 4 alleles were IAA-positive, with lower levels than relatives with lineage 1-3 alleles (mean = 55 +/- 15 SEM nU/ml, P < 0.0001; 7/12 vs 65/70, P = 0.004).
The amino acid sequences of lineage 1-3 alleles uniquely share glutamic acid (E) and phenylalanine (F) at positions 40 and 51 (EF alleles).
Lineage 4 alleles have glycine (G) and leucine (L) at those positions (GL alleles).
90% (65/72) of IAA-positive relatives had an EF allele, while only 75% (54/72) had DR4 (P = 0.01).
Homozygosity for GL alleles (often DQA1 *0501 on DR3 haplotypes) correlated with little or no humoral response to insulin.
Thus, HLA-DQB1 GL alleles, or other genes on haplotypes (e.g., DR3) that carry these DQA1 alleles, may confer recessive low responsiveness to insulin.
