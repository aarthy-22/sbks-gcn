Mutant B-RAF-Mcl-1 survival signaling depends on the STAT3 transcription factor.
Approximately 50% of melanomas depend on mutant B-RAF for proliferation, metastasis and survival.
The inhibition of oncogenic B-RAF with highly targeted compounds has produced remarkable albeit short-lived clinical responses in B-RAF mutant melanoma patients.
Reactivation of signaling downstream of B-RAF is frequently associated with acquired resistance to B-RAF inhibitors, and the identification of B-RAF targets may provide new strategies for managing melanoma.
Oncogenic B-RAF(V600E) is known to promote the stabilizing phosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, implicated in melanoma survival and chemoresistance.
We now show that B-RAF(V600E) signaling also induces the transcription of Mcl-1 in melanocytes and melanoma.
We demonstrate that activation of STAT3 serine-727 and tyrosine-705 phosphorylations is promoted by B-RAF(V600E) activity and that the Mcl-1 promoter is dependent on a STAT consensus-site for B-RAF-mediated activation.
Consequently, suppression of STAT3 activity disrupted B-RAF(V600E)-mediated induction of Mcl-1 and reduced melanoma cell survival.
We propose that STAT3 has a central role in the survival and contributes to chemoresistance of B-RAF(V600E) melanoma.
