Neuroprotective effects of mercaptoethylleonurine and mercaptoethylguanidine analogs on hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis in human neuronal SH-SY5Y cells.
A series of mercaptoethylleonurine and mercaptoethylguanidine derivatives were designed and synthesized.
Their neuroprotective effects toward H2O2-induced apoptosis were investigated in human SH-SY5Y cells.
The results from these studies identified several potent compounds, with compound 8k emerging as the most effective.
Further investigation demonstrated that 8k reduced H2O2-induced activation of mitochondrial apoptosis by inhibiting the expression of Bax and elevating the expression of Bcl-2.
Moreover, the molecular mechanism underlying the observed neuroprotective effects of 8k was exerted via the Akt and JNK pathways.
Compound 8k can be a lead compound for further discovery of neuroprotective medicine.
