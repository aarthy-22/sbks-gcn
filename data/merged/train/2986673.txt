Drug-protein interactions: binding of chlorpromazine to calmodulin, calmodulin fragments, and related calcium binding proteins.
The quantitative binding of a phenothiazine drug to calmodulin, calmodulin fragments, and structurally related calcium binding proteins was measured under conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium by using a gel filtration method.
Plant and animal calmodulins, troponin C, S100 alpha, and S100 beta bind chlorpromazine in a calcium-dependent manner with different stoichiometries and affinities for the drug.
The interaction between calmodulin and chlorpromazine appears to be a complex, calcium-dependent phenomenon.
Bovine brain calmodulin bound approximately 5 mol of drug per mol of protein with apparent half-maximal binding at 17 microM drug.
Large fragments of calmodulin had limited ability to bind chlorpromazine.
The largest fragment, containing residues 1-90, retained only 5% of the drug binding activity of the intact protein.
A reinvestigation of the chlorpromazine inhibition of calmodulin stimulation of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase further indicated a complex, multiple equilibrium among the reaction components and demonstrated that the order of addition of components to the reaction altered the drug concentration required for half-maximal inhibition of the activity over a 10-fold range.
These results confirm previous observations using immobilized phenothiazines [Marshak, D.R., Watterson, D.M., & Van Eldik, L.J. (1981) Proc.
