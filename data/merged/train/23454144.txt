Role of oxidative stress in chemical allergens induced skin cells activation.
Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is an important occupational and environmental disease caused by topical exposure to chemical allergens.
It describes the adverse effects that may results when exposure to a chemical elicits a T cell-mediated inflammatory skin disease.
The ability of contact sensitizers to induce the oxidative stress pathway in keratinocytes and dendritic cells has been confirmed by several authors.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can serve as essential second messengers mediating cellular responses resulting in immune cells activation.
Oxidative stress may be the starter point, as it leads to the activation of transcription factors and signaling pathways, including NF-kB and p38 MAPK, which leads to the release of cytokines and chemokines.
ROS are also involved in the activation of the NLRP3/NALP3 inflammasome, which is required to direct the proteolytic maturation of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, which are all integral to the process of dendritic cells mobilization, migration and functional maturation.
Moreover, emerging evidence correlates ROS to changes in the constitution of the extracellular microenvironment found to facilitate ACD.
The purpose of this review is to provide both conceptual and technical frameworks on the role of oxidative stress in chemical allergy.
