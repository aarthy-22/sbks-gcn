Dienogest is a selective progesterone receptor agonist in transactivation analysis with potent oral endometrial activity due to its efficient pharmacokinetic profile.
Dienogest was introduced as an oral progestin.
Yet its strong oral potency on endometrial activity is not clearly explained.
To circumvent this situation, steroid hormone receptor profiling using transactivation assay and endometrial activity test in rabbits were carried out with determination of plasma drug concentration.
Agonistic/antagonistic activity on human progesterone receptor (PR), androgen receptor (AR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), or estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) were determined.
Dienogest activate PR (EC50=3.4 or 10.5 nmol/l) with antagonistic activity on AR (EC50=420.6 or 775.0 nmol/l) but not agonistic nor antagonistic action on GR, MR (3000 nmol/l).
Dienogest activate neither ERalpha nor ERbeta (3000 nmol/l).
Progesterone activated PR with antagonistic activity on AR and on MR.
Dydrogesterone showed a similar profile to progesterone.
Norethisterone activated PR, AR, and ERalpha.
Medroxyprogesterone acetate activated PR, AR, and GR.
Danazol activated PR and AR.
Collectively, dienogest has a good specificity to PR compared with the other drugs.
By oral treatment, dienogest showed the strongest endometrial activity (ED50=0.0042 mg/kg) in McPhail test among other progestins (ED50 values for MPA, DYG, NES were 0.074, 1.9, >0.05 mg/kg, respectively).
Dienogest showed higher plasma concentrations than those of the other progestins with higher doses.
The estimated plasma concentration of dienogest at ED50 (3.66 nmol/l) was close to its EC50 value to activate PR.
Thus, the stronger oral activity of dienogest could be explained simply by its in vitro potency on PR and its oral pharmacokinetic profile.
