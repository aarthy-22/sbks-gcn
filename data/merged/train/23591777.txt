Hepatoprotective effect of methylsulfonylmethane against carbon tetrachloride-induced acute liver injury in rats.
This study evaluated the effect of methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) on carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced acute liver injury in rats.
A single injection of CCl4 (2 ml/kg, i.p.) increased serum aminotransferases (ALT and AST) activities.
In addition, CCl4 treatment led to elevation of hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) content as well as decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities.
Furthermore, cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) content was suppressed while proinflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels increased in liver tissue after CCl4 administration.
We showed that acute CCl4-induced damage was accompanied by a rise in Bax/Bcl2 ratio indicating apoptosis.
Pre-treatment with MSM (400 mg/kg) inhibited the increases of serum ALT and AST activities, decreased hepatic MDA, TNF-α, IL-6 and Bax/Bcl2 ratio compared to CCl4 treated group.
On the other hand, MSM raised SOD and CAT activities as well as CYP2E1 level in liver tissues.
The present study shows that MSM possesses a hepatoprotective effect against CCl4-induced liver injury in rats.
This protective effect might be through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic properties.
