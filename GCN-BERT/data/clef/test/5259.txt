CLEANING COMPOSITION CONTAINING A POLYETHERAMINE TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates generally to a cleaning composition and, more specifically, to a hard surface cleaning composition containing a polyetheramine that provides benefits in terms of the removal of greasy soils. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The detergent formulator is constantly aiming to improve the performance of detergent compositions. One of the biggest challenges encountered in hard surface cleaning is the removal of greasy soils, in particular the removal of greasy soils from hydrophobic items such as plastic. The challenge is not only to remove the grease from hydrophobic items but also to leave them feeling not greasy or slippery. Ideally, consumers like to clean items to achieve squeaky cleanness, i.e., the items are so clean that when a finger is slid along the item a squeaky noise is produced. This noise is associated with total cleanness. The objective of the present invention is to provide a hand dishwashing composition with improved grease soil removal. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the first aspect of the invention there is provided a cleaning composition, preferably the composition is a hand dishwashing cleaning composition. The composition is preferably in liquid form. The composition comprises a surfactant system and a polyetheramine selected from the group consisting of polyetheramines of Formula (I), (II), (III) and a mixture thereof. The composition of the invention provides excellent grease removal, even from hydrophobic items, such as plastics. The composition leaves even plastic items feeling squeaky clean. The surfactant system of the composition of the invention comprises an anionic surfactant and a primary co-surfactant selected from the group consisting of amphoteric, zwitteronic and mixtures thereof. The anionic surfactant can be any anionic cleaning surfactant, especially preferred anionic surfactants are selected from the group consisting of alkyl sulfate, alkyl alkoxy sufate, alkyl benzene sulfonate, paraffin sulfonate and mixtures thereof. Preferred anionic surfactants are selected from alkyl sulfate, alkyl alkoxy sulfate and mixtures thereof, a preferred alkyl alkoxy sulfate is alkyl ethoxy sulfate. Preferred anionic surfactant for use herein is a mixture of alkyl sulfate and alkyl ethoxy sulfate. Extremely useful surfactant systems for use herein include those comprising anionic surfactants, in combination with amine oxide, especially alkyl dimethyl amine oxides, and/or betaine surfactants. Another preferred surfactant system for use herein is an anionic and amphoteric/zwitterionic system in which the amphoteric to zwitterionic weight ratio is preferably from about 2:1 to about 1:2.. In particular a system in which the amphoteric surfactant is an amine oxide surfactant and the zwitteronic surfactant is a betaine and the weight ratio of the amine oxide to the betaine is about 1 :1. Also preferred for use herein are surfactant systems further comprising non-ionic surfactants. Especially preferred nonionic surfactants are alkyl alkoxylated nonionic surfactants, especially alkyl ethoxylated surfactants. Especially preferred surfactant systems for the composition of the invention comprise an anionic surfactant preferably selected from the group consisting of alkyl sulfate, alkyl alkoxy sulfate and mixtures thereof, more preferably an alkyl alkoxylated sulfate, and an amphoteric surfactant, preferably an amino oxide surfactant and a non-ionic surfactant. In summary, the most preferred surfactant system for use herein comprises an alkyl alkoxylated sulfate surfactant, amine oxide and non-ionic surfactant, especially an alkyl ethoxylated sulfate surfactant, alkyl dimethyl amine oxide and an alkyl ethoxylate nonionic surfactant. Preferably, the composition of the invention comprises a salt of a divalent cation. In particular, a salt of magnesium. It has been found that magnesium cations can work in combination with the polyetheramine by strengthening and broadening the grease cleaning profile of the composition. Preferably, the composition of the invention comprises a chelant. It has been found that chelants can act together with the polyetheramine of the invention to provide improved cleaning.

Examples of suitable catalysts are basic catalysts such as alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydroxides, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide, alkali metal alkoxides, in particular sodium and potassium Ci-C4-alkoxides, such as sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide and potassium tert-butoxide, alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydrides, such as sodium hydride and calcium hydride, and alkali metal carbonates, such as sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate. Alkali metal hydroxides, such as potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide, are particularly suitable. Typical use amounts for the basic catalyst are from about 0.05 to about 10% by weight, in particular from about 0.1 to about 2% by weight, based on the total amount of the low-molecular-weight triol and the alkylene oxide. Amination Polyetheramines according to Formula (III) may be obtained by reductive amination of an alkoxylated triol, such as those described above, for example alkoxylated glycerine or alkoxylated 1,1,1-trimethylolpropane, with ammonia in the presence of hydrogen and a catalyst, such as a catalyst containing nickel. Suitable catalysts are described in WO 2011/067199 Al, in WO2011/067200 Al, and in EP0696572 Bl. The amination may be carried out in the presence of copper-, nickel- or cobalt-containing catalyst. Preferred catalysts are supported copper-, nickel- and cobalt-containing catalysts, wherein the catalytically active material of the catalysts, before the reduction thereof with hydrogen, comprises oxygen compounds of aluminium, copper, nickel and cobalt, and, in the range of from about 0.2% to about 5.0% by weight, of oxygen compounds of tin, calculated as SnO. Other preferred catalysts are supported copper-, nickel- and cobalt-containing catalysts, wherein the catalytically active material of the catalysts, before the reduction thereof with hydrogen, comprises oxygen compounds of aluminium, copper, nickel, cobalt, tin, and, in the range of from about 0.2 to about 5.0% by weight, of oxygen compounds of yttrium, lanthanum, cerium and/or hafnium, each calculated as Y2O3, La203, Ce203 and Hf203, respectively. Another suitable catalyst is a zirconium, copper, nickel catalyst, wherein the catalytically active composition comprises from about 20 to about 85 % by weight of oxygen-containing zirconium compounds, calculated as Zr02, from about 1 to about 30% by weight of oxygen-containing compounds of copper, calculated as CuO, from about 30 to about 70 % by weight of oxygen- containing compounds of nickel, calculated as NiO, from about 0.1 to about 5 % by weight of oxygen-containing compounds of aluminium and/ or manganese, calculated as AI2O3 and Mn02, respectively. For the reductive amination step, a supported as well as a non-supported catalyst can be used. The supported catalyst may be obtained by deposition of the metallic components of the catalyst compositions onto support materials known to those skilled in the art, using techniques that are well-known in the art, including, without limitation, known forms of alumina, silica, charcoal, carbon, graphite, clays, mordenites; molecular sieves may be used to provide supported catalysts as well. When the catalyst is supported, the support particles of the catalyst may have any geometric shape, for example, the shape of spheres, tablets, or cylinders in a regular or irregular version. The process can be carried out in a continuous or discontinuous mode, e.g., in an autoclave, tube reactor, or fixed-bed reactor. A number of reactor designs may be used. For example, the feed thereto may be upflowing or downflowing, and design features in the reactor that optimize plug flow in the reactor may be employed. The degree of amination may be from about 67% to about 100%, or from about 85% to about 100%. The degree of amination is calculated from the total amine value (AZ) divided by sum of the total acetylables value (AC) and tertiary amine value (tert. AZ) multiplied by 100 (Total AZ / ((AC+tert. AZ)xl00)). The total amine value (AZ) is determined according to DIN 16945. The total acetylables value (AC) is determined according to DIN 53240. The secondary and tertiary amines are determined according to ASTM D2074-07. The hydroxyl value is calculated from (total acetylables value + tertiary amine value) - total amine value.

Preservatives The composition of the invention preferably comprises a preservative. A preservative is a naturally occurring or synthetically produced substance that is added to detergent compositions to prevent decomposition by microbial growth or by undesirable chemical changes. Preservatives can be divided into two types, depending on their origin. Class I preservatives refers to those preservatives which are naturally occurring, everyday substances.

Method of washing The second aspect of the invention is directed to methods of washing dishware with the composition of the present invention. Said method comprises the step of applying the composition, preferably in liquid form, onto the dishware surface, either in diluted or neat form and rinsing or leaving the composition to dry on the surface without rinsing the surface. By "in its neat form", it is meant herein that said composition is not diluted in a full sink of water. The composition is applied directly onto the surface to be treated and/or onto a cleaning device or implement such as a dish cloth, a sponge or a dish brush without undergoing major dilution (immediately) prior to the application. The cleaning device or implement is preferably wet before or after the composition is delivered to it. Especially good grease removal has been found when the composition is used in neat form. By "diluted form", it is meant herein that said composition is diluted by the user with an appropriate solvent, typically water. By "rinsing", it is meant herein contacting the dishware cleaned using a process according to the present invention with substantial quantities of appropriate solvent, typically water, after the step of applying the liquid composition herein onto said dishware. By "substantial quantities", it is meant usually about 1 to about 10 liters. The composition herein can be applied in its diluted form. Soiled dishes are contacted with an effective amount, typically from about 0.5 ml to about 20 ml (per about 25 dishes being treated), preferably from about 3ml to about 10 ml, of the detergent composition, preferably in liquid form, of the present invention diluted in water. The actual amount of detergent composition used will be based on the judgment of user, and will typically depend upon factors such as the particular product formulation of the composition, including the concentration of active ingredients in the composition, the number of soiled dishes to be cleaned, the degree of soiling on the dishes, and the like. Generally, from about 0.01 ml to about 150 ml, preferably from about 3ml to about 40ml of a liquid detergent composition of the invention is combined with from about 2000 ml to about 20000 ml, more typically from about 5000 ml to about 15000 ml of water in a sink having a volumetric capacity in the range of from about 1000 ml to about 20000 ml, more typically from about 5000 ml to about 15000 ml. The soiled dishes are immersed in the sink containing the diluted compositions then obtained, where contacting the soiled surface of the dish with a cloth, sponge, or similar article cleans them. The cloth, sponge, or similar article may be immersed in the detergent composition and water mixture prior to being contacted with the dish surface, and is typically contacted with the dish surface for a period of time ranged from about 1 to about 10 seconds, although the actual time will vary with each application and user. The contacting of cloth, sponge, or similar article to the dish surface is preferably accompanied by a concurrent scrubbing of the dish surface. Another method of the present invention will comprise immersing the soiled dishes into a water bath or held under running water without any liquid dishwashing detergent. A device for absorbing liquid dishwashing detergent, such as a sponge, is placed directly into a separate quantity of undiluted liquid dishwashing composition for a period of time typically ranging from about 1 to about 5 seconds. The absorbing device, and consequently the undiluted liquid dishwashing composition, is then contacted individually to the surface of each of the soiled dishes to remove said soiling. The absorbing device is typically contacted with each dish surface for a period of time range from about 1 to about 10 seconds, although the actual time of application will be dependent upon factors such as the degree of soiling of the dish. The contacting of the absorbing device to the dish surface is preferably accompanied by concurrent scrubbing. Alternatively, the device may be immersed in a mixture of the hand dishwashing composition and water prior to being contacted with the dish surface, the concentrated solution is made by diluting the hand dishwashing composition with water in a small container that can accommodate the cleaning device at weight ratios ranging from about 95:5 to about 5:95, preferably about 80:20 to about 20:80 and more preferably about 70:30 to about 30:70, respectively, of hand dishwashing liquid:water respectively depending upon the user habits and the cleaning task. Examples The grease cleaning performance of hand dishwashing detergent compositions with and without polyetheramines according to the invention was evaluated. As it can be seen from the results below, compositions comprising the polyetheramines of the invention provide considerably greater grease removal than the same compositions without the polyetheramine.

The analytical data of the reaction product is shown in the table below. The grease cleaning performance of the compositions was assessed by measuring the turbidity of wash solutions of the compositions upon contact with grease. Methodology Grease (beef fat) is liquefied by heating and small amounts are put in small glass vials and left at 4°C for at least 24 hours. The day before the test, the vials with the grease are put at 21°C to equilibrate. 5% wash solutions (water hardness: 14dH) of the hand dishwashing detergent compositions as shown in Table 1 are added to the vial containing the grease. Turbidity / absorbance of the wash solutions is measured over time at 25 °C, under mild stirring conditions via a small overhead stirrer. Cleaning indexes are calculated with reference to the compositions free of polyetheramine: (Absorbance of the test solution with polyetheramine / absorbance of the reference solution without polyetheramine) * 100. The higher the Cleaning Index, the better the grease cleaning performance of the polyetheramine. EXAMPLE 2 Following hand dishwashing detergent compositions were made: Dye, perfume and preservative NaOH to pH 9 (10% in demin water) Water to 100% Numbers in weight% of the formula PEI: alkoxylated polyethyleneimine polymer Table 2 Methodology Grease (beef fat) is liquefied by heating and polystyrene sticks coated with paraffin wax are dipped in the liquid grease, so that grease-covered sticks are obtained. The grease-covered sticks are stored at 4C for minimum 24 hours. For measuring the grease cleaning performance of the compositions, the grease-covered sticks are placed over a slightly moving/swirling microplate containing 10% wash solutions of the compositions (water hardness: 14dH). The grease-covered sticks are dipping into the test solutions without getting in contact with the walls or bottom of the microplate and are kept in the swirling test solutions during the wash time. The wash temperature is 30C. The turbidity of the test solutions is quantified via measuring the absorbance of the test solutions and from the measured absorbance the cleaning index is calculated: (Absorbance of the test solution with polyetheramine / absorbance of the reference solution without polyetheramine) * 100. The higher the Cleaning Index, the better the grease cleaning performance of the polyetheramine.
