Pim kinases in cancer: diagnostic, prognostic and treatment opportunities.
PIM proteins belong to a family of ser/thr kinases composed of 3 members, PIM1, PIM2 and PIM3, with greatly overlapping functions.
PIM kinases are mainly responsible for cell cycle regulation, antiapoptotic activity and the homing and migration of receptor tyrosine kinases mediated via the JAK/STAT pathway.
PIM kinases have been found to be upregulated in many hematological malignancies and solid tumors.
Although these kinases have been described as weak oncogenes, they are heavily targeted for anticancer drug discovery.
The present review summarizes the discoveries made to date regarding PIM kinases as driving oncogenes in the process of tumorigenesis and their validation as drug targets.
