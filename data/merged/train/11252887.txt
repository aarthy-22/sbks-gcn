Gemcitabine and Pemetrexed disodium in treating breast cancer.
Pemetrexed disodium (Alimta, LY231514) is a novel, multitargeted antifolate that inhibits thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate reductase, and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyl transferase.
This agent is broadly active in a wide variety of solid tumors, including breast cancer.
Pemetrexed disodium has also shown clinically relevant activity in combination with gemcitabine (Gemzar).
This combination is being evaluated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.
