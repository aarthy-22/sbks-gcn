Amino acid composition, antinutrients and allergens in the peanut protein fraction obtained by an aqueous enzymatic process.
Enzyme-assisted aqueous extraction (EAE) of peanut kernel was used to extract oil and protein.
The aqueous fraction (AF) obtained by EAE had a better essential amino acid profile than the residues obtained by solvent extraction (Rs) and cold pressing (Rc).
No major difference in the trypsin inhibitor activity among AF, Rs and Rc was observed; however, the trypsin inhibitor activity was drastically reduced in the residue obtained after EAE.
AF was subjected to MALDI-TOF/MS, revealing it to be rich in peptides (107) with molecular masses from m/z 700 to 2369Da.
AF had an extremely low phytate content and was rich in peptides, which could be used as a food supplement.
ESI-MS/MS data were used for the identification of major peanut allergens, viz., Ara h1, h3, h6-8.
Their allergenic potential needs to be established.
