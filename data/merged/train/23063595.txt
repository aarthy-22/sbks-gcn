Multifunctional targets of dietary polyphenols in disease: a case for the chemokine network and energy metabolism.
Chronic, non-acute inflammation is behind conditions that represent most of the disease burden in humans and is clearly linked to immune and metabolic mechanisms.
The convergence of pathways involving the immune response, oxidative stress, increased circulating lipids and aberrant insulin signaling results in CCL2-associated macrophage recruitment and altered energy metabolism.
The CCL2/CCR2 pathway and the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) are attractive therapeutic targets as a part of preventive management of disease.
Several effects of polyphenols are useful in this scenario, including a reduction in the activities of cytokines and modulation of cellular metabolism through histone deacetylase inhibitors, AMPK activators, calorie-restriction mimetics or epigenetic regulators.
Research is currently underway to develop orally active drugs with these effects, but it is convenient to examine more closely what we are eating.
If a lack of relevance in terms of toxicity and substantial effectiveness are confirmed, plant-derived components may provide useful druggable components and dietary supplements.
We consider therapeutic actions as a combination of synergistic and/or antagonistic interactions in a multi-target strategy.
Hence, improvement in food through enrichment with polyphenols with demonstrated activity may represent a major advance in the design of diets with both industrial and sanitary value.
