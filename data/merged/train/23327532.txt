Cooperative effects for CYP2E1 differ between styrene and its metabolites.
Abstract 1.
Cooperative interactions are frequently observed in the metabolism of drugs and pollutants by cytochrome P450s; nevertheless, the molecular determinants for cooperativity remain elusive.
Previously, we demonstrated that steady-state styrene metabolism by CYP2E1 exhibits positive cooperativity.

We hypothesized that styrene metabolites have lower affinity than styrene toward CYP2E1 and limited ability to induce cooperative effects during metabolism.
To test the hypothesis, we determined the potency and mechanism of inhibition for styrene and its metabolites toward oxidation of 4-nitrophenol using CYP2E1 Supersomes® and human liver microsomes.

Styrene inhibited the reaction through a mixed cooperative mechanism with high affinity for the catalytic site (67 µM) and lower affinity for the cooperative site (1100 µM), while increasing substrate turnover at high concentrations.
Styrene oxide and 4-vinylphenol possessed similar affinity for CYP2E1.
Styrene oxide behaved cooperatively like styrene, but 4-vinylphenol decreased turnover at high concentrations.
Styrene glycol was a very poor competitive inhibitor.
Among all compounds, there was a positive correlation with binding and hydrophobicity.

Taken together, these findings for CYP2E1 further validate contributions of cooperative mechanisms to metabolic processes, demonstrate the role of molecular structure on those mechanisms and underscore the potential for heterotropic cooperative effects between different compounds.
