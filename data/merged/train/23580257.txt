Anti-asthmatic Effects of Baicalin in a Mouse Model of Allergic Asthma.
The aim of the study was to investigate the anti-asthmatic effects of baicalin (BA) and the possible mechanisms.
Asthma model was established by ovalbumin (OVA) intraperitoneal injection.
A total of 60 mice were randomly assigned to six experimental groups: control, model, dexamethasone (2 mg/kg), and BA (10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg).
Airway resistance (RI) and lung compliance (Cdyn) were measured, histological studies were evaluated by the hematoxylin and eosin staining, Th1/Th2, OVA-specific serum, and BALF IgE levels and Th17 cytokines were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Th17 cells was evaluated by flow cytometry (FCM).
Our study demonstrated that BA inhibited OVA-induced increases in RI and eosinophil count; interleukin (IL)-4, IL-17A levels, and Cdyn were recovered and increased IFN-γ level in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
Histological studies demonstrated that BA substantially inhibited OVA-induced eosinophilia in lung tissue and airway tissue.
FCM studies demonstrated that BA substantially inhibited Th17 cells.
These findings suggest that BA may effectively ameliorate the progression of asthma and could be used as a therapy for patients with allergic asthma.
