Bioefficacy of EPA-DHA from lipids recovered from fish processing wastes through biotechnological approaches.
The effect of fish oil recovered from fish visceral waste (FVW-FO) on serum and liver lipids, activity of HMG-CoA reductase in liver microsomes and EPA+DHA incorporation in liver, heart and brain were evaluated.
Rats were fed different concentrations of FVW-FO providing 1.25%, 2.50%, 5.0% EPA+DHA recovered by either fermentation or enzymatic hydrolysis for 8weeks.
Feeding FVW-FO reduce triacylglycerols (5.96-20.3%), total cholesterol (7.9-21.5%) and LDL (7.39-21.7%) cholesterol levels in serum compared to group fed on a control diet (groundnut oil).
The activity of HMG-CoA reductase was reduced (p<0.05) in the FVW-FO fed groups compared to the control.
EPA+DHA level in serum, liver, brain and heart increased with increments in dietary EPA+DHA.
Results show the hypolipidemic property of FVW-FO and reduced HMG-CoA reductase activity which is proportional to the incorporation of EPA+DHA.
Recovery of FVW-FO will address the increasing demand for fish oil and reduce pollution problems.
