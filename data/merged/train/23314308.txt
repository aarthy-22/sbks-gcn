Electrical field stimulation (EFS)-induced relaxations turn into contractions upon removal of extracellular calcium in rat mesenteric artery.
In the present study, we aimed to examine the effect of blockade of L-type Ca(2+) channels (LTCC) and in addition the removal of extracellular Ca(2+), on EFS-induced relaxations in rings of rat mesenteric artery.
EFS applied to the tissues precontracted with phenylephrine caused relaxations which were markedly inhibited by nifedipine (10(-7)M) and tetraethylammonium (TEA) (1mM).
Addition of LTCC opener BAY K 8644 (10(-7)M) failed to enhance the relaxations.
Upon removal of Ca(2+), EFS with the same stimulation parameters produced frequency-dependent transient contractions.
Tetrodotoxin (10(-6)M), capsaicin (10(-5)M) and removal of endothelium did not alter these contractions suggesting that they were not neural in origin and endothelium-derived contracting factors were unlikely to be involved.
However, they were increased by nearly 40% in response to BAY K 8644 (10(-7)M) and were inhibited by nifedipine (10(-7)M), indicating that activation of the LTCCs was essential.
Inositol triphosphate (InsP3) receptor antagonist 2-APB (10(-4)M) significantly reduced, and high concentration of caffeine (20mM) almost totally suppressed the contractions.
These results suggest that in the absence of extracellular Ca(2+) EFS through membrane depolarization, evokes the opening of the LTCCs which subsequently leads to the release of Ca(2+) from internal stores via InsP3 receptors, a phenomenon known as Ca(2+) channel-induced Ca(2+) release (CCICR), to trigger vasoconstriction.
That activation of LTCCs causes arterial relaxation or contraction depending on the Ca(2+) status apparently exemplifies how the same messenger fulfils opposing physiological functions in a given cell.
