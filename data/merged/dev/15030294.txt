AT1-receptor antagonism in hypertension: what has been learned with irbesartan?
Irbesartan is a long-acting angiotensin II antagonist acting specifically at the level of the Type 1-receptor subtype (AT1-receptor).
This compound lowers blood pressure dose-dependently in hypertensive patients and has a placebo-like tolerability.
The antihypertensive efficacy of irbesartan is greatly enhanced by the coadministration of a diuretic, and fixed-dose combinations of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide are now available.
Irbesartan-based treatment appears especially effective for high-risk patients, such as those with diabetes, renal disease and cardiac hypertrophy.
In patients with Type 2 diabetes, irbesartan delays the development of nephropathy as well as the progression of renal failure.
Irbesartan may have antiatherosclerotic properties beyond those expected from blood pressure lowering per se: this AT1-blocker decreases the vascular oxidative stress and prevents the procoagulant as well as the pro-inflammatory effects of angiotensin II.
Irbesartan given alone or in combination with a diuretic therefore represents a rational approach to treat hypertensive patients.
