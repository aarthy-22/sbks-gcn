Desipramine administration in the olfactory bulbectomized rat: changes in brain beta-adrenoceptor and 5-HT2A binding sites and their relationship to behaviour.
1.
The effects of repeated administration of the tricyclic antidepressant drug, desipramine (DMI), on behaviour (locomotor activity and rearing) and the number and affinity of brain beta-adrenoceptor and 5-HT2A receptor binding sites were examined in olfactory bulbectomized (OB) and sham-operated control rats.
2.
Locomotor activity and rearing were increased in OB rats compared to sham-operated controls.
The effect of various doses of DMI (administered orally twice daily for 21 days) on these behavioural measures was examined.
A dose of 7.5 mg kg-1 provided optimal reversal of hyperlocomotion and increased rearing in OB rats, without changing these measures in sham-operated controls.
3.
The time course of DMI (7.5 mg kg-1) on behavioural and neurochemical measures was examined.
locomotion and rearing in OB rats were not significantly altered after 7 days, were significantly attenuated after 14 days and were normalized after 21 days.
4. After 7 days of DMI administration the number of beta-adrenoceptors was lower in frontal and occipital cortex and hippocampus.
This reduction was largely restricted to the beta 1-adrenoceptor subtype.
Administration of DMI for 14 or 21 days did not further reduce the number of beta-adrenoceptors.
The DMI induced reduction in beta-adrenoceptors did not differ in OB and sham-operated control rats.
5.
DMI administration for up to 21 days produced a progressive reduction in the number of 5-HT2A receptors in frontal cortex, without significant alterations in occipital cortex.
6.
The time course of the reduction in the number of 5-HT2A receptors was similar to that of the DMI-induced behavioural changes whereas that for the reduction in beta-adrenoceptors was clearly different.
7.
The present results suggest that the action of DMI in this animal model is unlikely to be directly related to a reduction in beta-adrenoceptors but may be related to a reduction in frontal cortical 5-HT2A receptors.
