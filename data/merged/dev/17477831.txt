Discovery of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase 2 inhibitors: comparison of a fluorescence intensity-based phosphate assay and a fluorescence polarization-based ADP Assay for high-throughput screening.
Acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) enzymes exist as two isoforms, ACC1 and ACC2, which play critical roles in fatty acid biosynthesis and oxidation.
Though each isoform differs in tissue and subcellular localization, both catalyze the biotin- and ATP-dependent carboxylation of acetyl-coenzyme A to generate malonyl-coenzyme A, a key metabolite in the control of fatty acid synthesis and oxidation.
The cytosolic ACC1 is expressed primarily in liver and adipose tissue, and uses malonyl-coenzyme A as a key building block in fatty acid biosynthesis.
The mitochondrial ACC2 is primarily expressed in heart and skeletal muscle, where it is involved in the regulation of fatty acid oxidation.
Inhibitors of ACC enzymes may therefore be useful therapeutics for diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome.
Two assay formats for these ATP-utilizing enzymes amenable to high-throughput screening are compared: a fluorescence intensity-based assay to detect inorganic phosphate and a fluorescence polarization-based assay to detect ADP.
Acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase inhibitors were identified by these high-throughput screening methods and were confirmed in a radiometric high performance liquid chromatography assay of malonyl-coenzyme A production.
