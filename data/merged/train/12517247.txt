Eprosartan for the treatment of hypertension.
Antihypertensive agents are proven to reduce the cardiovascular risk of stroke, coronary heart disease and cardiac failure.
The ideal antihypertensive agent should control all grades of hypertension and have a placebo-like side effect profile.
Angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonists are a relatively new class of antihypertensive agent that block AII Type 1 (AT(1)) receptors, and reduce the pressor effects of AII in the vasculature.
By this mechanism, they induce similar pharmacological effects compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, resulting in a lowering of blood pressure.
However, AII receptor blockers differ from ACE inhibitors with respect to side effects, and induce less cough, a side effect which may be related to bradykinin or other mediators such as substance P. Within the class of AII blockers, eprosartan differs from other currently available agents in terms of chemical structure, as it is a non-biphenyl, non-tetrazole, non-peptide antagonist with a dual pharmacological mode of action.
Eprosartan acts at vascular AT(1) receptors (postsynaptically) and at presynaptic AT(1) receptors, where it inhibits sympathetically stimulated noradrenaline release.
Its lack of metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes confers a low potential for metabolic drug interactions and may be of importance when treating elderly patients and those on multiple drugs.
In clinical trials, eprosartan has been demonstrated to be at least as effective in reducing blood pressure as the ACE inhibitor enalapril, and has significantly lower side effects.
Eprosartan is safe, effective and well-tolerated in long-term treatment, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs such as hydrochlorothiazide.
