Mitochondrial creatine kinase from chicken brain.
Purification, biophysical characterization, and generation of heterodimeric and heterooctameric molecules with subunits of other creatine kinase isoenzymes.
In a recent study it has been shown that mitochondrial creatine kinase from chicken brain (Mia-CK) and heart (Mib-CK) are two distinct isoenzymes differing in ten out of the thirty N-terminal amino acids (Hossle, J.P., Schlegel, J., Wegmann, G., Wyss, M., Bohlen, P., Eppenberger, H.M., Wallimann, T., and Perriard J.C.

The present article describes the purification and biophysical characterization of the mitochondrial creatine kinase isoenzyme from chicken brain (Mia-CK).
Gel permeation chromatography, direct mass measurements of individual molecules by scanning transmission electron microscopy, and analytical ultracentrifugation confirmed the existence of two different oligomeric forms, dimeric and octameric Mia-CK, with molecular masses of 85 kDa and 306-352 kDa and with sedimentation constants of 4.9-5.3 and 11.6-12.0 S, respectively.
In addition, it was tested if Mia- and Mib-CK can form heterodimeric and heterooctameric molecules with subunits of other CK isoenzymes.
By denaturation in urea or guanidine hydrochloride and subsequent renaturation, MiaMib-CK and surprisingly also MiaM-CK heterodimers could be generated.
In contrast, no heterodimers were obtained between Mib- and M- or B-CK.
Furthermore, reoctamerization of a mixture of Mia- and Mib-CK homodimers led to the formation of MiaMib-CK heterooctamers.
In these heterooctamers, the Mia- and Mib-CK homodimers remained the fundamental building blocks.
No subunit exchange between adjacent dimers within the heterooctamer could be observed even after storage for 3 months at 4 degrees C. The relevance of these data on the structural organization of the Mi-CK octamer and on the physiological aspects of tissue-specific isoenzyme expression are discussed.
