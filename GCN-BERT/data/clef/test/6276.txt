TECHNICAL FIELD The disclosure provided herein relates to rat monoclonal antibodies specific for TEM-1 and methods of producing and using the described antibodies. BACKGROUND Angiogenesis is a regulated process involving the formation of new blood vessels. It plays an essential role in normal growth, embryonic development, wound healing, and other physiological processes (Yancopoulos et al. (2000) Nature 407(6801):242-8). Moreover, de novo angiogenesis is involved in several disease states including cancer, where the formation of new “embryonic-like” blood vessels (referred to as neovascularization herein) appear that differ from normal vasculature with regards to structure and function (Hanahan and Weinberg (2000) Cell 100(1):57-70). A number of in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated biological differences between normal and disease-associated vasculature as determined using various model systems of angiogenesis offering the ability to develop novel anti-angiogenic compounds that can selectively inhibit vessel formation of the embryonic-type, tumor-associated endothelial-type for therapy of neovascular disease. In light of these opportunities for therapy, an intense search for potential targets that can specifically inhibit tumor and other neovascular disease-associated endothelial cell growth and function is ongoing. In an attempt to identify such targets, strategies have been designed to identify cell surface antigens of tumor stroma as well as isolate specific proteins or RNA that are expressed in neovascular endothelial cells (Rettig et al. (1992) PNAS 89(22):10832-6; St. Croix et al. (2000) Science 289: 1197-1202). These strategies have identified a cell surface protein called tumor endothelial marker 1 (TEM-1), also known as endosialin or CD248. TEM-1 is expressed on tumor-associated pericytes, tumor stromal cells and directly on a subset of malignant cells. Pericytes are specialized cells that support the formation of blood vessels that support blood to tumors for their growth and survival. Expression of TEM-1 in tumors has been observed by several independent laboratories and experiments, and blocking endosialin function has been shown to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. In cancer it is believed that neovascularization is important to supply tumors with blood, providing nutrients to support largely uncontrolled growth. Thus, proteins, such as TEM-1, that are differentially associated with tumor vasculature have become potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of cancer. The development of antibodies that can specifically target TEM-1 offers the ability to treat these diseases. It is also understood that earlier detection of cancer improves survival rates and quality of life. To improve the likelihood of early detection and effective treatment, a need exists for non-invasive methods for detecting cancers, monitoring existing cancers, and assessing therapeutic efficacy. SUMMARY Provided herein are antibodies that bind to TEM-1. Also described are related polynucleotides capable of encoding the provided antibodies, cells expressing the provided antibodies, as well as associated vectors and detectable antibody labels. In addition, methods of using the provided antibodies are described. For example, the provided antibodies may be used to diagnose cancer; monitor cancer progression, regression, or stable disease; to determine whether or not a patient should be treated for cancer, or to determine whether or not a subject is afflicted with TEM-1-expressing cancer and thus may be amenable to treatment with a TEM-1-specific anti-cancer therapeutic. TEM-1-Specific Antibodies Described herein are isolated antibodies and antigen-binding fragments specific for TEM-1. In some embodiments, the antibodies or antigen-binding fragments are rat IgG, or derivatives thereof. In some embodiments the described antibodies are capable of binding to TEM-1 with a dissociation constant of 1×10−8 M or less.

Vectors comprising the described polynucleotides are also provided, as are cells expressing the antibodies provided herein. Also described are cells capable of expressing the disclosed vectors. These cells may be mammalian cells (such as CHO-K1 cells), insect cells (such as Sf7 cells), yeast cells, plant cells, or bacteria cells (such as E. coli). The described antibodies may also be produced by hybridoma cells, as described herein. Methods of Using TEM-1-Specific Antibodies Methods of using the described antibodies are also disclosed. For example, these antibodies may be useful for detecting the presence of TEM-1 in a biological sample, such as blood or serum; for quantifying the amount of TEM-1 in a biological sample, such as blood or serum; for diagnosing TEM-1-expressing cancer; determining a method of treating a subject afflicted with cancer; or monitoring the progression of cancer in a subject. In some embodiments, TEM-1-expressing cancer may be melanoma, sarcoma, bladder cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular cancer, or colon cancer. The described methods may be carried out before the subject receives treatment for TEM-1-expressing cancer, such as treatment with MORAb-004. Furthermore, the described methods may be carried out after the subject receives treatment for TEM-1-expressing cancer, such as treatment with MORAb-004. In this regard, the methods described herein may be carried out using one or more antibodies, or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, that does not compete with MORAb-004 for binding to TEM-1, such as antibodies 9G5 and 15F8. The described methods of detecting TEM-1 in a biological sample include exposing the biological sample to one or more of the TEM-1-specific antibodies described herein. The described methods of diagnosing TEM-1-expressing cancer in a subject also involve exposing the biological sample to one or more of the TEM-1-specific antibodies described herein; however, the methods also include quantifying the amount of TEM-1 present in the sample; comparing the amount of TEM-1 present in the sample to a known standard or reference sample; and determining whether the subject's TEM-1 levels fall within the levels of TEM-1 associated with cancer. The methods for treating a subject afflicted with TEM-1-expressing cancer provided herein are similar to those for diagnosing TEM-1-expressing cancer, but differ in that the former includes the further step of administering to the subject, or prescribing, a treatment for the cancer. In some embodiments, the treatment for cancer may be a TEM-1-specific antibody, such as MORAb-004. Also described herein are methods of monitoring TEM-1-expressing cancer in a subject. The described methods include exposing the biological sample to one or more of the TEM-1-specific antibodies described herein; quantifying the amount of TEM-1 present in the sample that is bound by the antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof; comparing the amount of TEM-1 present in the sample to either a known standard or reference sample or the amount of TEM-1 in a similar sample previously obtained from the subject; and determining whether the subject's TEM-1 levels are indicative of cancer progression, regression or stable disease based on the difference in the amount of TEM-1 in the compared samples. The samples obtained, or derived from, subjects are biological samples such as urine, blood, serum, plasma, saliva, ascites, circulating cells, circulating tumor cells, cells that are not tissue associated, tissues, surgically resected tumor tissue, biopsies, fine needle aspiration samples, or histological preparations. The described antibodies may be labeled for use with the described methods, or other methods known to those skilled in the art. For example, the antibodies described herein, or antigen-binding fragments thereof, may be labeled with a radiolabel, a fluorescent label, an epitope tag, biotin, a chromophore label, an ECL label, an enzyme, ruthenium, 111In-DOTA, 111In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase and beta-galactosidase, or poly-histidine or similar such labels known in the art. Kits Described herein are kits including the disclosed antibodies. The described kits may be used to carry out the methods of using the antibodies provided herein, or other methods known to those skilled in the art. In some embodiments the described kits may include the antibodies described herein and reagents for use in detecting the presence of TEM-1 in a biological sample. Accordingly, the described kits may include one or more of the antibodies, or an antigen-binding fragment(s) thereof, described herein and a vessel for containing the antibody or fragment when not in use, instructions for use of the antibody or fragment, the antibody or fragment affixed to a solid support, or detectably labeled forms of the antibody or fragment, as described herein. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1—Depicted are Western blots of cell lysates from either aortic smooth muscle cells (S), which are known to express TEM-1, or human umbilical vein endothelial cells (H), which do not express TEM-1. The blots were probed separately with the indicated monoclonal rat antibody specific for TEM-1. FIG. 2—Images of TEM-1 distribution, as detected by antibody 9G5, on histological samples from subjects having bladder cancer (A), liposarcoma (B), melanoma (C), fibromyxosarcoma (D), melanoma (E), leimyosarcoma (F), hepatocellular cancer (G), gastric cancer (H), or colorectal cancer (I) are shown. FIG. 3—Depicted is a Western blot of TEM-1 immunoprecipitated from human serum obtained from melanoma patients.

A graphical representation of the statistical variation of the samples is also provided. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS The following description characterizes antibodies, and antigen-binding fragments thereof, that specifically bind to TEM-1. Also described are related polynucleotides capable of encoding these antibodies, and antigen-binding fragments, cells expressing the antibodies, and antigen-binding fragments, as well as associated vectors and detectable antibody labels. In addition, methods of using the antibodies, and antigen-binding fragments, are described. For example, the provided antibodies, and antigen-binding fragments, may be used to detect TEM-1 in a biological sample, diagnose TEM-1-expressing cancer; monitor TEM-1-expressing cancer progression, regression, or stable disease; to determine whether or not a patient should be treated for cancer, or to determine whether or not a subject is afflicted with TEM-1-expressing cancer and thus may be amenable to treatment with a therapeutic agent directed against TEM-1. In some embodiments TEM-1-expressing cancer includes melanoma, sarcoma, bladder cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular cancer, or colon cancer. DEFINITIONS Various terms relating to aspects of the description are used throughout the specification and claims. Such terms are to be given their ordinary meaning in the art unless otherwise indicated. Other specifically defined terms are to be construed in a manner consistent with the definitions provided herein. As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” “an,” and “the” include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to “a cell” includes a combination of two or more cells, and the like. The term “about” as used herein when referring to a measurable value such as an amount, a temporal duration, and the like, is meant to encompass variations of up to ±10% from the specified value, as such variations are appropriate to perform the disclosed methods. Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, properties such as molecular weight, reaction conditions, and so forth used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term “about.” Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the following specification and attached claims are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques. Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however, inherently contains certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements. “Isolated” means a biological component (such as a nucleic acid, peptide or protein) has been substantially separated, produced apart from, or purified away from other biological components of the organism in which the component naturally occurs, i.e., other chromosomal and extrachromosomal DNA and RNA, and proteins. Nucleic acids, peptides and proteins that have been “isolated” thus include nucleic acids and proteins purified by standard purification methods. “Isolated” nucleic acids, peptides and proteins that can be part of a composition and still be isolated if such composition is not part of the native environment of the nucleic acid, peptide, or protein. The term also embraces nucleic acids, peptides and proteins prepared by recombinant expression in a host cell as well as chemically synthesized nucleic acids. “Polynucleotide,” synonymously referred to as “nucleic acid molecule,” “nucleotides” or “nucleic acids,” refers to any polyribonucleotide or polydeoxyribonucleotide, which may be unmodified RNA or DNA or modified RNA or DNA. “Polynucleotides” include, without limitation single- and double-stranded DNA, DNA that is a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, single- and double-stranded RNA, and RNA that is mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, hybrid molecules comprising DNA and RNA that may be single-stranded or, more typically, double-stranded or a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions. In addition, “polynucleotide” refers to triple-stranded regions comprising RNA or DNA or both RNA and DNA. The term polynucleotide also includes DNAs or RNAs containing one or more modified bases and DNAs or RNAs with backbones modified for stability or for other reasons. “Modified” bases include, for example, tritylated bases and unusual bases such as inosine. A variety of modifications may be made to DNA and RNA; thus, “polynucleotide” embraces chemically, enzymatically or metabolically modified forms of polynucleotides as typically found in nature, as well as the chemical forms of DNA and RNA characteristic of viruses and cells. “Polynucleotide” also embraces relatively short nucleic acid chains, often referred to as oligonucleotides. The meaning of “substantially the same” can differ depending on the context in which the term is used. Because of the natural sequence variation likely to exist among heavy and light chains and the genes encoding them, one would expect to find some level of variation within the amino acid sequences or the genes encoding the antibodies or antigen-binding fragments described herein, with little or no impact on their unique binding properties (e.g., specificity and affinity). Such an expectation is due in part to the degeneracy of the genetic code, as well as to the evolutionary success of conservative amino acid sequence variations, which do not appreciably alter the nature of the encoded protein. Accordingly, in the context of nucleic acid sequences, “substantially the same” means at least 65% identity between two or more sequences. Preferably, the term refers to at least 70% identity between two or more sequences, more preferably at least 75% identity, more preferably at least 80% identity, more preferably at least 85% identity, more preferably at least 90% identity, more preferably at least 91% identity, more preferably at least 92% identity, more preferably at least 93% identity, more preferably at least 94% identity, more preferably at least 95% identity, more preferably at least 96% identity, more preferably at least 97% identity, more preferably at least 98% identity, and more preferably at least 99% or greater identity. Such identity may be determined using nBLAST algorithm (Altschul et al., (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:2264-8; Karlin and Altschul (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5873-7). The degree of variation that may occur within the amino acid sequence of a protein without having a substantial effect on protein function is much lower than that of a nucleic acid sequence, since the same degeneracy principles do not apply to amino acid sequences. Accordingly, in the context of an antibody or antigen-binding fragment, “substantially the same” means antibodies or antigen-binding fragments having 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identity to the antibodies or antigen-binding fragments described. Other embodiments include TEM-1 specific antibodies, or antigen-binding fragments, that have framework, scaffold, or other non-binding regions that do not share significant identity with the antibodies and antigen-binding fragments described herein, but do incorporate one or more CDRs or other sequences needed to confer binding that are 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99° A identical to such sequences described herein. A “vector” is a replicon, such as plasmid, phage, cosmid, or virus in which another nucleic acid segment may be operably inserted so as to bring about the replication or expression of the segment. A “clone” is a population of cells derived from a single cell or common ancestor by mitosis. A “cell line” is a clone of a primary cell that is capable of stable growth in vitro for many generations. In some examples provided herein, cells are transformed by transfecting the cells with DNA. The terms “express” and “produce” are used synonymously herein, and refer to the biosynthesis of a gene product. These terms encompass the transcription of a gene into RNA. These terms also encompass translation of RNA into one or more polypeptides, and further encompass all naturally occurring post-transcriptional and post-translational modifications. The expression or production of an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof may be within the cytoplasm of the cell, or into the extracellular milieu such as the growth medium of a cell culture. The terms “treating” or “treatment” refer to any success or indicia of success in the attenuation or amelioration of an injury, pathology or condition, including any objective or subjective parameter such as abatement, remission, diminishing of symptoms or making the condition more tolerable to the patient, slowing in the rate of degeneration or decline, making the final point of degeneration less debilitating, improving a subject's physical or mental well-being, or prolonging the length of survival. The treatment may be assessed by objective or subjective parameters; including the results of a physical examination, neurological examination, or psychiatric evaluations. “Antibody” refers to all isotypes of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgE, IgM, IgD, and IgY) including various monomeric, polymeric and chimeric forms, unless otherwise specified. Antigen-binding fragments are any proteinaceous structure that may exhibit binding affinity for a particular antigen. Some antigen-binding fragments are composed of portions of intact antibodies that retain antigen-binding specificity of the parent antibody molecule. For example, antigen-binding fragments may comprise at least one variable region (either a heavy chain or light chain variable region) or one or more CDRs of an antibody known to bind a particular antigen. Examples of suitable antigen-binding fragments include, without limitation diabodies and single-chain molecules as well as Fab, F(ab′)2, Fc, Fabc, and Fv molecules, single chain (Sc) antibodies, individual antibody light chains, individual antibody heavy chains, chimeric fusions between antibody chains or CDRs and other proteins, protein scaffolds, heavy chain monomers or dimers, light chain monomers or dimers, dimers consisting of one heavy and one light chain, and the like. All antibody isotypes may be used to produce antigen-binding fragments. Additionally, antigen-binding fragments may include non-antibody proteinaceous frameworks that may successfully incorporate polypeptide segments in an orientation that confers affinity for a given antigen of interest, such as protein scaffolds. Antigen-binding fragments may be recombinantly produced or produced by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact antibodies. The phrase “an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof” may be used to denote that a given antigen-binding fragment incorporates one or more amino acid segments of the antibody referred to in the phrase. “Specific binding” when used in the context of antibodies, or antibody fragments, represents binding via domains encoded by immunoglobulin genes or fragments of immunoglobulin genes to one or more epitopes of a protein of interest, without preferentially binding other molecules in a sample containing a mixed population of molecules. Typically, an antibody binds to a cognate antigen with a Kd of less than about 1×10−8 M, as measured by a surface plasmon resonance assay or a cell binding assay. Phrases such as “[antigen]-specific” antibody (e.g., TEM-1-specific antibody) are meant to convey that the recited antibody specifically binds the recited antigen. The term “subject” refers to human and non-human animals, including all vertebrates, e.g., mammals and non-mammals, such as non-human primates, mice, rabbits, sheep, dogs, cats, horses, cows, chickens, amphibians, and reptiles. In many embodiments of the described methods, the subject is a human. The term “sample” as used herein refers to a collection of similar fluids, cells, or tissues (e.g., surgically resected tumor tissue, biopsies, including fine needle aspiration), isolated from a subject, as well as fluids, cells, or tissues present within a subject. In some embodiments the sample is a biological fluid. Biological fluids are typically liquids at physiological temperatures and may include naturally occurring fluids present in, withdrawn from, expressed or otherwise extracted from a subject or biological source. Certain biological fluids derive from particular tissues, organs or localized regions and certain other biological fluids may be more globally or systemically situated in a subject or biological source. Examples of biological fluids include blood, serum and serosal fluids, plasma, lymph, urine, saliva, cystic fluid, tear drops, feces, sputum, mucosal secretions of the secretory tissues and organs, vaginal secretions, ascites fluids such as those associated with non-solid tumors, fluids of the pleural, pericardial, peritoneal, abdominal and other body cavities, fluids collected by bronchial lavage and the like. Biological fluids may also include liquid solutions contacted with a subject or biological source, for example, cell and organ culture medium including cell or organ conditioned medium, lavage fluids and the like. The term “sample,” as used herein, encompasses materials removed from a subject or materials present in a subject. A “known standard” may be a solution having a known amount or concentration of TEM-1, where the solution may be a naturally occurring solution, such as a sample from a patient known to have early, moderate, late, progressive, or static cancer, or the solution may be a synthetic solution such as buffered water having a known amount of TEM-1 diluted therein. The known standards, described herein may include TEM-1 isolated from a subject, recombinant or purified TEM-1 protein, or a value of TEM-1 concentration associated with a disease condition. A “reference sample” is a sample that may be compared against another sample, such as a test sample, to allow for characterization of the compared sample. The reference sample will have some characterized property that serves as the basis for comparison with the test sample. For instance, a reference sample may be used as a benchmark for TEM-1 levels that are indicative of a subject having cancer. The reference sample does not necessarily have to be analyzed in parallel with the test sample, thus in some instances the reference sample may be a numerical value or range previously determined to characterize a given condition, such as TEM-1 levels that are indicative of cancer in a subject. The term also includes samples used for comparative purposes that are known to be associated with a physiologic state or disease condition, such as TEM-1-expressing cancer, but that have an unknown amount of TEM-1. The term “progression,” as used in the context of progression of TEM-1-expressing cancer, includes the change of a cancer from a less severe to a more severe state. This may include an increase in the number or severity of tumors, the degree of metastasis, the speed with which the cancer is growing or spreading, and the like. For example, “the progression of colon cancer” includes the progression of such a cancer from a less severe to a more severe state, such as the progression from stage I to stage II, from stage II to stage III, etc. The term “regression,” as used in the context of regression of TEM-1-expressing cancer, includes the change of a cancer from a more severe to a less severe state. This could include a decrease in the number or severity of tumors, the degree of metastasis, the speed with which the cancer is growing or spreading, and the like. For example, “the regression of colon cancer” includes the regression of such a cancer from a more severe to a less severe state, such as the progression from stage III to stage II, from stage II to stage I, etc. The term “stable” as used in the context of stable TEM-1-expressing cancer, is intended to describe a disease condition that is not, or has not, changed significantly enough over a clinically relevant period of time to be considered a progressing cancer or a regressing cancer. The terms “colon cancer” and “colorectal cancer” are used interchangeably herein. The embodiments described herein are not limited to particular methods, reagents, compounds, compositions or biological systems, which can, of course, vary. TEM-1-Specific Antibodies and Antigen-Binding Fragments Described herein are isolated monoclonal antibodies or antigen-binding fragments that specifically bind TEM-1. The general structure of an antibody molecule comprises an antigen binding domain, which includes heavy and light chains, and the Fc domain, which serves a variety of functions, including complement fixation and binding antibody receptors. The described antibodies or antigen-binding fragments include all isotypes, IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, and synthetic multimers of the four-chain immunoglobulin structure. The described antibodies or antigen-binding fragments also include the IgY isotype generally found in hen or turkey serum and hen or turkey egg yolk. The antibodies or antigen-binding fragments disclosed in the examples section are derived from rats. Similar antibodies may be derived from any species by recombinant means. For example, the antibodies or antigen-binding fragments may be mouse, goat, horse, swine, bovine, chicken, rabbit, camelid, donkey, human, or chimeric versions thereof. For use in administration to humans, non-human derived antibodies or antigen-binding fragments may be genetically or structurally altered to be less antigenic upon administration to a human patient. In some embodiments, the antibodies or antigen-binding fragments are chimeric. As used herein, the term “chimeric” refers to an antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, having at least some portion of at least one variable domain derived from the antibody amino acid sequence of a non-human mammal, a rodent, or a reptile, while the remaining portions of the antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, are derived from a human. For example, a chimeric antibody may comprise a rat antigen binding domain with a human Fc or other such structural domain. In some embodiments, the antibodies are humanized antibodies. Humanized antibodies may be chimeric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)2 or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a complementary-determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat or rabbit having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the framework regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody may include at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. The antibodies or antigen-binding fragments described herein can occur in a variety of forms, but will include one or more of the antibody variable domain segments or CDRs shown in Table 2. The isotypes of the antibodies described in Table 2 are shown in parentheses to describe the constant region of each antibody, which are known to have conserved sequences.

The antibodies or antigen-binding fragments described herein may embody several antibody isotypes, such as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA and IgE. Antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof specificity is largely determined by the amino acid sequence, and arrangement, of the CDRs. Therefore, the CDRs of one isotype may be transferred to another isotype without altering antigen specificity.

Accordingly, such antibody isotypes are within the scope of the described antibodies or antigen-binding fragments.

In one embodiment the antibody 7D3 has an affinity for TEM-1 of about 7×10−11 M to about 7×10−12 M. The affinity of the described antibodies, or antigen-binding fragments, may be determined by a variety of methods know in the art, such as surface plasmon resonance or ELISA-based methods. Also provided are vectors comprising the polynucleotides described herein. The vectors can be expression vectors. Recombinant expression vectors containing a sequence encoding a polypeptide of interest are thus contemplated as within the scope of this disclosure. The expression vector may contain one or more additional sequences such as but not limited to regulatory sequences (e.g., promoter, enhancer), a selection marker, and a polyadenylation signal. Vectors for transforming a wide variety of host cells are well known and include, but are not limited to, plasmids, phagemids, cosmids, baculoviruses, bacmids, bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs), as well as other bacterial, yeast and viral vectors. Recombinant expression vectors within the scope of the description include synthetic, genomic, or cDNA-derived nucleic acid fragments that encode at least one recombinant protein which may be operably linked to suitable regulatory elements. Such regulatory elements may include a transcriptional promoter, sequences encoding suitable mRNA ribosomal binding sites, and sequences that control the termination of transcription and translation. Expression vectors, especially mammalian expression vectors, may also include one or more nontranscribed elements such as an origin of replication, a suitable promoter and enhancer linked to the gene to be expressed, other 5′ or 3′ flanking nontranscribed sequences, 5′ or 3′ nontranslated sequences (such as necessary ribosome binding sites), a polyadenylation site, splice donor and acceptor sites, or transcriptional termination sequences. An origin of replication that confers the ability to replicate in a host may also be incorporated. The transcriptional and translational control sequences in expression vectors to be used in transforming vertebrate cells may be provided by viral sources. Exemplary vectors may be constructed as described by Okayama and Berg, 3 Mol. Cell. Biol. 280 (1983). In some embodiments, the antibody- or antigen-binding fragment-coding sequence is placed under control of a powerful constitutive promoter, such as the promoters for the following genes: hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT), adenosine deaminase, pyruvate kinase, beta-actin, human myosin, human hemoglobin, human muscle creatine, and others. In addition, many viral promoters function constitutively in eukaryotic cells and are suitable for use with the described embodiments. Such viral promoters include without limitation, Cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate early promoter, the early and late promoters of SV40, the Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV) promoter, the long terminal repeats (LTRs) of Maloney leukemia virus, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV), and other retroviruses, and the thymidine kinase promoter of Herpes Simplex Virus. In one embodiment, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof coding sequence is placed under control of an inducible promoter such as the metallothionein promoter, tetracycline-inducible promoter, doxycycline-inducible promoter, promoters that contain one or more interferon-stimulated response elements (ISRE) such as protein kinase R 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetases, Mx genes, ADAR1, and the like. Vectors described herein may contain one or more Internal Ribosome Entry Site(s) (IRES). Inclusion of an IRES sequence into fusion vectors may be beneficial for enhancing expression of some proteins. In some embodiments the vector system will include one or more polyadenylation sites (e.g., SV40), which may be upstream or downstream of any of the aforementioned nucleic acid sequences. Vector components may be contiguously linked, or arranged in a manner that provides optimal spacing for expressing the gene products (i.e., by the introduction of “spacer” nucleotides between the ORFs), or positioned in another way. Regulatory elements, such as the IRES motif, may also be arranged to provide optimal spacing for expression. The vectors may comprise selection markers, which are well known in the art. Selection markers include positive and negative selection markers, for example, antibiotic resistance genes (e.g., neomycin resistance gene, a hygromycin resistance gene, a kanamycin resistance gene, a tetracycline resistance gene, a penicillin resistance gene), glutamate synthase genes, HSV-TK, HSV-TK derivatives for ganciclovir selection, or bacterial purine nucleoside phosphorylase gene for 6-methylpurine selection (Gadi et al., 7 Gene Ther. 1738-1743 (2000)). A nucleic acid sequence encoding a selection marker or the cloning site may be upstream or downstream of a nucleic acid sequence encoding a polypeptide of interest or cloning site. The vectors described herein may be used to transform various cells with the genes encoding the described antibodies or antigen-binding fragments. For example, the vectors may be used to generate antibody or antigen-binding fragment-producing cells. Thus, another aspect features host cells transformed with vectors comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that specifically binds TEM-1, such as the antibodies or antigen-binding fragments described and exemplified herein. Numerous techniques are known in the art for the introduction of foreign genes into cells and may be used to construct the recombinant cells for purposes of carrying out the described methods, in accordance with the various embodiments described and exemplified herein. The technique used should provide for the stable transfer of the heterologous gene sequence to the host cell, such that the heterologous gene sequence is heritable and expressible by the cell progeny, and so that the necessary development and physiological functions of the recipient cells are not disrupted. Techniques which may be used include but are not limited to chromosome transfer (e.g., cell fusion, chromosome mediated gene transfer, micro cell mediated gene transfer), physical methods (e.g., transfection, spheroplast fusion, microinjection, electroporation, liposome carrier), viral vector transfer (e.g., recombinant DNA viruses, recombinant RNA viruses) and the like (described in Cline, 29 Pharmac. Ther. 69-92 (1985)). Calcium phosphate precipitation and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induced fusion of bacterial protoplasts with mammalian cells may also be used to transform cells. Cells suitable for use in the expression of the antibodies or antigen-binding fragments described herein are preferably eukaryotic cells, more preferably cells of plant, rodent, or human origin, for example but not limited to NSO, CHO, CHOK1, perC.6, Tk-ts13, BHK, HEK293 cells, COS-7, T98G, CV-1/EBNA, L cells, C127, 3T3, HeLa, NS1, Sp2/0 myeloma cells, and BHK cell lines, among others. In addition, expression of antibodies may be accomplished using hybridoma cells. Methods for producing hybridomas are well established in the art. Cells transformed with expression vectors described herein may be selected or screened for recombinant expression of the antibodies or antigen-binding fragments described herein. Recombinant-positive cells are expanded and screened for subclones exhibiting a desired phenotype, such as high level expression, enhanced growth properties, or the ability to yield proteins with desired biochemical characteristics, for example, due to protein modification or altered post-translational modifications. These phenotypes may be due to inherent properties of a given subclone or to mutation. Mutations may be effected through the use of chemicals, UV-wavelength light, radiation, viruses, insertional mutagens, inhibition of DNA mismatch repair, or a combination of such methods. Methods of Detecting TEM-1 Provided herein are methods for detecting TEM-1 in a biological sample by contacting the sample with an antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, described herein.

In some embodiments the sample may be contacted with more than one of the antibodies or antigen-binding fragments described herein. For example, a sample may be contacted with a first antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, and then contacted with a second antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, wherein the first antibody or antigen-binding fragment and the second antibody or antigen-binding fragment are not the same antibody or antigen-binding fragment. In some embodiments, the first antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, may be affixed to a surface, such as a multiwell plate, chip, or similar substrate prior to contacting the sample. In other embodiments the first antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, may not be affixed, or attached, to anything at all prior to contacting the sample. Various combinations of the antibodies, or antigen-binding fragments thereof, may be used to detect TEM-1 in a biological sample, as described in Table 4. In addition to MORAb-004 serving as one of two antibodies in a TEM-1 binding assay, as shown in Table 4, many of the combinations not involving MORAb-004 provided in Table 4 may be used in the presence of MORAb-004, because these antibodies do not compete with MORAb-004 for binding to TEM-1. For example, the combination of antibodies 9G5 and 15F8 may be used to detect, and quantify, TEM-1 in the presence of MORAb-004, because these antibodies do not compete with MORAb-004 for binding to TEM-1.

In some embodiments labeled antibodies and antigen-binding fragments may facilitate the detection TEM-1 via the methods described herein. Many such labels are readily known to those skilled in the art. For example, suitable labels include, but should not be considered limited to, radiolabels, fluorescent labels, epitope tags, biotin, chromophore labels, ECL labels, or enzymes. More specifically, the described labels include ruthenium, 111In-DOTA, 111In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase and beta-galactosidase, poly-histidine (HIS tag), acridine dyes, cyanine dyes, fluorone dyes, oxazin dyes, phenanthridine dyes, rhodamine dyes, Alexafluor® dyes, and the like. The described antibodies and antigen-binding fragments may be used in a variety of assays to detect TEM-1 in a biological sample. Some suitable assays include, but should not be considered limited to, western blot analysis, radioimmunoassay, surface plasmon resonance, immunofluorimetry, immunoprecipitation, equilibrium dialysis, immunodiffusion, electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunoassay, immunohistochemistry, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or ELISA assay. In some embodiments described herein detection of TEM-1-expressing cancer cells in a subject may be used to determine that the subject may be treated with a therapeutic agent directed against TEM-1. TEM-1 is present at detectable levels in blood and serum samples. Thus, provided herein are methods for detecting TEM-1 in a sample derived from blood, such as a serum sample, by contacting the sample with an antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, or ligand that specifically binds TEM-1. The blood sample, or a derivative thereof, may be diluted, fractionated, or otherwise processed to yield a sample upon which the described method may be performed. In some embodiments, TEM-1 may be detected in a blood sample, or a derivative thereof, by any number of assays known in the art, such as, but not limited to, western blot analysis, radioimmunoassay, surface plasmon resonance, immunofluorimetry, immunoprecipitation, equilibrium dialysis, immunodiffusion, electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunoassay, immunohistochemistry, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or ELISA assay. Methods for Diagnosing Cancer Provided herein are methods for diagnosing TEM-1-expressing cancer in a subject. In some embodiments TEM-1-expressing cancer includes melanoma, sarcoma, bladder cancer or colon cancer. In some embodiments, as described above, detecting TEM-1 in a biological sample, such as a blood sample or a serum sample, provides the ability to diagnose cancer in the subject from whom the sample was obtained. Alternatively, in some embodiments other samples such as a histological sample, a fine needle aspirate sample, resected tumor tissue, circulating cells, circulating tumor cells, and the like, may also be used to assess whether the subject from whom the sample was obtained has cancer. In some embodiments, it may already be known that the subject from whom the sample was obtained has cancer, but the type of cancer afflicting the subject may not yet have been diagnosed or a preliminary diagnosis may be unclear, thus detecting TEM-1 in a biological sample obtained from the subject can allow for, or clarify, diagnosis of the cancer. For example, a subject may be known to have cancer, but it may not be known, or may be unclear, whether the subject's cancer is TEM-1-expressing. In some embodiments the described methods involve assessing whether a subject is afflicted with TEM-1-expressing cancer by determining the amount of TEM-1 that is present in a biological sample derived from the subject; and comparing the observed amount of TEM-1 with the amount of TEM-1 in a control, or reference, sample, wherein a difference between the amount of TEM-1 in the sample derived from the subject and the amount of TEM-1 in the control, or reference, sample is an indication that the subject is afflicted with a TEM-1-expressing cancer. In another embodiment the amount of TEM-1 observed in a biological sample obtained from a subject may be compared to levels of TEM-1 known to be associated with certain forms or stages of cancer, to determine the form or stage of the subject's cancer. In some embodiments the amount of TEM-1 in the sample derived from the subject is assessed by contacting the sample with an antibody, or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, that specifically binds TEM-1, such as the antibodies described herein. The sample assessed for the presence of TEM-1 may be derived from urine, blood, serum, plasma, saliva, ascites, circulating cells, circulating tumor cells, cells that are not tissue associated (i.e., free cells), tissues (e.g., surgically resected tumor tissue, biopsies, including fine needle aspiration), histological preparations, and the like. In some embodiments TEM-1-expressing cancer includes melanoma, sarcoma, bladder cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular cancer, or colon cancer. In some embodiments the subject is a human. In some embodiments the method of diagnosing a TEM-1-expressing cancer will involve: contacting a biological sample of a subject with a TEM-1-specific antibody, or an antigen-binding fragment thereof (such as those derivable from the antibodies and fragments provided in Table 2), quantifying the amount of TEM-1 present in the sample that is bound by the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof, comparing the amount of TEM-1 present in the sample to a known standard or reference sample; and determining whether the subject's TEM-1 levels fall within the levels of TEM-1 associated with cancer. In an additional embodiment, the diagnostic method can be followed with an additional step of administering or prescribing a cancer-specific treatment. In another embodiment, the diagnostic method can be followed with an additional step of transmitting the results of the determination to facilitate treatment of the cancer. In some embodiments the cancer-specific treatment may be directed against TEM-1-expressing cancers, such as MORAb-004. In some embodiments the described methods involve assessing whether a subject is afflicted with TEM-1-expressing cancer by determining the amount of TEM-1 present in a blood or serum sample obtained from the subject; and comparing the observed amount of TEM-1 with the amount of TEM-1 in a control, or reference, sample, wherein a difference between the amount of TEM-1 in the sample derived from the subject and the amount of TEM-1 in the control, or reference, sample is an indication that the subject is afflicted with a TEM-1-expressing cancer. In some embodiments the control, or reference, sample may be derived from a subject that is not afflicted with TEM-1-expressing cancer. In some embodiments the control, or reference, sample may be derived from a subject that is afflicted with TEM-1-expressing cancer. In some embodiments where the control, or reference, sample is derived from a subject that is not afflicted with TEM-1-expressing cancer, an observed increase in the amount of TEM-1 present in the test sample, relative to that observed for the control or reference sample, is an indication that the subject being assessed is afflicted with TEM-1-expressing cancer. In some embodiments where the control sample is derived from a subject that is not afflicted with TEM-1-expressing cancer, an observed decrease or similarity in the amount of TEM-1 present in the test sample, relative to that observed for the control or reference sample, is an indication that the subject being assessed is not afflicted with TEM-1-expressing cancer. In some embodiments where the control or reference sample is derived from a subject that is afflicted with TEM-1-expressing cancer, an observed similarity in the amount of TEM-1 present in the test sample, relative to that observed for the control or reference sample, is an indication that the subject being assessed is afflicted with TEM-1-expressing cancer. In some embodiments where the control or reference sample is derived from a subject that is afflicted with TEM-1-expressing cancer, an observed decrease in the amount of TEM-1 present in the test sample, relative to that observed for the control or reference sample, is an indication that the subject being assessed is not afflicted with TEM-1-expressing cancer. In some embodiments the amount of TEM-1 in the sample derived from the subject is assessed by contacting the sample with an antibody, or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, that specifically binds TEM-1, such as the antibodies described herein. The sample assessed for the presence of TEM-1 may be derived from a blood sample, a serum sample, circulating cells, circulating tumor cells, cells that are not tissue associated (i.e., free cells), tissues (e.g., surgically resected tumor tissue, biopsies, including fine needle aspiration), histological preparations, and the like. In various aspects, the amount of TEM-1 is determined by contacting the sample with an antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, that specifically binds TEM-1. In some embodiments, the sample may be contacted by more than one type of antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, that specifically binds TEM-1. In some embodiments, the sample may be contacted by a first antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, that specifically binds TEM-1 and then contacted by a second antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, that specifically binds TEM-1. Antibodies such as those described herein may be used in this capacity. For example, the antibody is selected from the group consisting of: (a) any one of antibody 14G3, antibody 9A5, antibody 7D3, antibody 7H12, antibody 9G5, antibody 10H8, antibody 11D1, antibody 15D10, antibody 15F8, antibody 16D2, or an antigen-binding fragment thereof; (b) an antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, that comprises heavy chain CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 amino acid sequences and light chain CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 amino acid sequences of any one of antibody 14G3, antibody 9A5, antibody 7D3, antibody 7H12, antibody 9G5, antibody 10H8, antibody 11D1, antibody 15D10, antibody 15F8, or antibody 16D2, as described in Table 2; (c) an antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, that comprises the heavy chain variable domain segment and light chain variable domain segment of any one of antibody 14G3, antibody 9A5, antibody 7D3, antibody 7H12, antibody 9G5, antibody 10H8, antibody 11D1, antibody 15D10, antibody 15F8, or antibody 16D2, as described in Table 2; or (d) an antibody having the amino acid sequence of antibody produced by any one of the cell lines deposited with the ATCC having accession PTA-12538, PTA-12545, PTA-12542, PTA-12546, PTA-12541, PTA-12539, PTA-12543, PTA-12540, PTA-12544, or PTA-12547, or an antigen-binding fragment thereof. Various combinations of the antibodies and antigen-binding fragments, as described in Table 4, can be used to provide a “first” and “second” antibody or antigen-binding fragment to carry out the described diagnostic methods. In some embodiments TEM-1-expressing cancer includes melanoma, sarcoma, bladder cancer or colon cancer. In certain embodiments, the amount of TEM-1 is determined by western blot analysis, radioimmunoassay, immunofluorimetry, immunoprecipitation, equilibrium dialysis, immunodiffusion, electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunoassay, immunohistochemistry, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or ELISA assay. In various embodiments of the described diagnostic methods a control or reference sample is used. This sample may be a positive or negative assay control that ensures the assay used is working properly; for example, an assay control of this nature might be commonly used for immunohistochemistry assays. Alternatively, the sample may be a standardized reference for the amount of TEM-1 in a biological sample from a healthy subject. In some embodiments, the observed TEM-1 levels of the tested subject may be compared with TEM-1 levels observed in samples from subjects known to have TEM-1-expressing cancer. In some embodiments, the control subject may be afflicted with a particular cancer of interest. In some embodiments, the control subject is known to have early stage cancer, which may or may not be TEM-1-expressing cancer. In some embodiments, the control subject is known to have intermediate stage cancer, which may or may not be TEM-1-expressing cancer. In some embodiments, the control subject is known to have late stage, which may or may not be TEM-1-expressing cancer. Methods for Monitoring Cancer Provided herein are methods for monitoring TEM-1-expressing cancer in a subject. In some embodiments TEM-1-expressing cancer includes melanoma, sarcoma, bladder cancer or colon cancer. In some embodiments the described methods involve assessing whether TEM-1-expressing cancer is progressing, regressing, or remaining stable by determining the amount of TEM-1 that is present in a test sample derived from the subject; and comparing the observed amount of TEM-1 with the amount of TEM-1 in a biological sample obtained, in a similar manner, from the subject at an earlier point in time, wherein a difference between the amount of TEM-1 in the test sample and the earlier sample provides an indication of whether the cancer is progressing, regressing, or remaining stable. In this regard, a test sample with an increased amount of TEM-1, relative to the amount observed for the earlier sample, may indicate progression of a TEM-1-expressing cancer. Conversely, a test sample with a decreased amount of TEM-1, relative to the amount observed for the earlier sample, may indicate regression of a TEM-1-expressing cancer. Accordingly, a test sample with an insignificant difference in the amount of TEM-1, relative to the amount observed for the earlier sample, may indicate a state of stable disease for a TEM-1-expressing cancer. In some embodiments the amount of TEM-1 in a biological sample derived from the subject is assessed by contacting the sample with an antibody, or an antibody fragment thereof, that specifically binds TEM-1, such as the antibodies described herein. The sample assessed for the presence of TEM-1 may be derived from urine, blood, serum, plasma, saliva, ascites, circulating cells, circulating tumor cells, cells that are not tissue associated (i.e., free cells), tissues (e.g., surgically resected tumor tissue, biopsies, including fine needle aspiration), histological preparations, and the like. In some embodiments the subject is a human. In some embodiments the methods of monitoring a TEM-1-expressing cancer will involve: contacting a biological sample of a subject with a TEM-1-specific antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof (such as those derivable from the antibodies and fragments provided in Table 2), quantifying the amount of TEM-1 present in the sample, comparing the amount of TEM-1 present in the sample to the amount of TEM-1 determined to be in a biological sample obtained, in a similar manner, from the same subject at an earlier point in time; and determining whether the subject's TEM-1 levels have changed over time. A test sample with an increased amount of TEM-1, relative to the amount observed for the earlier sample, may indicate progression of cancer. Conversely, a test sample with a decreased amount of TEM-1, relative to the amount observed for the earlier sample, may indicate regression of a TEM-1-expressing cancer. Accordingly, a test sample with an insignificant difference in the amount of TEM-1, relative to the amount observed for the earlier sample, may indicate a state of stable disease for a TEM-1-expressing cancer. In some embodiments, the TEM-1 levels of the sample may be compared to a known standard or a reference sample, alone or in addition to the TEM-1 levels observed for a sample assessed at an earlier point in time. In an additional embodiment, the diagnostic method can be followed with an additional step of administering a cancer-specific treatment. In some embodiments the cancer-specific treatment may be directed against TEM-1-expressing cancers, such as MORAb-004. In various aspects, the amount of TEM-1 is determined by contacting the sample with an antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, that specifically binds TEM-1. In some embodiments, the sample may be contacted by more than one type of antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, that specifically binds TEM-1. In some embodiments, the sample may be contacted by a first antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, that specifically binds TEM-1 and then contacted by a second antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, that specifically binds TEM-1. Antibodies such as those described herein may be used in this capacity. For example, the antibody may be selected from among: (a) any one of antibody 14G3, antibody 9A5, antibody 7D3, antibody 7H12, antibody 9G5, antibody 10H8, antibody 11D1, antibody 15D10, antibody 15F8, antibody 16D2, or an antigen-binding fragment thereof; (b) an antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, that comprises heavy chain CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 amino acid sequences and light chain CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 amino acid sequences of any one of antibody 14G3, antibody 9A5, antibody 7D3, antibody 7H12, antibody 9G5, antibody 10H8, antibody 11D1, antibody 15D10, antibody 15F8, or antibody 16D2, as described in Table 2; (c) an antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, that comprises the heavy chain variable domain segment and light chain variable domain segment of any one of antibody 14G3, antibody 9A5, antibody 7D3, antibody 7H12, antibody 9G5, antibody 10H8, antibody 11D1, antibody 15D10, antibody 15F8, or antibody 16D2, as described in Table 2; or (d) an antibody having the amino acid sequence of antibody produced by any one of the cell lines deposited with the ATCC having accession number PTA-12538, PTA-12545, PTA-12542, PTA-12546, PTA-12541, PTA-12539, PTA-12543, PTA-12540, PTA-12544, or PTA-12547, or an antigen binding fragment thereof. Various combinations of the antibodies and antigen-binding fragments described in (a)-(d), as detailed in Table 4, can be used to provide a “first” and “second” antibody or antigen-binding fragment to carry out the described monitoring methods. In some embodiments TEM-1-expressing cancer includes melanoma, sarcoma, bladder cancer or colon cancer. In certain embodiments, the amount of TEM-1 is determined by western blot analysis, radioimmunoassay, immunofluorimetry, immunoprecipitation, equilibrium dialysis, immunodiffusion, electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunoassay, immunohistochemistry, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or ELISA assay.

The means for obtaining a sample from a subject may also comprise means for isolating blood components, such as serum, from a blood sample. Preferably, the kit is designed for use with a human subject. The following examples are provided to supplement the prior disclosure and to provide a better understanding of the subject matter described herein. These examples should not be considered to limit the described subject matter. It is understood that the examples and embodiments described herein are for illustrative purposes only and that various modifications or changes in light thereof will be apparent to persons skilled in the art and are to be included within, and can be made without departing from, the true scope of the invention. Example 1 Generation of Monoclonal Antibodies that Selectively Bind TEM-1 To generate antibodies that specifically bind TEM-1, three eight-week old female Lewis rats were immunized with a recombinant version of TEM-1 fused to the Fc portion of a murine γ heavy chain (rTEM-1-Fc) (Tomkowicz, et al., PNAS 104(46):17965-70 (2007)). On day zero rats were immunized intraperitoneally with 100 μg of rTEM-1-Fc prepared as a 1:1 (v:v) mix with complete Freund's adjuvant (Rockland Immunochemicals, Inc., Gilbertsville, Pa.). Immunized rats were boosted with intraperitoneal injections of 50 μg rTEM-1-Fc mixed 1:1 (v:v) with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Rockland Immunochemicals Inc.) on day 14 and every 21 days thereafter. Test bleeds were collected on day 24 and every 21 days thereafter and analyzed by direct enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA) against rTEM-1-His6 (“His6” disclosed as SEQ ID NO: 161). Spleens were harvested from animals exhibiting the highest antigen-specific titers and hybridomas were prepared by electrofusion (Hybrimune™ Model CEEF-50B Waveform Generator; Cellectis, Romainville, France) of splenocytes with Sp2/0 Ag14 myeloma cells (ATCC, Rockville, Md.). Hybridoma supernatants were rescreened by EIA against rTEM-1-His6 (“His6” disclosed as SEQ ID NO: 161) or recombinant mesothelin protein as a negative control, to identify hybridomas producing anti-rTEM-1 antibodies. Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with 100 μL/well of a PBS solution containing 1 μg/mL rTEM-1-His6 (“His6” disclosed as SEQ ID NO: 161) overnight at 4° C. Wells were then washed and blocked with 3% (w/v) fish gel in PBS for 1 hr at RT. Next, 100 μL of a 3-fold dilution series of hybridoma culture supernatant was added to the wells and plates were incubated at RT for 1 hr. After washing 3 times with PBS containing 0.2% (v/v) Tween-20 (PBST), 100 μL of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-rat IgG (1:2500 dilution; Rockland Immunochemicals, Inc.) was added and plates were incubated for 30 min at 37° C. After washing with PBST, 100 μL of substrate (TMBE-100; Rockland Immunochemicals, Inc.) was added and the reaction stopped after 30 minutes by addition of 100 μL of 1M HCl. Plates were read at 450 nm on a Benchmark microplate reader (BioRad, Concord, Calif.). Selected parental cell lines were then subcloned by limiting dilution and re-assayed against rTEM-1 by EIA. Isotyping of selected clones was performed using the Clonetyping System (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, Ala.). Selected hybridoma cell lines (Table 5) were tested for mycoplasma using the mycoplasma PCR ELISA (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) Monoclonal antibodies (mABs) were produced from mycoplasma negative cells grown in 1 L roller bottle cultures. After seeding at 0.5×105 cells/mL, cultures were grown for 21 days in serum free medium (Invitrogen) and 5% low IgG fetal bovine serum (Gibco). At termination, culture supernatants were concentrated approximately 10-fold through a 50 kDa filtration membrane (SpectrumLabs, Rancho Dominguez, Calif.) and mAbs were purified by affinity chromatography, eluted and subsequently dialyzed against PBS using a 12-14 kDa membranous tubing (SpectrumLabs, Rancho Dominguez Calif.), sterile filtered using 0.22 μm Express™PLUS Stericups (Millipore, Billerica Mass.), aliquotted and stored at −80° C.

Initially, Western blot analyses were performed using reduced and denatured cell lysates from either aortic smooth muscle cells (“5”) (Invitrogen), which are known to express TEM-1, or human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (“H”) (ScienCell), which do not express TEM-1. Briefly, aortic smooth muscle cells and HUVECs were lysed in 1.1% OBG buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, ph 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1.1% OBG) supplemented with Complete™ Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Diagnostics)+PMSF (100 nM) for 15 minutes on ice, then centrifuged at 13,000×g for 15 minutes to remove cellular debris. Equal amounts of total protein (30 μg) were added to NuPAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen) containing 5% B-mercaptoethanol+20 mM DTT. Proteins were separated using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) on a 4-12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to PVDF membrane Immunoblotting was conducted using the described rat TEM-1-specific antibodies overnight at 4 degrees Celsius, which were then detected with a goat anti-rat-HRP conjugated antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch) and visualized using SuperSignal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Signal was visualized using the Omega 12iC molecular imaging system (Ultra-Lum). As shown in FIG. 1, the majority of the tested antibodies were able to detect reduced and denatured TEM-1, indicating that these antibodies recognize an epitope of the protein that is not conformation-dependent. FACS analyses were also performed using aortic smooth muscle cells (AoSMC) and HUVEC cells. Cells were harvested using cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen, #13151-014), washed twice in PBS and re-suspended at 50,000 cells/100 μL FACS buffer (PBS+2% FBS) in a round bottom 96 well plate. Cells were incubated for 1 hour on ice with the described rat TEM-1-specific antibodies at a concentration of 10 μg/mL, washed and then incubated with FITC-conjugated goat-anti-rat secondary antibodies (dilution 1:100) (Southern Biotech). Prior to analysis, cells were labeled with 7-AAD (BD Biosciences) to allow for the exclusion of nonviable cells. Cells were analyzed on an EasyCyte Flow Cytometer (Guava Technologies). The data in Table 6 indicate that all of the tested antibodies bind TEM-1 in a native state.

For these studies streptavidin-coated sensor surfaces were generated by injecting CAP reagent for 5 minutes at a flow rate of 2 μl/min. Biotinylated TEM1-Fc (10 μg/ml) was injected onto the streptavidin coated sensor surface for 20 sec (Fc2, RL=˜50 RU), 40 sec (Fc3, RL=˜100 RU), and 60 sec (Fc4, RL=˜150 RU) at a flow rate of 25 μl/minute. Rat anti-TEM-1 MAbs were injected for 300 seconds at 0.5 nM, 2 nM, 5 nM, 20 nM, and 50 nM concentrations and the dissociations were monitored for 30 minutes at a flow rate of 25 μl/minute. The sensor surface was regenerated by injecting a CAP kit regeneration solution for 120 sec at a flow rate of 25 μl/minute. The sensorgrams were analyzed using 1:1 binding model.

An indirect immunohistochemical (IHC) testing method was performed for these experiments using Avidin-Biotin Complex (ABC) detection (Vector Labs; catalog # PK-6100). Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens were sectioned at 5 microns on positively-charged glass slides and heated for approximately 60 minutes at 60° C. Slides were deparaffinized in 3 sequential baths of xylene for 3 minutes each, transferred to three sequential baths of 100% alcohol for 3 minutes each, followed by three sequential baths of 95% alcohol for 3 minutes each and then rinsed for 5 minutes in deionized (DI) water. For the IHC procedure, slides were pretreated in Diva heat-induced epitope retrieval solution (Biocare Medical; catalog # DV 2004 MX) diluted to 1:10 in DI water, placed inside a pressurized decloaking chamber already filled with 500 ml of DI water, and incubated for 30 seconds at 125° C. and 15-20 PSI and then gradually cooled for 15 minutes down to 95° C. Then the slides were cooled at room temperature for 15 minutes before being gently rinsed in DI water until detergent bubbles disappeared. The slides were then washed in 3 sequential baths of Tris Buffered Saline/0.1% Tween-20 wash buffer (TBST) for 3 minutes each (all subsequent buffer washes were performed in this manner). The washed slides were placed into Peroxidase-1 blocking solution (Biocare Medical; catalog # PX 968 MM; reagent is ready to use) for 5 minutes at room temperature and then washed again with TBST. The slides were then incubated for 30 minutes in 5% goat serum and then, without washing, were incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature in a solution containing either 1.25 μg/ml (1:1200) of primary anti-TEM-1 clone 9G5 antibody diluted in Antibody Diluent (Dako; catalog # S0809) or Murine IgG1κ Negative Isotype reagent (Sigma Aldrich; catalog # M9269-1MG). After incubation the slides were washed with TBST and then incubated with biotinylated anti-rat secondary link antibody (Vector Labs; catalog # BA-9400) at 7.5 μg/ml for 30 minutes at room temperature. The slides were again washed with TBST prior to being incubated with the ABC detection reagent (Vector Labs) diluted 1:50 in TBST for 30 minutes at room temperature. After washing with TBST, the slides were incubated in 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) substrate buffer and chromogen solution (Dako; catalog # K3468) for 5 minutes at room temperature. Following incubation, slides were thoroughly rinse slides in DI water 3 times for 30-60 seconds each prior to counterstaining the slides with hematoxylin (Harris) for 2 minutes. The slides were then dehydrated in 3 sequential baths each of 95% and 100% alcohol for 30 seconds each. The slides were cleared in 3 sequential baths of xylene for 30 seconds each before applying coverslips. Selected images are provided in FIG. 2. Additional sections that stained positive for TEM-1 expression include hepatocellular cancer metastases to the duodenal bulb, hepatocellular cancer metastases to the scalp, hepatocellular cancer metastases to the lung, hepatocellular cancer metastases to the clavicle, hepatocellular cancer metastaises to the pleura, colorectal cancer metastaises to the liver, colorectal cancer metastases to the lung, colorectal cancer metastases to the bladder, colorectal cancer metastases to lymph node, colorectal cancer metastases to the abdomen, gastric cancer metasaises to the peritoneum, gastric cancer metasases to the cerebellum, gastric cancer metasases to the omentum, gastric cancer metasases to the liver, gastric cancer metasases to a lymph node, and gastric cancer metasases to the lung (data not shown). Example 3 Detection of TEM-1 in Normal Human Serum Blood samples obtained from normal human subjects or melanoma patients were assessed to determine if TEM-1 could be detected in human blood. For this study, serum from normal healthy donors was pre-cleared with protein G sepharose FF beads (Amersham), followed by centrifugation to remove the sepharose beads. TEM-1 was immunoprecipitated by adding MORAb-004 (2 μg) and incubating the cleared serum samples overnight, adding washed protein G sepharose beads to the serum/antibody mixture, and rocking the mixture for an additional two hours. After incubation, the samples were centrifuged and the supernatant was removed. The samples were then washed three times with cold lysis buffer 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1.1% OBG supplemented with Complete™ Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Diagnostics)+PMSF (100 nM)). Protein was eluted using in 4× NuPAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen) containing 5% (3-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 10 minutes. Proteins were separated using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) on a 4-12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to PVDF membrane Immunoblotting was conducted using a rabbit anti-TEM-1 antibody, detected with a goat anti-rabbit-HRP conjugated antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch) and visualized using SuperSignal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Signal was visualized using the Omega 12iC molecular imaging system (Ultra-Lum). FIG. 3 illustrates that TEM-1 can be readily detected in samples derived from human blood of both normal subjects and melanoma patients. Example 4 Electrochemiluminescence Assay for the Detection of TEM-1 An electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay was developed for the detection of TEM-1 in the presence of TEM-1-specific antibody MORAb-004. The assay makes use of biotin labeled (20:1) anti-TEM-1 antibody 9G5 as the capture antibody and sulfo-TAG labeled (20:1) anti-TEM-1 antibody 15F8 for detection. Samples and controls diluted 1:10 in assay buffer (1% casein in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100) were quantified using 7 standard calibrators prepared with a 250 ng/mL recombinant CHO TEM-1 Fc fusion protein (Morphotek, Inc.) titrated 5-fold to 16 pg/mL in assay buffer. The assay was carried out by adding 100 μL of complex mix containing 0.5 μg/mL biotin labeled anti-TEM-1 antibody and 0.5 μg/mL sulfo-TAG anti-TEM-1 antibody in 1% casein in PBS to 500 μL of each standard, control, and sample, prepared in the presence or absence of MORAb-004, on a polypropylene microplate, and incubating the mixture at ambient temperature for 1 hour with agitation. During complex formation, a Mesoscale Discovery (Gaithersburg, Md.) standard streptavidin plate was blocked with 150 μL/well of 1% casein in PBS for 1 hour at ambient temperature with shaking. After removal of blocking buffer, 50 μL of complex samples were incubated in duplicate wells on the streptavidin plate for 1 hour at ambient temperature with shaking. The plates were washed three times with 1×PBS with 0.1% Tween 20, and 150 μL/well 1× read buffer T was added and then read with MSD Sector Imager 2400. Table 8 shows the ability of the ECL assay to detect TEM-1 in the presence or absence of MORAb-004.

The assay was carried out as described above; however, instead of assessing the ability of the detecting antibodies to perform adequately in the presence of MORAb-004, 50 ng of TEM-1-Fc was added into either diluted pooled serum or diluted pooled plasma and the degree of recovery was determined (Tables 9 and 10). For each condition tested approximately 90% or more of added TEM-1 was accounted for by the ECL method. The detection range for the assay is provided in FIG. 4.

Blood samples were obtained from normal subjects or subjects known to have cancer and the concentration of TEM-1 in plasma or serum was determined, as described in Example 4. As shown in FIG. 5, serum TEM-1 concentrations were elevated in patients having disease-stage melanoma when compared to levels observed for subjects not known to have cancer. In a broader study, the concentrations of TEM-1 in plasma samples from 50 normal individuals, 95 colon cancer patients, 36 melanoma patients, and 34 sarcoma patients were determined to assess whether elevated TEM-1 concentration correlated to disease. A statistical analysis (pair-wise t-test) demonstrates that cancer patient plasma TEM-1 levels are statistically significantly different from plasma levels of TEM-1 in normal individuals (Table 11 and FIG. 6).
