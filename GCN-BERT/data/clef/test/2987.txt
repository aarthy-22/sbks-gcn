TITLE OF THE INVENTION FACTOR IXA INHIBITORS FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to novel compounds of the Formula (I) having antithrombotic activity which, in particular, inhibit blood clotting factor IXa, to processes for their preparation and to use thereof as medicaments. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Factor IXa is a plasma serine protease involved in the regulation of blood coagulation. While blood coagulation is a necessary and important part of the regulation of an organism's homeostasis, abnormal blood coagulation can also have deleterious effects. For instance, thrombosis is the formation or presence of a blood clot inside a blood vessel or cavity of the heart. Such a blood clot can lodge in a blood vessel blocking circulation and inducing a heart attack or stroke. Thromboembolic disorders are the largest cause of mortality and disability in the industrialized world. Blood clotting is a process of control of the blood stream essential for the survival of mammals. The process of clotting, and the subsequent dissolution of the clot after wound healing has taken place, commences after vascular damage, and can be divided into four phases. The first phase, vasoconstriction or vasocontraction, can cause a decrease in blood loss in the damaged area. In the next phase, platelet activation by thrombin, platelets attach to the site of the vessel wall damage and form a platelet aggregate. In the third phase, formation of clotting complexes leads to massive formation of thrombin, which converts soluble fibrinogen to fibrin by cleavage of two small peptides. In the fourth phase, after wound healing, the thrombus is dissolved by the action of the key enzyme of the endogenous fibrinolysis system, plasmin. Two alternative pathways can lead to the formation of a fibrin clot, the intrinsic and the extrinsic pathway. These pathways are initiated by different mechanisms, but in the later phase they converge to give a common final path of the clotting cascade. In this final path of clotting, clotting factor X is activated. The activated factor X is responsible for the formation of thrombin from the inactive precursor prothrombin circulating in the blood. The formation of a thrombus on the bottom of a vessel wall abnormality without a wound is the result of the intrinsic pathway. Fibrin clot formation as a response to tissue damage or an injury is the result of the extrinsic pathway. Both pathways comprise a relatively large number of proteins, which are known as clotting factors. The intrinsic pathway requires the clotting factors V, VIII, IX, X, XI and XII and also prekallikrein, high molecular weight kininogen, calcium ions and phospholipids from platelets. The intrinsic pathway is initiated when prekallikrein, high molecular weight kininogen factor XI and XII bind to a negatively charged surface. This point in time is designated as the contact phase. Exposure to vessel wall collagen is the primary stimulus of the contact phase. The result of the processes of the contact phase is the conversion of prekallikrein to kallikrein, which in turn activates factor XII. Factor Xlla hydro lyzes further prekallikrein to kallikrein, such that activation is the result. With increasing activation of factor XII, activation of factor XI occurs, which leads to a release of bradykinin, a vasodilator. As a result, the ending of the initial phase of vasoconstriction occurs. Bradykinin is formed from high molecular weight kininogen. In the presence of Ca2+ ions, factor XIa activates factor IX. Factor IX is a proenzyme, which contains vitamin K-dependent, γ-carboxyglutamic acid (GLA) residues. The serine protease activity becomes noticeable after binding of Ca2+ to these GLA residues. A number of the serine proteases of the blood clotting cascade (factors II, VII, IX and X) contain such vitamin K-dependent GLA residues. Factor IXa cleaves factor X and leads to activation to factor Xa. The prerequisite for the formation of factor IXa is the formation of a tenase complex from Ca2+ and the factors Villa, IXa and X on the surface of activated platelets. One of the reactions of activated platelets is the presentation of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol along the surfaces. The exposure of these phospholipids first makes the formation of the tenase complex possible. Factor VIII in this process has the function of a receptor for the factors IXa and X. Factor VIII is therefore a cofactor in the clotting cascade. The activation of factor VIII with formation of factor Villa, the actual receptor, needs only a minimal amount of thrombin. With increase in the concentration of thrombin, factor Villa is finally cleaved further and inactivated by thrombin. This dual activity of thrombin in relation to factor VIII leads to a self-restriction of tenase complex formation and thus to a limitation of blood clotting. The extrinsic pathway requires a tissue factor (TF) and clotting factors V, VII, VIII, IX and X. In the case of a vessel injury, the tissue factor (TF) accumulates with the clotting factor VII and the latter is activated. The complex of TF and clotting factor VII has two substrates, clotting factors X and IX. Clotting factor IX can be activated by means of the intrinsic pathway and the extrinsic pathway. The activation of factor IXa is thus a central point of intersection between the two pathways of activation of clotting. Factor IXa has an important role in blood clotting. Defects in factor IXa lead to hemophilia B, while increased concentrations of factor IXa in the blood lead to a significantly increased risk of thrombosis formation (Weltermann A, et al., J Thromb Haemost. 2003; 1 : 28-32). The regulation of factor IXa activity can reduce thrombus formation in animal models (Feuerstein GZ, et al, Thromb Haemost. 1999; 82: 1443-1445). Vijaykumar et al, Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters (2006), 16 (10), 2796-2799, discloses hydroxy pyrazole based factor IXa inhibitors. Recently, compounds that antagonize Factor IXa antagonism have been disclosed in, for example, PCT Publication No. WO 2008/031508, PCT Publication No. WO 2008/031509, PCT Publication No. WO 2007/070826, PCT Publication No. WO 2008/076805, PCT Publication No. WO 2009/143039, PCT Publication No. WO 2010/065717, PCT Publication No. WO 2011/017296, PCT Publication No. WO 2011/025565, PCT Publication No. WO 20013/009527. However, these publications do not disclose the Benzamide derivatives of the instant invention. In the development of pharmaceuticals, strict criteria are required for not only target pharmacological activity but also absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and the like. It is also necessary to study drug interactions, desensitization or tolerance, digestive absorption in oral administration, the rate of transfer to the small intestine, the rate of absorption and first-pass effect, an organ barrier, protein binding, induction of a drug-metabolizing enzyme, an excretion pathway and body clearance, a method of administration (an application site, a method, and purpose), and the like. It is very difficult to discover a drug that satisfies all of these requirements. These comprehensive problems in drug development might also exist for Factor IXa antagonists, and Factor IXa antagonists have not yet been approved. More specifically, known compounds having a Factor IXa antagonism may also include problems in terms of usefulness and safety. For example, these compounds may have low absorption, and oral administration of these compounds may be difficult; these compounds also may exhibit inhibitory activity of the human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) channel, which may cause arrhythmia, and pharmacokinetics of these compounds might not satisfactory. Accordingly, a safe and effective Factor IXa antagonist is desired.

Except where noted, structures containing substituent variables such as variable "R" below: which are depicted as not being attached to any one particular bicycle carbon atom, represent structures in which the variable can be optionally attached to any bicycle carbon atom. For example, variable R shown in the above structure can be attached to any one of 6 bicycle carbon atoms i, ii, iii, iv or v. Functional groups of the intermediates used, for example amino or carboxyl groups, can be masked here by suitable protective groups. Suitable protective groups for amino functions are, for example, para methoxy benzyl, benzyl, t-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, phthalolyl, trityl or tosyl protective group. Suitable protective groups for the carboxyl function are, for example, alkyl, aryl or arylalkyl esters. Protective groups can be introduced and removed by techniques which are well-known or described here (see Greene, T.W., et. al, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (2007), 4th Ed., Wiley, New York, or Kocienski, R, Protecting Groups (1994), Thieme). The term protective group can also include polymer-bound protective groups. Such masked compounds according to Formula (I), in which, for example, the functional groups of the radicals R1, R2, R3 or R4 can optionally also be masked, can, although optionally themselves not pharmacologically active, optionally be converted after administration to mammals by metabolization to the pharmacologically active compounds according to the invention. When any variable (e.g., aryl, R1, etc.) occurs more than one time in any constituent or in Formula (I), its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. As used herein, the term "composition" is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts. In the embodiments described below of the present invention, unless otherwise noted, the definitions of n, p, q, r, X, Y, R1, R2, R3, R4, a substructure of ring A represented by Formula (III), Het and a substructure of ring B represented by Formula (V) shown in the each descriptions are the same as defined above for the Formula (I). In the embodiments, compounds having Factor IXa antagonistic activity (determined by, for example, pharmacological examples described below: a measurement of fluorescence value using microtiter plate reader, ARVO 1420 Multilabel Counter) of 5 μΜ or less, preferably 1 μΜ or less, more preferably 500 nM or less, and the most preferably 100 nM or less in terms of an IC50 value are preferably used. In the embodiments described in this description, "agent" or "drug" means a material which is used for improvement of disease or symptom, not only for treatment of disease or symptom. In all the above embodiments, when the term "compound" is used, the term also refers to pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The compounds of the present invention have asymmetric carbon atoms. Accordingly, the compounds of the present invention include mixtures of various stereoisomers, such as geometrical isomers, tautomers, such as keto- and enol- tautomers, or amidino- and imidino- tautomers, optical isomers, diastereo isomers and isolated isomers. For example, the compounds of Formula (I), Formula (I-a) and Formula (VII) may have (IS, 4S, IR), and (IR, 4R, 7S) optical isomers at a substructure of ring A represented by Formula (Ill-a) and (IS, 2R, 4R), and (IR, 2S, 4R) optical isomers at a substructure of ring A represented by Formula (Ill-b). (lll-b) ( lll-b-1 ) b-2) In final compounds or intermediate compounds, each optical isomers can be obtained from the corresponding diastereomer by using a method of separation, for example, High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with chiral columns, or by using asymmetric synthesis with appropriate starting materials. In EXAMPLES of this specification, in the case of the racemate of diastereomers having a substructure of ring A represented by Formula (Ill-a) in final compounds or intermediate compounds are separated into two optical isomers by using a method of separation of High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with chiral columns, each optical isomers are set forth as the optical isomer (IS*, 4S*, 7R*) of earlier-eluate or the other optical isomer (IS*, 4S*, 7R*) of later-eluate. Specific examples under the rule mentioned above are, for example, N-((l S*,4S!i:,7R!i:)-2-(3-Amino-4-chloroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-7-yl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan- 7-yl)-2-chloro-4-(3-methyl-lH-l,2,4-triazol-l-yl)benzamide (the earlier-eluate) (EXAMPLE 7.1) and N-((lS*,4S!i:,7R!i:)-2-(3-Arnino-4-chloroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-7-yl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan- 7-yl)-2-chloro-4-(3-methyl-lH-l,2,4-triazol-l-yl)benzamide (the later-eluate) (EXAMPLE 7.2). The isolation and the purification of such stereoisomers can be performed by one of ordinary skill in the art with a known technique such as optical resolution using preferential crystallization or column chromatography, or asymmetric synthesis. Absolute stereochemistry may be determined by X-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing a stereogenic center of known configuration. The compounds of the present invention may be administered in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases or acids including inorganic or organic bases and inorganic or organic acids. The compounds represented by Formula (I) of the present invention may form acid addition salts. Alternatively, these compounds may form salts with a base according to the type of substituent. These salts are not particularly limited as long as the salts are pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Specific examples of the salts include acid addition salts with a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, or phosphoric acid; an organic carboxylic acid such as an aliphatic monocarboxylic acid, e.g., formic acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), propionic acid, butyric acid, valeric acid, enanthic acid, capric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, lactic acid, sorbic acid, or mandelic acid, an aromatic monocarboxylic acid, e.g., benzoic acid or salicylic acid, an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid, e.g., oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, malic acid, or tartaric acid, and an aliphatic tricarboxylic acid e.g., citric acid; an organic sulfonic acid such as an aliphatic sulfonic acid, e.g., methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, trifluoromethanesulfomc acid, or 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, or an aromatic sulfonic acid, e.g., benzenesulfonic acid or /?-toluenesulfonic acid; or an acidic amino acid, e.g., aspartic acid or glutamic acid; salts with a metal such as an alkali metal, e.g., sodium or potassium, or an alkaline earth metal, e.g., magnesium or calcium; salts with an organic base such as methylamine, ethylamine, ethanolamine, pyridine, lysine, arginine, or ornithine; and ammonium salts. These salts can be obtained by a known method, for example, by mixing a compound of the present invention with an equivalent amount and a solution containing a desired acid, base, or the like, and then collecting the desired salt by filtering the salt or distilling off the solvent. The compounds of the present invention and salts thereof can form solvates with a solvent such as water, ethanol, or glycerol. The salts of a compound of the present invention include monosalts and di-salts. The compounds of the present invention can form an acid addition salt and a salt with a base at the same time according to the type of substituent of the side chain. Furthermore, the present invention includes hydrates, pharmaceutically acceptable various solvates, and crystal polymorphism of the compounds represented by Formula (I) of the present invention. The present invention is not limited to the compounds described in examples below and includes all compounds represented by Formula (I) of the present invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Prodrugs and solvates of the compounds of the invention are also contemplated herein. A discussion of prodrugs is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, 14, 1987, of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, 1987, Edward B. Roche, ed., American Pharmaceutical Assosiation and Pergamon Press. The term "prodrug" means a compound (e.g, a drug precursor) that is transformed in vivo to yield a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or a solvate of the compound. The transformation may occur by various mechanisms (e.g., by metabolic or chemical processes), such as, for example, through hydrolysis in blood. A discussion of the use of prodrugs is provided by T. Higuchi and W. Stella, "Pro-drugs as Nobel Delivery Systems," Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Associatiion and Pergamon Press, 1987. For example, if a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or a solvate of the compound contains an alcohol functional group, a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group such as, for example, (C2-7 alkanoyl)oxymethyl, l-((C2-7 alkanoyl)oxy)ethyl, 1 -methyl- l-((C2-7 alkanoyl)oxy)ethyl, (C1-6 alkoxy)carbonyloxymethyl, N-(C1-6 alkoxy)carbonylaminomethyl, succinoyl, C2-7 alkanoyl, a-aminoCi_4 alkanyl, arylacyl and a-aminoacyl, or α-aminoacyl-a-aminoacyl, where each a-aminoacyl group is independently selected from the naturally occurring L-amino acids, -P(0)(OH)2, -P(0)(OC1-6 alkyl)2 or glycosyl (the radical resulting from the removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal from of a carbohydrate), and the like. For example, if a compound of Formula (I) incorporates an amine functional group or imine functional group, for example, such as a part of amidino group, a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of a hydrogen atom of the amine group or imine group with a group such as, for example, hydroxyl group, RO-, R-carbonyl, RO-carbonyl, NRR'-carbonyl where R and R are each independently hydrogen atom, Ci_6 alkyl, C3-12 cycloalkyl, C6-14 aryl, C7-20 alalkyl, or R-carbonyl is a natural α-aminoacyl or natural β-aminoacyl, -CH(OY2)Y3 wherein Y2 is Ci_6 alkyl and Y3 is Ci_6 alkyl, C2-7 alkanoyl, amino Ci_6 alkyl or N- Ci_6 alkyl amino, N,N-di Ci_6 alkylamino, -CH(Y4)Y5 wherein Y4 is H or methyl and Y5 is N- Ci_6 alkyl amino, N,N-di Ci_6 alkylamino,morpholino-l-yl, piperidin-l-yl or pyrrolidin-l-yl and the like. For example, esters can optionally be made by esterification of an available carboxylic acid group or by formation of an ester on an available hydroxy group in a compound. Similarly, labile amides can be made. Pharmaceutically acceptable esters or amides of the compounds of this invention may be prepared to act as pro-drugs which can be hydrolyzed back to an acid (or -COO- depending on the pH of the fluid or tissue where conversion takes place) or hydroxy form particularly in vivo and as such are encompassed within the scope of this invention. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable pro-drug modifications include, but are not limited to, -C1-6 alkyl esters and -C1-6 alkyl substituted with phenyl esters. Also, in the case of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) or alcohol group being present in the compounds of the present invention, pharmaceutically acceptable esters of carboxylic acid derivatives, such as methyl, ethyl, or pivaloyloxymethyl, or acyl derivatives of alcohols, such as O-acetyl, O-pivaloyl, O-benzoyl, and O-aminoacyl, can be employed. Included are those esters and acyl groups known in the art for modifying the solubility or hydrolysis characteristics for use as sustained-release or prodrug formulations. If the compounds of Formula I simultaneously contain acidic and basic groups in the molecule, the invention also includes, in addition to the salt forms mentioned, inner salts or betaines (zwitterions). Salts can be obtained from the compounds of Formula I by customary methods which are known to the person skilled in the art, for example by combination with an organic or inorganic acid or base in a solvent or dispersant, or by anion exchange or cation exchange from other salts. The present invention also includes all salts of the compounds of Formula I which, owing to low physiological compatibility, are not directly suitable for use in pharmaceuticals but which can be used, for example, as intermediates for chemical reactions or for the preparation of physiologically acceptable salts. In the compounds of the invention, the atoms may exhibit their natural isotopic abundances, or one or more of the atoms may be artificially enriched in a particular isotope having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number predominantly found in nature. The present invention is meant to include all suitable isotopic variations of the specifically and generically described compounds. For example, different isotopic forms of hydrogen (H) include protium (1H) and deuterium (2H). Protium is the predominant hydrogen isotope found in nature. Enriching for deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages, such as increasing in vivo half-life or reducing dosage requirements, or may provide a compound useful as a standard for characterization of biological samples. Isotopically-enriched compounds can be prepared without undue experimentation by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the general process schemes and examples herein using appropriate isotopically-enriched reagents and/or intermediates.

Deprotection methods of such protective groups are different depending on the chemical properties of a protected reactive group (a hydroxy group, a thiol group, or an imino group) and an employed protective group. For example, an acyl-type protective group such as an alkanoyl group, an alkoxycarbonyl group, and an aroyl group can be hydrolyzed using a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide including lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, and potassium hydroxide for the deprotection.

An arylmethoxycarbonyl group such as a benzyloxycarbonyl group, a para-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl group, and a para-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl group and an arylmethyl group such as a benzyl group can be removed by hydrogenolysis using a palladium carbon catalyst. A benzyl group can be removed by Birch reduction using metallic sodium in liquid ammonia. A triphenylmethyl group can be removed using a suitable acid such as acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, trifluoroacetic acid, and trifluoromethanesulfomc acid or a combination of them.

During the production of the compound of Formula (I) of the present invention, when it has a reactive group such as a hydroxy group, an amino group, and a carboxy group, such group may be properly protected in any reaction step, and the protective group may be removed in a suitable step. Methods for introducing and removing such protective groups are properly employed depending on the type of a group to be protected or a protective group. For example, such introduction and removal can be performed by methods described in the review section of Greene, T.W., et. al, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2007, 4th Ed., Wiley, New York, or Kocienski, P., Protecting Groups 1994, Thieme.

The required starting materials for the asymmetric synthesis of the optical isomers of compound (A-6), (A-6-2) and (A-6-3) are either commercially available, or known, or capable of being readily synthesized by the method commonly used in the organic chemistry from commercially available products. Acidic or basic products of the compound of the Formula (I) can be present in the form of their salts or in free form. Pharmacologically acceptable salts are preferred, for example alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts such as hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, sulfates, hemisulfates, all possible phosphates, and salts of the amino acids, natural bases or carboxylic acids. The preparation of pharmacologically acceptable salts from compounds of the Formula (I) capable of salt formation, including their stereoisomeric forms is carried out in a manner known per se. With basic reagents such as hydroxides, carbonates, hydrogencarbonates, alkoxides and ammonia or organic bases, for example, trimethyl- or triethylamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine or triethanolamine, trometamol or alternatively basic amino acids, for example lysine, ornithine or arginine, the compounds of the Formula (I) form stable alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or optionally substituted ammonium salts. If the compounds of the Formula (I) have basic groups, stable acid addition salts can also be prepared using strong acids. For this, inorganic and organic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, hemisulfuric, phosphoric, methanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic, 4-bromobenzenesulfonic, cyclohexylamidosulfonic, trifluoromethylsulfonic, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic, acetic, oxalic, tartaric, succinic, glycerolphosphoric, lactic, malic, adipic, citric, fumaric, maleic, gluconic, glucuronic, palmitic or trifluoroacetic acid are suitable.

MS (ESI) m/z = 500, 502 (M+H) UTILITY The invention also relates to medicaments which contain an efficacious amount of at least one compound of the Formula (I) and/or of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the compound of the Formula (I) and/or an optionally stereoisomeric form of the compound of the Formula (I), together with a pharmaceutically suitable and pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, additive and/or other active substances and auxiliaries. On account of their pharmacological properties, the compounds according to the invention are suitable, for example, for the prophylaxis, secondary prevention and therapy of all those diseases which are treatable by inhibition of blood clotting factor IXa. Thus, the compounds according to the invention are suitable as inhibitors both for prophylactic and for therapeutic administration to humans. They are suitable both for acute treatment and for long-term therapy. The compounds of the Formula (I) can be employed in patients who are suffering from disorders of well-being or diseases which accompany thromboses, embolisms, hypercoagulability or fibrotic changes. These include myocardial infarct, angina pectoris and all other forms of acute coronary syndrome, stroke, peripheral vascular diseases, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, embolic or thrombotic events caused by cardiac arrhythmias, cardiovascular events such as restenosis after revascularization, angioplasty and similar interventions such as stent implantations and bypass operations. Furthermore, the compounds of the Formula (I) can be employed in all interventions which lead to contact of the blood with foreign surfaces, as in dialysis patients and patients with indwelling catheters. Compounds of the Formula (I) can also be employed in order to reduce the risk of thrombosis after surgical interventions such as in knee and hip joint operations. Compounds of the Formula (I) are suitable for the treatment of patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation, sepsis and other intravascular events which accompany inflammation. Furthermore, compounds of the Formula (I) are suitable for the prophylaxis and treatment of patients with atherosclerosis, diabetes and the metabolic syndrome and their sequelae. Disorders of the hemostatic system (for example fibrin deposits) have been implicated in mechanisms which lead to tumor growth and tumor metastasis, and in the inflammatory and degenerative joint diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and arthrosis. Compounds of the Formula (I) are suitable for the retardation or prevention of such processes. Further indications for the use of the compounds of the Formula (I) are fibrotic changes of the lungs such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and of the eye, such as fibrin deposits after eye operations. Compounds of the Formula (I) are also suitable for the prevention and/or treatment of scar formation. Anticoagulant therapy is indicated for the treatment and prevention of a variety of thrombotic conditions, particularly coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease. Those experienced in this field are readily aware of the circumstances requiring anticoagulant therapy. The term "patient" used herein is taken to mean mammals such as primates (including humans), sheep, horses, cattle, pigs, dogs, cats, rats, and mice. Factor IXa inhibition is useful not only in the anticoagulant therapy of individuals having thrombotic conditions, but is useful whenever inhibition of blood coagulation is required such as to prevent coagulation of stored whole blood and to prevent coagulation in other biological samples for testing or storage. Thus, the Factor IXa inhibitors can be added to or contacted with any medium containing or suspected of containing thrombin and in which it is desired that blood coagulation be inhibited, e.g., when contacting the mammal's blood with material selected from the group consisting of vascular grafts, stents, orthopedic prosthesis, cardiac prosthesis, and extracorporeal circulation systems. Compounds of the invention may be useful for treating or preventing venous thromboembolism (e.g., obstruction or occlusion of a vein by a detached thrombus; obstruction or occlusion of a lung artery by a detached thrombus), cardiogenic thromboembolism (e.g., obstruction or occlusion of the heart by a detached thrombus), arterial thrombosis (e.g., formation of a thrombus within an artery that may cause infarction of tissue supplied by the artery), atherosclerosis (e.g., arteriosclerosis characterized by irregularly distributed lipid deposits) in mammals, and for lowering the propensity of devices that come into contact with blood to clot blood. Examples of venous thromboembolism which may be treated or prevented with compounds of the invention include obstruction of a vein, obstruction of a lung artery (pulmonary embolism), deep vein thrombosis, thrombosis associated with cancer and cancer chemotherapy, thrombosis inherited with thrombophilic diseases such as Protein C deficiency, Protein S deficiency, antithrombin III deficiency, and Factor V Leiden, and thrombosis resulting from acquired thrombophilic disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (inflammatory connective tissue disease). Also with regard to venous thromboembolism, compounds of the invention may be useful for maintaining patency of indwelling catheters. Examples of cardiogenic thromboembolism which may be treated or prevented with compounds of the invention include thromboembolic stroke (detached thrombus causing neurological affliction related to impaired cerebral blood supply), cardiogenic thromboembolism associated with atrial fibrillation (rapid, irregular twitching of upper heart chamber muscular fibrils), cardiogenic thromboembolism associated with prosthetic heart valves such as mechanical heart valves, and cardiogenic thromboembolism associated with heart disease. Examples of arterial thrombosis include unstable angina (severe constrictive pain in chest of coronary origin), myocardial infarction (heart muscle cell death resulting from insufficient blood supply), ischemic heart disease (local anemia due to obstruction (such as by arterial narrowing) of blood supply), reocclusion during or after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, occlusion of coronary artery bypass grafts, and occlusive cerebrovascular disease. Also with regard to arterial thrombosis, compounds of the invention may be useful for maintaining patency in arteriovenous cannulas. Examples of atherosclerosis include arteriosclerosis. Examples of devices that come into contact with blood include vascular grafts, stents, orthopedic prosthesis, cardiac prosthesis, and extracorporeal circulation systems The medicaments according to the invention can be administered by oral, inhalative, rectal or transdermal administration or by subcutaneous, intraarticular, intraperitoneal or intravenous injection. Oral administration is preferred. Coating of stents with compounds of the Formula (I) and other surfaces which come into contact with blood in the body is possible. The invention also relates to a process for the production of a medicament, which comprises bringing at least one compound of the Formula (I) into a suitable administration form using a pharmaceutically suitable and pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally further suitable active substances, additives or auxiliaries. Suitable solid or galenical preparation forms are, for example, granules, powders, coated tablets, tablets, (micro)capsules, suppositories, syrups, juices, suspensions, emulsions, drops or injectable solutions and preparations having prolonged release of active substance, in whose preparation customary excipients such as vehicles, disintegrants, binders, coating agents, swelling agents, glidants or lubricants, flavorings, sweeteners and solubilizers are used. Frequently used auxiliaries which may be mentioned are magnesium carbonate, titanium dioxide, lactose, mannitol and other sugars, talc, lactose, gelatin, starch, cellulose and its derivatives, animal and plant oils such as cod liver oil, sunflower, peanut or sesame oil, polyethylene glycol and solvents such as, for example, sterile water and mono- or polyhydric alcohols such as glycerol. The dosage regimen utilizing the Factor IXa inhibitors is selected in accordance with a variety of factors including type, species, age, weight, sex and medical condition of the patient; the severity of the condition to be treated; the route of administration; the renal and hepatic function of the patient; and the particular compound or salt thereof employed. An ordinarily skilled physician or veterinarian can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the drug required to prevent, counter, or arrest the progress of the condition. Oral dosages of the Factor IXa inhibitors, when used for the indicated effects, will range between about 0.01 mg per kg of body weight per day (mg/kg/day) to about 30 mg/kg/day, preferably 0.025-7.5 mg/kg/day, more preferably 0.1-2.5 mg/kg/day, and most preferably 0.1-0.5 mg/kg/day (unless specified otherwise, amounts of active ingredients are on free base basis). For example, an 80 kg patient would receive between about 0.8 mg/day and 2.4 g/day, preferably 2-600 mg/day, more preferably 8-200 mg/day, and most preferably 8-40 mg/kg/day. A suitably prepared medicament for once a day administration would thus contain between 0.8 mg and 2.4 g, preferably between 2 mg and 600 mg, more preferably between 8 mg and 200 mg, and most preferably 8 mg and 40 mg, e.g., 8 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg and 40 mg. Advantageously, the Factor IXa inhibitors may be administered in divided doses of two, three, or four times daily. For administration twice a day, a suitably prepared medicament would contain between 0.4 mg and 4 g, preferably between 1 mg and 300 mg, more preferably between 4 mg and 100 mg, and most preferably 4 mg and 20 mg, e.g., 4 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg. Intravenously, the patient would receive the active ingredient in quantities sufficient to deliver between 0.025-7.5 mg/kg/day, preferably 0.1-2.5 mg/kg/day, and more preferably 0.1-0.5 mg/kg/day. Such quantities may be administered in a number of suitable ways, e.g. large volumes of low concentrations of active ingredient during one extended period of time or several times a day, low volumes of high concentrations of active ingredient during a short period of time, e.g. once a day. Typically, a conventional intravenous formulation may be prepared which contains a concentration of active ingredient of between about 0.01-1.0 mg/ml, e.g. 0.1 mg/ml, 0.3 mg/ml, and 0.6 mg/ml, and administered in amounts per day of between 0.01 ml/kg patient weight and 10.0 ml/kg patient weight, e.g. 0.1 ml/kg, 0.2 ml/kg, 0.5 ml/kg. In one example, an 80 kg patient, receiving 8 ml twice a day of an intravenous formulation having a concentration of active ingredient of 0.5 mg/ml, receives 8 mg of active ingredient per day. Glucuronic acid, L-lactic acid, acetic acid, citric acid or any pharmaceutically acceptable acid/conjugate base with reasonable buffering capacity in the pH range acceptable for intravenous administration may be used as buffers. The choice of appropriate buffer and pH of a formulation, depending on solubility of the drug to be administered, is readily made by a person having ordinary skill in the art. Compounds of the Formula (I) can be administered both as a monotherapy and in combination or together with all antithrombotics (anticoagulants and platelet aggregation inhibitors), thrombolytics (plasminogen activators of any type), other profibrinolytically active substances, hypotensives, blood sugar regulators, lipid-lowering agents and antiarrhythmics. The inhibitory effectiveness of compounds of the present invention to the coagulation factors XIa, Vila, IXa, Xa, plasma kallikrein or thrombin, can be determined using a relevant purified serine protease, respectively, and an appropriate synthetic substrate. PHARMACOLOGICAL EXAMPLES (1) Determination of inhibitory activity against factor IXa Inhibitory activity against factor IXa was tested using the substrate SPECTROFLUOR FIXa (american diagnostica inc.; 500 West Avenue, Stamford, CT 06902 USA; Pr. No. 299F) and human factor IXa (american diagnostica inc.; Pr. No. 449b). Test substances were dissolved in buffer A (50 mM α,α,α-tris (hydroxymethyl) methylamine (Tris), 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 15 %(v/v) ethylene glycol, pH 8.0) were mixed with factor IXa (0.1 μg/ml final concentration). The enzyme reaction was started by addition of SPECTROFLUOR FIXa (100 μΜ final concentration). After incubation for 60 minutes at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 %(v/v) acetic acid solution, and then the fluorescence value was measured (Excitation Wavelength:355nm, Emission Wavelength;460nm) in a microtiter plate reader (ARVO 1420 Multilabel Counter; PerkinElmer). The IC50 was calculated from a dilution series of the test substance with the aid of the software, Symyx Assay Explorer (Symyx Technologies, Inc.).

In one embodiment, the compounds of the present invention were selective factor IXa inhibitors, i.e., selective for factor IXa over other coagulation factors, such as factor Xa. (2) Determination of inhibitory activity against factor Xa This measuring was performed as well as Factor IXa method excluding the following conditions. As substrate and enzyme, SPECTROFLUOR FXa (american diagnostica inc.; Pr. No. 222F, 100 μΜ final concentration) and human factor Xa (american diagnostica inc.; Pr. No. 526, 44 ng/ml final concentration) were used respectively. Test substances were dissolved in buffer B (20 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, pH 8.0). Selectivity calculation Selectivity for Factor IXa activity over Factor Xa activity can be determined by the following calculation.: (IC50 Factor Xa) / (IC50 Factor IXa). Similar calculations can be made for selectivity of compounds for Factor IXa compared to other coagulation factors. These as well as other ways of minimizing contact between the components of combination products of the present invention, whether administered in a single dosage form or administered in separate forms but at the same time by the same manner, will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, once armed with the present disclosure. (3) Solubility Test (i) DMSO Precipitation Solubility (Kinetic Solubility) A 10 mM solution of the compound of the invention in DMSO is added to 50 mM phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) in a final concentration of 100 μΜ. The solution is incubated at room temperature for 1.5 hours while stirring at 600 rpm, and then filtered through a filter plate (4 um, MultiScreen Solubility Filter Plate (Millipore)). Absorbance of the filtrate is measured on a plate reader (Powerscan HT (Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.)) at the maximum absorption wavelength. At the same time, solutions containing the test compound of known concentrations (1, 3, 10, 30 and 100 μΜ) are prepared as standard solutions for calibration; absorbance in each of the standard solutions in different concentrations is measured to prepare a calibration curve. The solubility (μΜ) of the compound is determined from the absorbance values of the filtrate and standard solutions. (4) Metabolic Stability Test A 10 mM solution of the compound of the invention in DMSO is added to a liver microsome solution (human, rat; XenoTech) and NADPH-regenerating solution (water containing β-NADP, glucose-6-phosphate, G-6-PDH(Y) and MgCl2) in a final concentration of 1 μΜ. After incubation of the solution at 37°C for 10 minutes or 20 minutes, the reaction is stopped by addition of acetonitrile. The reaction solution is centrifuged and filtered through a filter plate (MultiScreen HTS-HV Plate (Millipore)). A test compound in the filtrate is measured using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Likewise, a sample with 0 reaction time is measured as a control, and the metabolic clearance ^L/min/mg protein) and the degradation rate (%) are determined by comparing the microsome reaction sample with the control. (5) hERG Inhibitory Test by Patch Clamp Method An effect on hERG (a human ether-a-go-go related gene) channel is measured with a fully automated patch-clamp system (Patchliner (Nanion) or QPatch HT (Sophion Bioscience)). To confirm the hERG Ικτ current in cells, a depolarization pulse is applied on a regular basis, while membrane potential is clamped at -80 mV. After the generated current is stabilized, a test compound is added to a perfusate. The effect of the test compound on the hERG channel is confirmed by changes in tail current induced by applying depolarization pulses having a voltage of 40 mV (Patchliner) or 20 mV (QPAtch) and subsequent repolarization pulse having a voltage of -40 mV (Patchliner) or -50 mM (QPatch). The stimulus is given once every 10 seconds (Patchliner) or 15 seconds (QPatch). The measurement is performed at room temperature. The hERG channel inhibitory activity is calculated as a reduction ratio (suppression rate) of the tail current 2 minutes before addition of a test compound, when compared to the maximum tail current. Calculation of this inhibitory activity enables to estimate the drug-induced QT prolongation and subsequent fatal adverse effects (ventricular tachycardia, sudden death, etc.). The preferred compounds of the invention show the hERG (human ether-a-go-go related gene) inhibitory activity not less than 10 μΜ in terms of the IC50 value. (6) Plasma Protein Binding Rate Test A 10 mM solution of the compound of the invention in DMSO is added to normal plasma (human, rat) in a final concentration of 10 μΜ. After dialysis at 37°C for 4 hours with a rapid equilibrium dialysis device (RED Device (Linden Bioscience) or HTD96b (HTDialysis)), the solution of plasma side and the solution opposite to the dialysis membrane (PBS side) are subjected to LC-MS/MS to measure the test compound in the samples. The fraction unbound (%) is calculated from a ratio of the PBS side to the plasma side, and the plasma protein binding rate (%) is calculated from 100 - the fraction unbound (%). (7) Permeability in MDCKII cell monolayers The permeability was evaluated by measuring transepithelial flux, using MDCKII cells. The cells were cultured for 3 days after seeding and grown to confluency on permeable polycarbonate membrane inserts, to permit flux experiments after loading on the apical side. The concentrations of the permeated compound of the invention were measured by LC-MS/MS. The flux across the MDCKIl cell monolayers were linear with time for up to 1 h. 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) was used for loading buffer on the apical side and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 4% BSA was used for buffer on the basolateral side. Pharmacological Experiment 7: Pharmacokinetics Test (Rat Cassette PK) The compound of the invention is administering to male SD rats of 7 to 9 weeks old at a dose of lmg/kg (solvent for administration, DMSO : Tween 80 : water = 1 : 1 :8, 10 mL/kg). Subsequently, blood is collected from the jugular vein 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 hours after the administration. Blood is centrifuged and plasma is obtained. The test compound in the plasma is extracted using organic solvents and measured using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Likewise, concentrations ^g/mL) in the plasma is determined from a calibration curve prepared using standard solutions of the test compound having the known concentrations. The maximum plasma concentration is expressed as Cmax ^g/mL). The present invention is not to be limited in scope by the specific embodiments disclosed in the examples which are intended as illustrations of a few aspects of the invention and any embodiments that are functionally equivalent are within the scope of this invention. Indeed, various modifications of the invention in addition to those shown and described herein will become apparent to those skilled in the relevant art and are intended to fall within the scope of the appended claim. A number of references have been cited, the entire disclosures of which have been incorporated herein in their entirety. The compounds of the present invention may also be useful as inhibitors of additional serine protease, notably human thrombin, human plasma kallikrein and human plasmin. Because of their inhibitory action, these compounds are indicated for use in the prevention or treatment of physiological reactions, as it were "Conditions" including thromboembolic disorder (arterial cardiovascular thromboembolic disorders, venous cardiovascular thromboembolic disorders, thromboembolic disorders in the chambers of the heart, unstable angina, an acute coronary syndrome, atrial fibrillation, first myocardial infarction, recurrent myocardial infarction, ischemic sudden death, transient ischemic attack, stroke, atherosclerosis, peripheral occlusive arterial disease, venous thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, arterial embolism, coronary arterial thrombosis, cerebral arterial thrombosis, cerebral embolism, kidney embolism, pulmonary embolism, and thrombosis resulting from (a) prosthetic valves or other implants, (b) indwelling catheters, (c) stents, (d) cardiopulmonary bypass, (e) hemodialysis, or (f) other procedures in which blood is exposed to an artificial surface that promotes thrombosis), blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, blood pressure regulation and inflammation, and wound healing catalyzed by the aforesaid class of enzymes. Specifically, the compounds have utility as drugs for the treatment of diseases arising from elevated thrombin activity of the aforementioned serine proteases, such as myocardial infarction, and as reagents used as anticoagulants in the processing of blood to plasma for diagnostic and other commercial purposes. The compounds of the present invention can be administered alone or in combination with one or more additional therapeutic agents. These include antithrombotics (anti-coagulant or coagulation inhibitory agents anti-platelet or platelet inhibitory agents or platelet aggregation inhibitors), anti-inflammatory agents, thrombin inhibitors, thrombolytics (plasminogen activators) or fibrinolytic agents, other profibrinolytically active substances, thrombin receptor (PAR-1) antagonist, hypotensives, blood sugar regulators, lipid- lowering agents, antiarrhythmics, a factor IXa inhibitor different from the compound of claim 1 , a factor Vila inhibitor, a factor Villa inhibitor, a factor Xa inhibitor, factor XIa inhibitors, factor Xlla inhibitors, TAFI, adenosine diphosphate antiplatelet agents (e.g., P2Y12 antagonists), fibrinogen inhibitors (fibrinogen receptor antagonists) (e.g. to treat or prevent unstable angina or to prevent reocclusion after angioplasty and restenosis), other anticoagulants such as aspirin, and thrombolytic agents such as plasminogen activators or streptokinase to achieve synergistic effects in the treatment of various vascular pathologies. Such anticoagulants include, for example, apixaban, dabigatran, cangrelor, ticagrelor, vorapaxar, clopidogrel, edoxaban, mipomersen, prasugrel, rivaroxaban, and semuloparin. For example, patients suffering from coronary artery disease, and patients subjected to angioplasty procedures, would benefit from coadministration of fibrinogen receptor antagonists and thrombin inhibitors. Factor IXa inhibitors may be administered first following thrombus formation, and tissue plasminogen activator or other plasminogen activator is administered thereafter. The compounds are administered to a mammal in a therapeutically effective amount. By "therapeutically effective amount" it is meant an amount of a compound of the present invention that, when administered alone or in combination with an additional therapeutic agent to a mammal, is effective to treat (i.e. prevent, inhibit or ameliorate) the thromboembolic and/or inflammatory disease condition or treat the progression of the disease in a host. The compounds of the invention are preferably administered alone to a mammal in a therapeutically effective amount. However, the compounds of the invention can also be administered in combination with an additional therapeutic agent, as defined below, to a mammal in a therapeutically effective amount. When administered in a combination, the combination of compounds in preferably, but not necessarily, a synergistic combination. Synergy, as described for example by Chou and Talalay, Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984, 22, 27-55, occurs when the effect (in this case, inhibition of the desired target) of the compounds when administered in combination is greater than the additive effect of the compounds when administered alone as a single agent. In general, a synergistic effect is most clearly demonstrated at suboptimal concentrations of the compounds. Synergy can be in terms of lower cytotoxicity, increased anticoagulant effect, or some other beneficial effect of the combination compared with the individual components. By "administered in combination" or "combination therapy" it is meant that the compound of the present invention and one or more additional therapeutic agents are administered concurrently to the mammal being treated. When administered in combination each component may be administered at the same time or sequentially in any order at different points in time. Thus, each component may be administered separately but sufficiently closely in time so as to provide the desired therapeutic effect. Compounds which can be administered in combination with the compounds of the present invention include, but are not limited to, anticoagulants, anti-thrombin agents, anti-platelet agents, fibrinolytics, hypolipidemic agents, antihypertensive agents, and anti-ischemic agents. Other anticoagulant agents (or coagulation inhibitory agents) that may be used in combination with the compounds of this invention include warfarin, heparin (either unfractionated heparin or any commercially available low molecular weight heparin, for example LOVANO), aprotinin, synthetic pentasaccharide, direct acting thrombin inhibitors including hirudin and argatroban, as well as other factor Vila inhibitor, Villa inhibitor, IXa inhibitor, Xa inhibitor, XIa inhibitor, thrombin inhibitor, fibrinogen inhibitors, TAFI, and known in the art. Factor IXa inhibitors different from the compounds of Formula (I) include synthetic active-site blocked competitive inhibitors, oral inhibitors and R A aptamers. These are described in the previously cited Howard et al. reference (Howard, EL, Becker KC, Rusconi, CP, Becker RC. Factor IXa Inhibitors as Novel Anticoagulants. Arterioscler Thromb Vase Biol. 2007; 27: 722-727.). The term anti-platelet agents (or platelet inhibitory agents), as used herein, denotes agents that inhibit platelet function, for example, by inhibiting the aggregation, adhesion or granular secretion of platelets. Such agents include, but are not limited to, the various known non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, sulindac, indomethacin, mefenamate, droxicam, diclofenac, sulfinpyrazone, and piroxicam, including pharmaceutically acceptable salts or prodrugs thereof. Of the NSAIDS, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid or ASA), and piroxicam are preferred.

The term anti-platelet agents (or platelet inhibitory agents), as used herein, is also intended to include ADP (adenosine diphosphate) receptor antagonists, preferably antagonists of the purinergic receptors P2Y1 and P2Y12 with P2Y12 being even more preferred. Preferred P2Y12 receptor antagonists include ticlopidine and clopidogrel, including pharmaceutically acceptable salts or prodrugs thereof. Clopidogrel is an even more preferred agent. Ticlopidine and clopidogrel are also preferred compounds since they are known to be gentle on the gastro-intestinal tract in use. The compounds of the present invention may also be dosed in combination with aprotinin. The term thrombin inhibitors (or anti-thrombin agents), as used herein, denotes inhibitors of the serine protease thrombin. By inhibiting thrombin, various thrombin-mediated processes, such as thrombin-mediated platelet activation (that is, for example, the aggregation of platelets, and/or the granular secretion of plasminogen activator inhibitor-I and/or serotonin), endothelial cell activation, inflammatory reactions, and/or fibrin formation are disrupted. A number of thrombin inhibitors are known to one of skill in the art and these inhibitors are contemplated to be used in combination with the present compounds. Such inhibitors include, but are not limited to, boroarginine derivatives, boropeptides, heparins, hirudin and argatroban, including pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs thereof. Boroarginine derivatives and boropeptiders include N-acetyl and peptide derivatives of boronic acid, such as C-terminal alpha-aminoboronic acid derivatives of lysine, ornithine, arginine, homoarginine and corresponding isothiouronium analogs thereof. The term hirudin, as used herein, includes suitable derivatives or analogs of hirudin, referred to herein as hirulogs, such as disulfatohirudin. The term "thrombin receptor antagonists", also known as protease activated receptor (PAR) antagonists or PAR-1 antagonists, are useful in the treatment of thrombotic, inflammatory, atherosclerotic and fibroproliferative disorders, as well as other disorders in which thrombin and its receptor play a pathological role. Thrombin receptor antagonist peptides have been identified based on structure-activity studies involving substitutions of amino acids on thrombin receptors. In Bernatowicz et al, J. Med. Chem., vol. 39, pp. 4879-4887 (1996), tetra-and pentapeptides are disclosed as being potent thrombin receptor antagonists, for example N-trans-cinnamoyl-p-fluoroPhe-p-guanidinoPhe-Leu-Arg-NH2 and N-trans-cinnamoyl-p-fluoroPhe-p-guanidinoPhe-Leu-Arg-Arg-NH2.
