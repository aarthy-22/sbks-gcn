Irbesartan: a review of its use in hypertension and diabetic nephropathy.
Irbesartan (Aprovel, Avapro, Irbetan, Karvea), an angiotensin II receptor type 1 antagonist, is approved in many countries worldwide for the treatment of hypertension.
It is also approved in some regions for the treatment of nephropathy in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
In adults with essential hypertension, irbesartan is effective at reducing blood pressure (BP) over a 24-hour period with once-daily administration.
Irbesartan also slows the progression of renal disease in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, with this effect partly independent of its BP-lowering effect.
In addition, irbesartan was generally well tolerated in clinical trials.
Thus, irbesartan is a useful treatment option for patients with hypertension, including those with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy.
