Conivaptan: promise of treatment in heart failure.
Conivaptan, the first vasopressin receptor antagonist approved by the FDA, is available for the treatment of hyponatremia in euvolemic and hypervolemic patients.
The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is activated in heart failure (HF) causing clinical worsening.
Arginine vasopressin levels are also elevated in HF.
Conivaptan is an effective and FDA approved for the treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia and may offer an extra treatment option in HF by targeting V(1a) and V(2) receptors.
In this article we review the physiology, preclinical studies as well as the human clinical studies on the use of conivaptan and its potential and promise in the treatment of HF.
