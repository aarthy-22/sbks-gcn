TECHNICAL FIELD This application relates to efficient and economical synthetic chemical processes for the preparation of pesticidal thioether and pesticidal sulfoxides. Further, the present application relates to certain novel compounds necessary for their synthesis. It would be advantageous to produce pesticidal thioether and pesticidal sulfoxides efficiently and in high yield from commercially available starting materials. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The following definitions apply to the terms as used throughout this specification, unless otherwise limited in specific instances. As used herein, the term “alkyl” denotes branched or unbranched hydrocarbon chains. Unless otherwise indicated, the term “cycloalkyl” as employed herein alone is a saturated cyclic hydrocarbon group, such as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl. The term “thio” as used herein as part of another group refers to a sulfur atom serving as a linker between two groups. The term “halogen” or “halo” as used herein alone or as part of another group refers to chlorine, bromine, fluorine, and iodine. The compounds and process of the present application are described in detail below. In step a of Scheme 1, 3-hydrazinopyridine dihydrochloride is reacted with glyoxylic acid to yield (E)-2-(2-(pyridin-3-yl)hydrazono)acetic acid (6a). The reaction can be done with or without an acid, it is preferred, however, that an acid is used. For example, it is preferred that hydrochloric acid (HCl) is used. This reaction may be conducted in a protic solvent, for example, water. This reaction may be conducted at temperatures from about 0° C. to about 30° C. In step b of Scheme 1, compound (6a) is reacted with acrylonitrile and a source of chlorine to yield 3-chloro-1-(pyridin-3-yl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-5-carbonitrile (6b). The chlorine source may be, for example, N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS). The reaction is also conducted in the presence of an inorganic base, preferably metal carbonates, metal hydroxides, metal phosphates, or metal hydrides, more preferably, potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3). The reaction is also conducted in a polar aprotic solvent, preferably, ethyl acetate (EtOAc). This reaction may be conducted at temperatures from about −10° C. to about 30° C. In step c of Scheme 1, compound (6b) undergoes dehydrocyanation to yield 3-(3-chloro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine (5b). This reaction is conducted in the presence of an organic or inorganic base that promotes the dehydrocyanation, such as, 1,8-diazabicyclo-[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU), 1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene (DBN), or potassium hydroxide. The reaction may be conducted in a polar solvent, such as N,N-dimethyl-formamide (DMF), ethanol (EtOH), or tetrahydrofuran (THF). This reaction may be conducted at temperatures from about −10° C. to about 30° C. In step d of Scheme 1, compound (5b) is nitrated with nitric acid (HNO3), preferably in the presence of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) to yield 3-(3-chloro-4-nitro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine (5c). The nitration may be conducted at temperatures from about −10° C. to about 30° C. In step e of Scheme 1, compound (5c) is reduced to yield 3-chloro-1-(pyridin-3-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-amine (5d). For example, compound (5c) may be reduced with iron in acetic acid (AcOH). Compound (5c) may also be reduced with iron and ammonium chloride (NH4Cl). Alternatively, this reduction may be carried out using other techniques in the art, for example, compound (5c) may be reduced using palladium on carbon in the presence of hydrogen (H2). This reaction may be conducted at temperatures from about −10° C. to about 30° C. In step g of Scheme 1,3-chloro-1-(pyridin-3-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-amine (5d) is acylated with acetylating agents such as acetyl chloride or acetic anhydride, preferably acetic anhydride (Ac2O) to yield N-(3-chloro-1-(pyridin-3-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)acetamide (1c). The acylation is conducted in the presence of a base, preferably an inorganic base, such as, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), and preferably, a polar solvent, such as ethyl acetate and/or tetrahydrofuran. This reaction may be conducted at temperatures from about −10° C. to about 30° C. In step h of Scheme 1, N-(3-chloro-1-(pyridin-3-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)acetamide (1c) is reduced to yield 3-chloro-N-ethyl-1-(pyridin-3-yl)-1H-pyrazol-amine (1d). The reaction is conducted in the presence of a hydride source, preferably sodium borohydride (NaBH4), and an acid source, such as a BrØnsted acid or a Lewis acid, preferably a Lewis acid, preferably borontrifluoride etherate (BF3.Et2O). It has been surprisingly discovered that the yield of the reaction is affected by the quality of the borontrifluoride etherate (purchased from different suppliers, currently, Sigma Aldrich product number 175501 being preferred). This reaction may be conducted at temperatures from about −10° C. to about 70° C. Alternatively, instead of steps g and h, in step f of Scheme 1, 3-chloro-1-(pyridin-3-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-amine (5d) is condensed with acetaldehyde followed by reduction of the imine intermediate to yield 3-chloro-N-ethyl-1-(pyridin-3-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-amine (1d). The reaction may be conducted with a hydride source such as sodium borohydride in a polar protic solvent, such as methanol (MeOH) at temperatures from about −10° C. to about 40° C. In step i of Scheme 1, 3-chloro-N-ethyl-1-(pyridin-3-yl)-1H-pyrazol-amine (1d) is reacted with an activated carbonyl thioether, indicated as X1C(═O)C1-C4-alkyl-S—R1, to yield pesticidal thioether (1e). R1 is selected from the group consisting of C1-C4-haloalkyl and C1-C4-alkyl-C3-C6-halocycloalkyl, preferably, R1 is selected from CH2CH2CF3 or CH2(2,2-difluorocyclopropyl). X1 is selected from Cl, OC(═O)C1-C4 alkyl, or a group that forms an activated carboxylic acid. When X1 is Cl or OC(═O)C1-C4 alkyl the reaction may be conducted in the presence of a base preferably, sodium bicarbonate to yield pesticidal thioether (1e). When X1 is Cl or OC(═O)C1-C4 alkyl the reaction may also be conducted in the absence of a base to yield pesticidal thioether (1e). Alternatively, the reaction may be accomplished when X1C(═O)C1-C4-alkyl-S—R1 is an activated carboxylic acid activated by such reagents as 2,4,6-tripropyl-trioxatriphosphinane-2,4,-trioxide (T3P), carbonyldiimidazole (CDI), dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) or 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC), preferably 2,4,6-tripropyl-trioxatriphosphinane-2,4,-trioxide and carbonyldiimidazole at temperatures from about 0° C. to about 80° C.; this reaction may also be facilitated with uronium or phosphonium activating groups such as 0-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU) or benzotriazol-1-yl-oxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP), in the presence of an amine base such as diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) or triethylamine (TEA) in an polar aprotic solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran or dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), at temperatures from about −10° C. to about 30° C. to form pesticidal thioethers (1e). Activated carbonyl thioethers, may be prepared from X1C(═O)C1-C4-alkyl-S—R1, wherein X1 is OH may be prepared by reacting the corresponding ester thioether, indicated as X1C(═O)C1-C4-alkyl-S—R1 wherein X1 is OC1-C4-alkyl, with a metal hydroxide such as lithium hydroxide (LiOH) in a polar solvent such as methanol or tetrahydrofuran. Alternatively, X1C(═O)C1-C4-alkyl-S—R1, wherein X1 is OH or OC1-C4-alkyl may be prepared by the photochemical free-radical coupling of 3-mercaptopropionic acid and esters thereof with 3,3,3-trifluoropropene in the presence of 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone initiator and long wavelength UV light in an inert organic solvent. While stoichiometric amounts of 3-mercaptopropionic acid or esters thereof and 3,3,3-trifluoropropene are required, because of its low boiling point, excess 3,3,3-trifluoropropene is usually employed to compensate for routine losses. From about 1 to about 10 mole percent initiator, 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenyl-acetophenone, is typically used, with about 5 mole percent being preferred. Long wavelength UV light is sometimes called “black light” and ranges from about 400 to about 365 nanometers. The photochemical coupling is conducted in an inert organic solvent. Typical inert organic solvents must remain liquid to about −50° C., must remain relatively inert to the free radical conditions and must dissolve the reactants at reaction temperatures. Preferred inert organic solvents are aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons like toluene. The temperature at which the reaction is conducted is not critical but usually is from about −50° C. to about 35° C. Lower temperatures, however, are better for increased selectivity. Initially, it is important to keep the temperature below the boiling point of 3,3,3-trifluoropropene, i.e., about −18 to about −16° C. In a typical reaction, the inert organic solvent is cooled to less than about −50° C. and the 3,3,3-trifluoropropene is bubbled into the solvent. The 3-mercaptopropionic acid or esters thereof and 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone are added and a long wave function (366 nm) UVP lamp (4 watt) is turned on. After sufficient conversion of 3-mercapto-propionic acid or esters thereof, the light is turned off and the solvent removed. 3-((3,3,3-Trifluoropropyl)thio)propanoic acid may also be prepared by the low temperature free-radical initiated coupling of 3-mercaptopropionic acid with 3,3,3-trifluoropropene in the presence of 2,2′-azobis(4-methoxy-2,4-dimethyl) valeronitrile (V-70) initiator at temperatures of about −50° C. to about 40° C. in an inert organic solvent. While stoichiometric amounts of 3-mercaptopropionic acid and 3,3,3-trifluoropropene are required, because of its low boiling point, excess 3,3,3-trifluoropropene is usually employed to compensate for routine losses. From about 1 to about 10 mole percent initiator, V-70, is typically used, with about 5 mole percent being preferred. The low temperature free-radical initiated coupling is conducted in an inert organic solvent. Typical inert organic solvents must remain liquid to about −50° C., must remain relatively inert to the free radical conditions and must dissolve the reactants at reaction temperatures. Preferred inert organic solvents are toluene, ethyl acetate, and methanol. The temperature at which the reaction is conducted from about −50° C. to about 40° C. Initially, it is important to keep the temperature below the boiling point of 3,3,3-trifluoropropene, i.e., about −18 to about −16° C. The solution is cooled to less than about −50° C. and the 3,3,3-trifluoropropene is transferred into the reaction mixture. After stirring at room temperature for 24 hours, the reaction mixture is heated to about 50° C. for about 1 hour to decompose any remaining V-70 initiator followed by cooling and solvent removal. In step j of Scheme 1, thioether (1e) is oxidized with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in methanol to yield pesticidal sulfoxides (if). 3-(3-Chloro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine (5b) may alternatively be prepared through the reaction pathway disclosed in Scheme 2. In step a of Scheme 2, (E)-2-(2-(pyridin-3-yl)hydrazono)acetic acid (6a) is reacted with methyl acrylate in the presence of a chlorine source such N-chlorosuccinimide, an inorganic base, preferably metal carbonates, metal hydroxides, metal phosphates, or metal hydrides, more preferably potassium bicarbonate and a polar aprotic solvent, preferably, ethyl acetate, and addition of a sub-stoichiometric amount of water to yield methyl 3-chloro-1-(pyridin-3-yl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxylate (6c). This reaction may be conducted at temperatures from about −10° C. to about 30° C. In step b of Scheme 2, methyl 3-chloro-1-(pyridin-3-yl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxylate (6c) is oxidized with diammonium cerium (IV) nitrate (CAN) in water and polar solvents such as tetrahydrofuran at temperatures from about 0° C. to about 30° C. to yield methyl 3-chloro-1-(pyridin-3-yl)-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxylate (6d). It was surprisingly discovered that the oxidation in step b can also proceed with potassium permanganate (KMnO4) as the oxidant in polar solvents such as acetone at temperatures from about 0° C. to about 30° C. However, many standard oxidation procedures such as, for example potassium persulfate (K2S2O8), iodine pentoxide (I2O5), copper oxide (CuO), and hydrogen peroxide were found to be inoperative. In step c of Scheme 2, methyl 3-chloro-1-(pyridin-3-yl)-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxylate (6d) is saponified in the presence of an inorganic base, preferably metal hydroxides or their hydrates such as lithium hydroxide hydrate (LiOH.H2O) in water and a polar solvent such as dioxane at temperatures from about 0° C. to about 30° C. to yield 3-chloro-1-(pyridin-3-yl)-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxylic acid (6e). Alternatively, this process can also be accomplished by hydrolysis by exposing methyl 3-chloro-1-(pyridin-3-yl)-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxylate (6d) to a concentrated acid such as hydrochloric acid in water at temperatures from about 30° C. to about 100° C. In step d of Scheme 2, 3-chloro-1-(pyridin-3-yl)-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxylic acid (6e) is decarboxylated in the presence of copper (II) oxide in polar solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide at temperatures from about 80° C. to about 140° C. to yield 3-(3-chloro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine (5b). It was surprisingly discovered that this decarboxylation only occurs in the presence of copper (II) oxide. Several known decarboxylation agents from the literature such as, for example, hydrochloric acid (See alternate synthetic route, Example 14), sulfuric acid, and palladium (II) trifluoroacetate/trifluoroacetic acid (Pd(TFA)2/TFA) (See “CE-5”) did not yield the desired product. 3-Chloro-N-ethyl-1-(pyridin-3-yl)-1H-pyrazol-amine (1d) may be prepared through the reaction pathway sequence disclosed in Scheme 3. In step d1, N-(3-chlorol-(pyridin-3-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)acetamide (1c) may be alkylated with ethyl bromide (EtBr) in the presence of a base, such as sodium hydride (NaH), sodium tert-butoxide (NaOt-Bu), potassium tert-butoxide (KOt-Bu), or sodium tert-amyloxide, in a polar aprotic solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran, at temperatures from about 20° C. to about 40° C., over a period of time of about 60 hours to about 168 hours, to yield N-(3-chloro-1-(pyridin-3-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-N-ethylacetamide (1c′). It has been discovered that use of an iodide additive, such as potassium iodide (KI) or tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI) can decrease the time necessary for the reaction to occur to about 24 hours. It has also been discovered that heating the reaction at about 50° C. to about 70° C. in a sealed reactor (to prevent loss of ethyl bromide) also decreases the reaction time to about 24 hours. In step d2, N-(3-chloro-1-(pyridin-3-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-N-ethylacetamide (1c′) may be treated with hydrochloric acid in water at temperatures from about 50° C. to about 90° C., to yield 3-chloro-N-ethyl-1-(pyridin-3-yl)-1H-pyrazol-amine (1d). The reaction pathway sequence disclosed in Scheme 3 may also be performed without the isolation of N-(3-chloro-1-(pyridin-3-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-N-ethylacetamide (1c′). In step a of Scheme 4, 3-hydrazinopyridine-dihydrochloride is treated with a di-C1-C4 alkyl maleate such as diethyl maleate in a C1-C4 aliphatic alcohol at a temperature of about 25° C. to about 100° C. in the presence of an alkali metal C1-C4 alkoxide to provide pyrazolidine carboxylate (10a). While stoichiometric amounts of 3-hydrazinopyridine.-dihydrochloride and di-C1-C4 alkyl maleate are required, it is often convenient to use about a 1.5 fold to about a 2 fold excess of di-C1-C4 alkyl maleate. The cyclization is run in the presence of an alkali metal C1-C4 alkoxide base such as sodium ethoxide. It is often convenient to use about a 2 fold to about a 5 fold excess of base. The cyclization is performed in a C1-C4 aliphatic alcohol such as ethanol. It is most convenient that the alkoxide base and the alcohol solvent be the same, for example, sodium ethoxide in ethanol. In step b of Scheme 4, the pyrazolidine carboxylate (10a) may be treated with a chlorinating reagent in an inert organic solvent at a temperature of about 25° C. to about 100° C. to provide chlorinated dihydropyrazole carboxylate (10b). Suitable chlorinating reagents include phosphoryl trichloride and phosphorus pentachloride. Phosphoryl trichloride is preferred. It is often convenient to use about a 1.1 fold to about a 10 fold excess of the chlorinating reagent. The chlorination is performed in an organic solvent that is inert to the chlorinating reagent. Suitable solvents include nitriles such as acetonitrile. With phosphoryl trichloride as the chlorinating reagent, acetonitrile is a preferred solvent. In step c of Scheme 4, chlorinated dihydropyrazole carboxylate (10b) may treated with an oxidant in an organic solvent at a temperature of about 25° C. to about 100° C. to provide chlorinated pyrazole carboxylate (10c). Suitable oxidants include manganese (IV) oxide and sodium persulfate/sulfuric acid. It is often convenient to use about a 1.5 fold to about a 15 fold excess of oxidant. The oxidation is performed in an organic solvent that is inert to the oxidant. Suitable solvents include nitriles such as acetonitrile. With manganese (IV) oxide (MnO2) or sodium persulfate/sulfuric acid as the oxidant, acetonitrile is a preferred solvent. In step d of Scheme 4, chlorinated pyrazole carboxylate (10c) may then be converted to the desired 3-chloro-1-(pyridin-3-yl)-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxylic acid hydrochloride (6e) by treatment in aqueous hydrochloric acid at a temperature of about 25° C. to about 100° C. While stoichiometric amounts of reagents are required, it is often convenient to use an excess of reagents with respect to the chlorinated pyrazole carboxylate. Thus, aqueous hydrochloric acid is used in large excess as the reaction medium. Alternatively, chlorinated pyrazole carboxylates may be saponified in the presence of an inorganic base, preferably metal hydroxides or their hydrates such as lithium hydroxide hydrate (LiOH.H2O) in water and a polar solvent such as dioxane at temperatures from about 0° C. to about 30° C. to yield 3-chloro-1-(pyridin-3-yl)-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxylic acid (6e). In step e of Scheme 4, 3-chloro-1-(pyridin-3-yl)-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxylic acid hydrochloride (6e) is decarboxylated in the presence of copper (II) oxide in polar solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide at temperatures from about 80° C. to about 140° C. to yield 3-(3-chloro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine (5b). It was surprisingly discovered that this decarboxylation only occurs in the presence of copper (II) oxide. Several known decarboxylation agents from the literature such as, for example, hydrochloric acid (See alternate synthetic route, Example 14), sulfuric acid, and palladium (II) trifluoroacetate/trifluoroacetic acid (See “CE-5”) did not yield the desired product. EXAMPLES The following examples are presented to better illustrate the processes of the present application.

The pure fractions were concentrated to dryness to afford a white solid after drying (1.84 g, 93%): 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ 8.75-8.64 (m, 2H), 7.79 (ddd, J=8.2, 2.6, 1.5 Hz, 1H), 7.42 (ddd, J=8.2, 4.8, 0.8 Hz, 1H), 6.98 (s, 1H), 4.27 (q, J=7.1 Hz, 2H), 1.27 (t, J=7.1 Hz, 3H); 13C NMR (101 MHz, CDCl3) δ 157.90, 149.88, 147.01, 141.41, 136.24, 135.27, 133.34, 123.11, 111.97, 61.87, 13.98; ESIMS m/z 252 ([M+H]+). Alternate synthetic route to: Ethyl 3-chloro-1-(pyridin-3-yl)-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxylate A vial (20 mL) was charged with ethyl 3-chloro-1-(pyridin-3-yl)-1H-dihydropyrazole-5-carboxylate (0.500 g, 1.97 mmol) and acetonitrile (5 mL). Sodium persulfate (0.799 g, 2.96 mmol) was added, followed by sulfuric acid (0.733 g, 7.88 mmol) (Exotherm!). The reaction was heated at 60° C. for 18 hours. The reaction was cooled to 20° C. and poured into water (20 mL). The mixture was basified with sodium carbonate to pH 9 and extracted with ethyl acetate (2×20 mL). The organic layers were concentrated to a residue, which was purified by flash column chromatography using 50% ethyl acetate/hexanes as eluent to provide the title compound as a white solid (0.280 g, 56%). Method Examples Example A Bioassays on Green Peach Aphid (“GPA”) (Myzus persicae) (MYZUPE.) GPA is the most significant aphid pest of peach trees, causing decreased growth, shriveling of leaves, and the death of various tissues. It is also hazardous because it acts as a vector for the transport of plant viruses, such as potato virus Y and potato leafroll virus to members of the nightshade/potato family Solanaceae, and various mosaic viruses to many other food crops. GPA attacks such plants as broccoli, burdock, cabbage, carrot, cauliflower, daikon, eggplant, green beans, lettuce, macadamia, papaya, peppers, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, watercress and zucchini among other plants. GPA also attacks many ornamental crops such as carnations, chrysanthemum, flowering white cabbage, poinsettia and roses. GPA has developed resistance to many pesticides. Several molecules disclosed herein were tested against GPA using procedures described below. Cabbage seedling grown in 3-in pots, with 2-3 small (3-5 cm) true leaves, were used as test substrate. The seedlings were infested with 20-5-GPA (wingless adult and nymph stages) one day prior to chemical application. Four posts with individual seedlings were used for each treatment. Test compounds (2 mg) were dissolved in 2 mL of acetone/methanol (1:1) solvent, forming stock solutions of 1000 ppm test compound. The stock solutions were diluted 5× with 0.025% Tween 20 in water to obtain the solution at 200 ppm test compound. A hand-held aspirator-type sprayer was used for spraying a solution to both sides of the cabbage leaves until runoff. Reference plants (solvent check) were sprayed with the diluent only containing 20% by volume acetone/methanol (1:1) solvent. Treated plants were held in a holding room for three days at approximately 25° C. and ambient relative humidity (RH) prior to grading. Evaluation was conducted by counting the number of live aphids per plant under a microscope. Percent Control was measured by using Abbott's correction formula (W. S. Abbott, “A Method of Computing the Effectiveness of an Insecticide” J. Econ. Entomol 18 (1925), pp. 265-267) as follows. [in-line-formulae]Corrected % Control=100*(X−Y)/X [/in-line-formulae]whereX=No. of live aphids on solvent check plants andY=No. of live aphids on treated plants The results are indicated in the table entitled “Table 1: GPA (MYZUPE) and sweetpotato whitefly-crawler (BEMITA) Rating Table”. Example B Bioassays on Sweetpotato Whitefly Crawler (Bemisia tabaci) (BEMITA.) The sweetpotato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius), has been recorded in the United States since the late 1800s. In 1986 in Florida, Bemisia tabaci became an extreme economic pest. Whiteflies usually feed on the lower surface of their host plant leaves. From the egg hatches a minute crawler stage that moves about the leaf until it inserts its microscopic, threadlike mouthparts to feed by sucking sap from the phloem. Adults and nymphs excrete honeydew (largely plant sugars from feeding on phloem), a sticky, viscous liquid in which dark sooty molds grow. Heavy infestations of adults and their progeny can cause seedling death, or reduction in vigor and yield of older plants, due simply to sap removal. The honeydew can stick cotton lint together, making it more difficult to gin and therefore reducing its value. Sooty mold grows on honeydew-covered substrates, obscuring the leaf and reducing photosynthesis, and reducing fruit quality grade. It transmitted plant-pathogenic viruses that had never affected cultivated crops and induced plant physiological disorders, such as tomato irregular ripening and squash silverleaf disorder. Whiteflies are resistant to many formerly effective pesticides. Cotton plants grown in 3-inch pots, with 1 small (3-5 cm) true leaf, were used at test substrate. The plants were placed in a room with whitefly adults. Adults were allowed to deposit eggs for 2-3 days. After a 2-3 day egg-laying period, plants were taken from the adult whitefly room. Adults were blown off leaves using a hand-held Devilbliss sprayer (23 psi). Plants with egg infestation (100-300 eggs per plant) were placed in a holding room for 5-6 days at 82° F. and 50% RH for egg hatch and crawler stage to develop. Four cotton plants were used for each treatment. Compounds (2 mg) were dissolved in 1 mL of acetone solvent, forming stock solutions of 2000 ppm. The stock solutions were diluted 10× with 0.025% Tween 20 in water to obtain a test solution at 200 ppm. A hand-held Devilbliss sprayer was used for spraying a solution to both sides of cotton leaf until runoff. Reference plants (solvent check) were sprayed with the diluent only. Treated plants were held in a holding room for 8-9 days at approximately 82° F. and 50% RH prior to grading. Evaluation was conducted by counting the number of live nymphs per plant under a microscope. Pesticidal activity was measured by using Abbott's correction formula (see above) and presented in Table 1.
