The preparation and human muscarinic receptor profiling of oxybutynin and N-desethyloxybutynin enantiomers.
Oxybutynin (1) is a non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist that is used clinically for the treatment of urinary incontinence.
The major metabolite of oxybutynin in humans is desethyloxybutynin (2).
We have prepared the enantiomers of 1 and 2 and evaluated their ability to displace N-CT(3)-scopolamine chloride ((3)H-NMS) binding on human cloned muscarinic m1-5 receptors.
Compounds 1 and 2 potently displaced (3)H-NMS binding at m1, m3 and m4 receptors, but were less potent at the m2 and m5 subtypes.
However, metabolite 2 was more potent than the parent compound 1 in the binding assay.
In general the R enantiomers were more potent than their respective S enantiomers.
Therefore, we suggest that the cholinergic side effects associated with 2 may be due to its greater apparent potency with m1 and m3 receptors, especially of its R-enantiomer, when compared with parent drug 1.
