Quantitative determination of fatty acid chain composition in pork meat products by high resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy.
High resolution (1)H NMR spectroscopy was proposed for the determination of the fatty acid chain profile of lipids in pork meat products during ripening.
Two typical Mediterranean PDO salami produced in Calabria, a region in the Southern Italy, were chosen as a case of study.
Quantitative NMR analysis provided the fatty acid chain profiles of total lipid extracts.
The transesterification of total lipid extracts furnished FAME mixtures that enabled quantitation of fatty acid acyl chains in the acylglycerol and FFA portions.
In all cases, oleyl chains were predominant, and high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acid chains were observed.
The proposed spectroscopic method allowed also the estimation of the most important nutritional parameters of dry fermented meat products.
