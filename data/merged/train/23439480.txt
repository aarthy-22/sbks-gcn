Ghrelin inhibits sodium metabisulfite induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in rat gastric mucosa.
This study aimed to investigate the effect of ghrelin administration on sulfite induced oxidative and apoptotic changes in rat gastric mucosa.
Forty male albino Wistar rats were randomized into control (C), sodium metabisulfite (Na2S2O5) treated (S), ghrelin treated (G) and, Na2S2O5+ghrelin treated (SG) groups.
Sodium metabisulfite (100mg/kg/day) was given by gastric gavage and, ghrelin (20μg/kg/day) was given intraperitoneally for 5weeks.
Plasma-S-sulfonate level was increased in S and SG groups.
Na2S2O5 administration significantly elevated total oxidant status (TOS) levels while depleting total antioxidant status (TAS) levels in gastric mucosa.
Ghrelin significantly decreased gastric TOS levels in the SG group compared with the S group.
Additionally, TAS levels were found to be higher in SG group in reference to S group.
Na2S2O5 administration also markedly increased the number of apoptotic cells, cleaved caspase-3 and PAR expression (PARP activity indicator) and, decreased Ki67 expression (cell proliferation index) in gastric mucosal cells.
Ghrelin treatment decreased the number apoptotic cells, cytochrome C release, PAR and, caspase-3 expressions while increasing Ki67 expression in gastric mucosa exposed to Na2S2O5.
In conclusion, we suggest that ghrelin treatment might ameliorate ingested-Na2S2O5 induced gastric mucosal injury stemming from apoptosis and oxidative stress in rats.
