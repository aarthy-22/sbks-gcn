The entirety of each of these applications is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes. GOVERNMENT INTEREST The U.S. Government has rights in this invention by virtue of support under Contract No. HHSN26120080000 IE awarded by the National Cancer Institute, National Institute of Health. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to the use of selected pyrimidine compounds having Mer tyrosine kinase (MerTK) inhibitory activity as anti-infective agents, immunostimulatory and immunomodulatory agents, anti-cancer agents (including against MerTK -/- tumors and ITD and TKD mutant forms of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)), and as adjunctive agents in combination with chemotherapeutic, radiation or other standard of care for neoplasms. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION MerTK is a member of a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family known as TAM, which also includes AXL and TYR03. Each member of the TAM family contains an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain and a conserved intracellular kinase domain. MerTK was first discovered in the laboratory of H. Shelton Earp at the University of North Carolina in 1994 (Graham et al., Cloning and mRNA expression analysis of a novel human protooncogene, c-mer. Cell Growth Differ 5, 647-657 (1994)). The TAM family members undergo ligand-induced homodimerization, followed by catalytic tyrosine kinase activation and intracellular signaling. Cross-phosphorylation has also been demonstrated within this RTK family, suggesting heterodimerization can occur also. These RTKs are widely expressed in many epithelial tissues and in cells of the immune, nervous, and reproductive systems. MerTK was given its name by the Earp laboratory because it was found to be expressed in monocytes and in tissues of epithelial and reproductive tissue. As described in more detail below, ligand-bound MerTK can complex with phosphatidyl serine and it binds apoptotic cells which triggers ingestion and suppresses inflammatory cytokines. It is aberrantly expressed in certain cancers (for example, acute leukemia (ALL and AML) and some solid tumors (for example melanoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, non-small cell lung carcinoma, glioblastoma and others). The MerTK ligands include growth arrest-specific 6 protein (GAS6; Chen, et al; Oncogene (1997) 14, 2033-2039), protein-S, tubby and tubbylike protein-1 (TULP1), and galectin-3. Several of these ligands are present in serum and expressed locally in a number of tissues. These ligands bind to the extracellular domain of MerTK, resulting in tyrosine kinase activation. Since the discovery of MerTK in the Earp laboratory in 1994, there has been a growing body of literature and patents that suggest the possibility of MerTK as a druggable target for a number of indications. TAM receptor tyrosine kinases have been investigated for their involvement in certain infectious diseases. Shimojima, et al., reported the involvement of members of the Tyro3 receptor tyrosine kinase family, Axl, Dkt and MerTK, in the cell entry of filoviruses Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus, and concluded that each Tyro3 family member is likely a cell entry factor in the infection ("Tyro3 Family-mediated Cell Entry of Ebola and Marburg Viruses" Journal of Virology, Oct 2006 p. 10109-10116). U.S. Patent No. 8,415,361 to Lemke, et al. (claiming priority to a November 9, 2007 provisional application), assigned to The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, describes the use of TAM receptor inhibitors as antimicrobials. In particular, the '361 patent reports that inhibition of the TAM pathway in virally infected macrophages from TAM triple knock-out mice leads to reduced levels of infection with a variety of pseudotyped viruses with either filoviral, retroviral or rhabdoviral glycoproteins. Brindley, et al., reported that in a bioinformatics-based screen for cellular genes that enhance Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) transduction, AXL mRNA expression strongly correlated with ZEBOV infection ("Tyrosine kinase receptor Axl enhances entry of Zaire ebolavirus without direct interactions with the viral glycoprotein" Virology, 415 (2011) 83-84). Morizono, et al, published that Gas6 mediates binding of the virus to target cells by bridging virion envelope phosphatidyl serine to Axl on the target cells. Replication of vaccinia virus, which was previously reported to use apoptotic mimicry to enter cells, is enhanced by Gas6, and Morizono asserts that these results reveal an alternative molecular mechanism of viral entry that can broaden host range and enhance infectivity of enveloped viruses ("The Soluble Serum Protein Gas6 Bridges Virion Envelope Phosphatidylserine to the TAM Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Axl to mediate Viral Entry" Cell Host & Microbe 9, 286- 298, 2011). In 2014, Morizono and Chen reported that virus binding by viral envelope phosphatidyl serine is a viral entry mechanism generalized to a number of families of viruses (Morizono and Chen, "Role of Phosphatidyl Receptors in Enveloped Virus Infection", J. Virology Vol 88(8), 4275-4290 (January 29, 2014)). WO2013/124324 filed by Amara et al. (priority date February 21, 2012), and assigned to Institut National De La Sante et De La Recherche Medicale, reports that Dengue virus is mediated by the interaction between phosphatidylserine at the surface of the Dengue viral envelope and TAM receptors present at the surface of the host cell, and that such interaction can be blocked, thereby inhibiting entry of Dengue into host cells. They also report that the interaction between phosphatidyl serine and TAM receptors is used by other flaviviruses such as Yellow Fever, West Nile and perhaps Chikungunya. Amara focuses on antisense, siRNA and antibody approaches. Similarly, Bhattacharayya et al., reports that several human viruses, for example Ebola, Dengue, and HIV, externalize PtdSer on their capsid during budding and use phosphatidylserine to bind to and activate TAM RTKs in the presence of TAM ligands, allowing entry of the virus into cells and furthermore, activation of MerTK in macrophages in response to viral particles expressing PtdSer stimulates an anti-inflammatory cytokine profile as if apoptotic material was being ingested, thereby inhibiting the anti-viral immune response. Bhattacharayya et al observe that TAM receptors are engaged by viruses to attenuate type 1 interferon signaling ("Enveloped viruses disable innate immune responses in dendritic cells by direct activation of TAM receptors", Cell Host & Microbe 14, 136,-147 (2013)). See also Meertens, L. et al. The TIM and TAM families of phosphatidylserine receptors mediate dengue virus entry. Cell Host Microbe 12, 544-557, doi.T0.1016/j.chom.2012.08.009 (2012). Mercer, J. & Helenius, A. Vaccinia virus uses macropinocytosis and apoptotic mimicry to enter host cells. Science 320, 531-535, doi:10.1126/science.l 155164 (2008). MerTK is ectopically expressed or overexpressed in a number of hematologic and epithelial malignant cells. Expression of MerTK and GAS6 correlates with poor prognosis and/or chemoresistance in these tumor types. The mechanisms by which increased MerTK signaling in tumor cells contributes to tumor malignancy, however, remain unclear. WO2013/177168 and WO2014/085225, both titled "Pyrimidine Compounds for the Treatment of Cancer" filed by Wang, et al., and assigned to the University of North Carolina describe pyrimidines with MerTK inhibitory activity for the treatment of tumors such as myeloid leukemia, lymphoblastic leukemia, melanoma, breast, lung, colon, liver, gastric, kidney, ovarian, uterine and brain cancer, wherein the pyrimidines have the general structures below, with R substituents as defined in the those applications: An important observation was made in 2013 that MerTK -/- knock-out mice are less susceptible to tumor growth than normal mice. MerTK is normally expressed in myeloid lineage cells where it acts to suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines following ingestion of apoptotic material. It was found that MerTK -/- leukocytes exhibit lower tumor cell-induced expression of wound healing cytokines (IL-10 and GAS 6) and enhanced expression of acute inflammatory cytokines (IL-12 and IL-6). Further, intratumoral CD8+ lymphocytes are increased. The loss of MerTK in the rumor microenvironment in Mer-/~ mice slowed the establishment, growth, and metastasis of mammary tumors and melanomas in immune competent, syngeneic mice. Cook, R.S. et al., MerTK inhibition in tumor leukocytes decreases tumor growth and metastasis, J Clin Invest 123, 3231-3242 (2013). Linger et al. have also presented data demonstrating increased MerTK expression in E2A-PBX11 and other cytogenetic subgroups of B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), and that MerTK inhibition may attenuate prosurvival and proliferation signaling. Linger et al., Mer receptor tyrosine kinase is a therapeutic target in pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Blood, vol. 122(9): 1599- 1609, 2013. Lee-Sherick, et al. ("Efficacy of a Mer and Flt3 tyrosine kinase small molecule inhibitor, UNCI 666, in acute myeloid leukemia", Oncotarget, Advance Publications 2015 Feb 10, 2015) have reported that UNC 1666 (a pyrrolopyrimidine) decreases oncogenic signaling and myeloid survival in AML. TAM (Tyro3-Axl-Mer) receptor tyrosine kinases have also been investigated for their involvement in platelet aggregation. In 2004, Chen et al, from the Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development, published that MerTK, presumably through activation by its ligand Gas6, participates in the regulation of platelet function in vitro and platelet-dependent thrombosis in vivo. Chen, et al, "Mer Receptor tyrosine Kinase Signaling Participates in Platelet Function", Arterioscler. Thromv Vase. Biol. 1118-1123 June 2004. Chen reported that PtdSer on aggregating platelets activates MerT , helping to stabilize clot formation. MerTK knockout mice have decreased platelet aggregation while maintaining normal bleeding times and coagulation parameters. Consequently, these mice appear to be protected from thrombosis without concomitant increased spontaneous bleeding (see also Angelillo-Scherrer A et al., Role of Gas6 receptors in platelet signaling during thrombus stabilization and implications for antithrombotic therapy. J. Clin. Invest. 2005, 115 (2), 237-246). In 2007, Sather, et al., reported that membrane-bound MerTK is cleaved in the extracellular domain via a metalloproteinase to produce a soluble MerTK that decreased platelet aggregation in vitro and prevented fatal collageri/epinephrine-induced thromboembolism. "A soluble form of the Mer receptor tyrosine kinase inhibits macrophage clearance of apoptotic cells and platelet aggregation", Blood, Vol 109(3): 1026-1033). In December 2013, Zhang, W., et al., published a comparison of the activity of forty seven 5-amidopyrimidine based compounds for treatment of thrombosis ("Discovery of Mer specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment and prevention of thrombosis", J. Med. Chem. vol. 56:9693-9700, 2013). MerTK, Axl and Tyro3 IC50 data were presented for the selected 5-amidopyrimidines, and observations about activity based on substitutions at the 5- amide and the 2- and 4-amino groups were discussed. The publication reported that the compound illustrated below appeared to have a particularly good activity profile: Tyro3 250 nM In December 2013, Zhang, W., et al., also published a comparison of the activity of forty six 5-arylpyrimidine based compounds for treatment of tumors "(Pseudo-cyclization through intramolecular hydrogen bond enables discovery of pyridine substituted pyrimidines as new Mer kinase inhibitors", J. Med. Chem., vol. 56:9683-9692, 2013). MerTK, Axl and Tyro3 IC50 data were presented for the selected 5-arylpyrimidines, and observations about activity based on substitutions at the 5-aryl and the 2- and 4-amino groups were discussed. Zhang, et al. highlighted UNC2250 as a potential lead compound: Axl 270 nM Tyro3 00 nM Paolino et al. have reported on the treatment of wild-type K cells with a newly developed small molecule TAM kinase inhibitor, LDC1267, that conferred therapeutic potential and efficiently enhancing anti-metastatic NK cell activity in vivo. Oral or intraperitoneal administration using this TAM inhibitor markedly reduced murine mammary cancer and melanoma metastases dependent on NK cells. See, Paolino, M., et al., The E3 ligase Cbl-b and TAM receptors regulate cancer metastasis via natural killer cells, Nature, vol. 507:508-512, 2014. LDC1267 is a highly selective TAM kinase inhibitor with IC50 of <5 nM, 8 nM, and 29 nM for MerTK, Tyro3, and Axl, respectively, and has the chemical structure: Bernsmeier, et al., have noted that characteristics of decompensated cirrhosis and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) include susceptibility to infection, immune paresis and monocyte dysfunction. The authors found that the number of monocytes and macrophages that expressed MerTK was greatly increased in circulation, livers and lymph nodes of patients with ACLF. They found that addition of a substituted pyrazolopyrimidine UNC569 (see WO 2011/146313 filed by Wang, et al., and assigned to University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, page 25) restored production of inflammatory cytokines.

It is an object of the invention to identify new methods and compositions for the treatment of infectious diseases. It is another object of the invention to identify new methods and compositions for the treatment of thrombosis. It is another object of the invention to identify new methods and compositions for the treatment of a tumor, cancer or other neoplasm. It is yet another object of the invention to identify new methods and compositions for the treatment of disorders that can be treated with immunosuppression, or which would benefit from immunostimulatory therapy. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to the use of selected pyrimidine compounds having Mer tyrosine kinase (MerTK) inhibitory activity as anti-infective agents, immunostimulatory agents, anti-cancer agents (including against MerTK -/- tumors and ITD and TKD mutant forms of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)), and as adjunctive agents in combination with chemotherapeutic, radiation or other standard of care for neoplasms. An effective amount of the pyrimidinyl compounds described in Formulas I, II, III and IV below or other active compounds as otherwise provided herein can be used to treat a host bearing any virus-related infection where the virus has a virion envelope phosphatidyl serine that complexes with MerTK to achieve viral entry or is otherwise facilitated by MerTK in the infectious process. Nonlimiting examples of such viruses include, but are not limited to, Flaviviridae viruses, including Flavivirus (such as Yellow Fever, West Nile and Dengue), Hepacivirus (Hepatitis C virus, "HCV"), Pegivirus and Pestivirus (Bovine viral diarrhea virus); Filoviridae viruses, including Ebola viruses; Togaviridae viruses, including Chikungunya virus; Coronaviruses, such as SARS (Severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome); Orthomyxoviridae viruses, for example influenza; Paramyxoviridae viruses, for example Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), measles and mumps; and Caliciviridae viruses, including Lagovirus, Vesivirus, and Sapovirus and Norovirus (Norwalk-like virus), and Lentiviruses, for example, HIV. In one embodiment, the virus is an enveloped virus. In another embodiment, the virus is a non-enveloped virus. It has also been discovered that an effective amount of the pyrimidinyl compounds described in Formulas I, II, III and IV below can be used to treat a host bearing a bacterial infection. In one embodiment, the bacteria treated is, for example, a Gram-negative bacilli (GNB), especially Escherichia coli, Gram-positive cocci (GPC), Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae. In one embodiment, the bacterial infection is associated with liver failure. In one embodiment, an active compound disclosed herein is administered in combination with an antibiotic or another anti-bacterial agent. It has also been discovered that the compounds described herein can be used as immunomodulatory agents that reverse the MerTK-induced suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as wound healing cytokines (IL-10 and GAS6) and enhance the expression of acute inflammatory cytokines (IL-12 and IL-6). In this way, the pyrimidine compounds can "re-normalize" or "re-program" the host microenvironment in the diseased tissue area to attack the diseased cells.

As part of the invention, one or more of the compounds disclosed herein can be used as adjunctive antineoplastic therapy for its immunostimulatory effect as a means to increase the efficacy of the antineoplastic standard of care therapies, such as chemotherapeutic compounds or radiation. Some of these pyrimidine compounds have dual Mer/Flt-3 inhibitory activity, as discussed in more detail below, and thus are useful in the treatment of tumors mediated by FLT-3 or which exhibit drug resistance or ITD and TKD mutations, such as certain forms of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)) A portion of the compounds described as useful in the present inventions were first described in WO 2013/177168 and WO 2014/085225, both of which are incorporated by reference for all purposes.

Isotopic substitution In one embodiment, the present invention includes compounds of Formula I, II, II, or IV and additional active compounds described herein, and the use of these compounds with at least one desired isotopic substitution of an atom, at an amount above the natural abundance of the isotope, i.e., enriched. Isotopes are atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers, i.e., the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine, and chlorine, such as 2H, 3H, nC, 13C, 14C, 15N, 18F 31P, 32P, 35S, 36CI, 125I respectively. The invention includes various isotopically labeled compounds as defined herein, for example those into which radioactive isotopes, such as 3H, 13C, and 14C, are present. Such isotopically labelled compounds are useful in metabolic studies (with 1 C), reaction kinetic studies (with, for example H or H), detection or imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) including drug or substrate tissue distribution assays, or in radioactive treatment of patients. In particular, an 18F labeled compound may be particularly desirable for PET or SPECT studies. Isotopically labeled compounds of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the schemes or in the examples and preparations described below by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent. By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen, for example, deuterium (2H) and tritium (3H) may be used anywhere in described structures. Alternatively or in addition, isotopes of carbon, e.g., 13C and 1 C, may be used. A typical isotopic substitution is deuterium for hydrogen at one or more locations on the molecule to improve the performance of the drug, for example, the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, half-life, stability, AUC, Tmax, Cmax, etc. For example, the deuterium can be bound to carbon in a location of bond breakage during metabolism (an a-deuterium kinetic isotope effect) or next to or near the site of bond breakage (a β-deuterium kinetic isotope effect). Isotopic substitutions, for example deuterium substitutions, can be partial or complete. Partial deuterium substitution means that at least one hydrogen is substituted with deuterium. In certain embodiments, the isotope is 90, 95 or 99% or more enriched in an isotope at any location of interest. In one embodiments deuterium is 90, 95 or 99% enriched at a desired location. Unless otherwise stated, the enrichment at any point is above natural abundance and enough to alter a detectable property of the drug in a human. In one embodiment, the substitution of a hydrogen atom for a deuterium atom occurs within an R group when at least one of the variables within the R group is hydrogen (e.g., 2H or D) or alkyl (e.g., CD3). For example, when any of R groups are, or contain for example through substitution, methyl or ethyl, the alkyl residue is typically deuterated, e.g., CD3j CH2CD3 or CD2CD3. In certain other embodiments, when any of the above mentioned R groups are hydrogen, the hydrogen may be isotopically enriched as deuterium (i.e., 2H). A dash ("-") that is not between two letters or symbols is used to indicate a point of attachment for a substituent. For example, -(C=0)NH2 is attached through carbon of the keto (C=0) group.

The active compounds disclosed herein can, as noted above, be provided in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are salts that retain the desired biological activity of the parent compound and do not impart undesired toxicological effects. Nonlimiting examples of such salts are (a) acid addition salts formed with inorganic acids, for example hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid and the like; and salts formed with organic acids such as, for example, acetic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, gluconic acid, citric acid, malic acid, ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, tannic acid, palmitic acid, alginic acid, polyglutamic acid, naphthalenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, p- toluenesulfonic acid, naphthalenedisulfonic acid, polygalacturonic acid, and the like; (b) salts formed from elemental anions such as chlorine, bromine, and iodine, and (c) salts derived from bases, such as ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such as those of sodium and potassium, alkaline earth metal salts such as those of calcium and magnesium, and salts with organic bases such as dicyclohexylamine and N-methyl-D-glucamine. Active compounds as described herein can be prepared in accordance with known procedures, or variations thereof that will be apparent to those skilled in the art. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS AND DOSAGES FOR ALL INDICATIONS The active compounds described above may be formulated for administration in a pharmaceutical carrier in accordance with known techniques. See, e.g., Remington, The Science And Practice of Pharmacy (9th Ed. 1995). In the manufacture of a pharmaceutical formulation according to the invention, the active compound (including the physiologically acceptable salts thereof) is typically admixed with, inter alia, an acceptable carrier. The carrier must, of course, be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with any other ingredients in the formulation and must not be deleterious to the patient. The carrier may be a solid or a liquid, or both, and is preferably formulated with the compound as a unit-dose formulation, for example, a tablet, which may contain from 0.01 or 0.5% to 95% or 99% by weight of the active compound. One or more active compounds may be incorporated in the formulations of the invention, which may be prepared by any of the well-known techniques of pharmacy comprising admixing the components, optionally including one or more accessory ingredients. In one aspect, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically effective amount of an active compound as described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compounds provided herein are administered for medical therapy in a therapeutically effective amount. The amount of the compounds administered will typically be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the compound administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like. The formulations of the invention include those suitable for oral, rectal, topical, buccal (e.g., sub-lingual), vaginal, parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal, or intravenous), topical (i.e., both skin and mucosal surfaces, including airway surfaces), transdermal administration, and intraventricular injection (injection into a ventricle of the brain, e.g., by an implanted catheter or omman reservoir, such as in the case of morbid obesity), ocular (via injection, implantation or by reservoir), and intranasal, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the condition being treated and on the nature of the particular active compound which is being used. The compositions for oral administration can take the form of bulk liquid solutions or suspensions, or bulk powders. Typically, the compositions are presented in unit dosage forms to facilitate accurate dosing. The term "unit dosage forms" refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient. Typical unit dosage forms include prefilled, premeasured ampules or syringes of the liquid compositions or pills, tablets, capsules or the like in the case of solid compositions. In such compositions, the compound is usually a minor component (as a nonlimiting example, from about 0.1 to about 50% by weight or preferably from about 1 to about 40% by weight) with the remainder being various vehicles or carriers and processing aids helpful for forming the desired dosing form. In one embodiment, the compound is present from about 1% to about 10% by weight. Liquid forms suitable for oral administration may include a suitable aqueous or nonaqueous vehicle with buffers, suspending and dispensing agents, colorants, flavors and the like. Solid forms may include, for example, any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring. Formulations suitable for oral administration may be presented in discrete units, such as capsules, cachets, lozenges, or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of the active compound; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion. Such formulations may be prepared by any suitable method of pharmacy which includes the step of bringing into association the active compound and a suitable carrier (which may contain one or more accessory ingredients as noted above). In general, the formulations of the invention are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active compound with a liquid or finely divided solid carrier, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the resulting mixture. For example, a tablet may be prepared by compressing or molding a powder or granules containing the active compound, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing, in a suitable machine, the compound in a free-flowing form, such as a powder or granules optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, and/or surface active/dispersing agent(s). Molded tablets may be made by molding, in a suitable machine, the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid binder. In one embodiment, the compounds are administered in a controlled release formulation. Formulations suitable for buccal (sub-lingual) administration include lozenges comprising the active compound in a flavored base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; and pastilles comprising the compound in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia. Formulations of the present invention suitable for parenteral administration comprise sterile aqueous and non-aqueous injection solutions of the active compound, which preparations are preferably isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. These preparations may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. Aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit\dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, saline or water-for-injection immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. For example, in one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an injectable, stable, sterile composition comprising a compound of Formula (I), or a salt thereof, in a unit dosage form in a sealed container. The compound or salt is provided in the form of a lyophilizate which is capable of being reconstituted with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to form a liquid composition suitable for injection thereof into a subject. The unit dosage form typically comprises from about 10 mg to about 10 grams of the compound or salt. When the compound or salt is substantially water-insoluble, a sufficient amount of emulsifying agent which is physiologically acceptable may be employed in sufficient quantity to emulsify the compound or salt in an aqueous carrier. One such useful emulsifying agent is phosphatidyl choline. Injectable compositions are typically based upon injectable sterile saline or phosphate-buffered saline or other injectable carriers known in the art. Formulations suitable for rectal administration are preferably presented as unit dose suppositories. These may be prepared by admixing the active compound with one or more conventional solid carriers, for example, cocoa butter, and then shaping the resulting mixture. Formulations suitable for topical application to the skin preferably take the form of an ointment, cream, lotion, paste, gel, spray, aerosol, or oil. Carriers which may be used include petroleum jelly, lanoline, polyethylene glycols, alcohols, transdermal enhancers, and combinations of two or more thereof. Formulations suitable for transdermal administration may be presented as discrete patches adapted to remain in intimate contact with the epidermis of the recipient for a prolonged period of time. Formulations suitable for transdermal administration may also be delivered by iontophoresis (see, for example, Pharmaceutical Research 3 (6):318 (1986)) and typically take the form of an optionally buffered aqueous solution of the active compound. Suitable formulations comprise citrate or bis\tris buffer (pH 6) or ethanol/water and contain from 0.1 to 0.2 active ingredient. Further, the present invention provides liposomal formulations of the compounds disclosed herein and salts thereof. The technology for forming liposomal suspensions is well known in the art. When the compound or salt thereof is an aqueous-soluble salt, using conventional liposome technology, the same may be incorporated into lipid vesicles. In such an instance, due to the water solubility of the compound or salt, the compound or salt will be substantially entrained within the hydrophilic center or core of the liposomes. The lipid layer employed may be of any conventional composition and may either contain cholesterol or may be cholesterol-free. When the compound or salt of interest is water-insoluble, again employing conventional liposome formation technology, the salt may be substantially entrained within the hydrophobic lipid bilayer which forms the structure of the liposome. In either instance, the liposomes which are produced may be reduced in size, as through the use of standard sonication and homogenization techniques. Of course, the liposomal formulations containing the compounds disclosed herein or salts thereof, may be lyophilized to produce a lyophilizate which may be reconstituted with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as water, to regenerate a liposomal suspension. Other pharmaceutical compositions may be prepared from the water-insoluble compounds disclosed herein, or salts thereof, such as aqueous base emulsions. In such an instance, the composition will contain a sufficient amount of pharmaceutically acceptable emulsifying agent to emulsify the desired amount of the compound or salt thereof. Particularly useful emulsifying agents include phosphatidyl cholines, and lecithin. In addition to compounds of Formula I, II, III, or IV, or other active compounds described herein, or their salts, the pharmaceutical compositions may contain other additives, such as pH-adjusting additives. In particular, useful pH-adjusting agents include acids, such as hydrochloric acid, bases or buffers, such as sodium lactate, sodium acetate, sodium phosphate, sodium citrate, sodium borate, or sodium gluconate. Further, the compositions may contain microbial preservatives. Useful microbial preservatives include methylparaben, propylparaben, and benzyl alcohol. The microbial preservative is typically employed when the formulation is placed in a vial designed for multidose use. Of course, as indicated, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be lyophilized using techniques well known in the art. The Mer TKI compound of this invention can also be administered in sustained release forms or from sustained release drug delivery systems. A description of representative sustained release materials can be found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences. In certain embodiments, the formulation comprises water. In another embodiment, the formulation comprises a cyclodextrin derivative. In certain embodiments, the formulation comprises hexapropyl-P-cyclodextrin. In a more particular embodiment, the formulation comprises (10-50% in water). The present invention also includes pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of compounds of the compounds of the invention. The acids which are used to prepare the pharmaceutically acceptable salts are those which form non-toxic acid addition salts, i.e. salts containing pharmacologically acceptable anions such as the hydrochloride, hydroiodide, hydrobromide, nitrate, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, acetate, lactate, citrate, tartrate, succinate, maleate, fumarate, benzoate, para-toluenesulfonate, and the like. The above-described components for pharmaceutical compositions are merely representative. Other materials as well as processing techniques and the like are set forth in Part 8 of Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th edition, 1985, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pennsylvania, which is incorporated herein by reference. As noted above, the present invention provides pharmaceutical formulations comprising the active compounds (including the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof), in pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for oral, rectal, topical, buccal, parenteral, intramuscular, intradermal, or intravenous, and transdermal administration. The therapeutically effective dosage of any specific compound, the use of which is in the scope of present invention, will vary somewhat from compound to compound, and patient to patient, and will depend upon the condition of the patient and the route of delivery. As a general proposition, a dosage from about 0.1 to about 50 mg/kg will have therapeutic efficacy, with all weights being calculated based upon the weight of the active compound, including the cases where a salt is employed. Toxicity concerns at the higher level may restrict intravenous dosages to a lower level such as up to about 10 mg/kg, with all weights being calculated based upon the weight of the active base, including the cases where a salt is employed. The duration of the treatment can be once per day for a period of two to three weeks or until the condition is essentially controlled. The therapeutically effective dosage of any active compound described herein will be determined by the health care practitioner depending on the condition, size and age of the patient as well as the route of delivery. In one non-limited embodiment, a dosage from about 0.1 to about 200 mg/kg has therapeutic efficacy, with all weights being calculated based upon the weight of the active compound, including the cases where a salt is employed. In some embodiments, the dosage can be the amount of compound needed to provide a serum concentration of the active compound of up to between about 1 and 5, 10, 20, 30, or 40 μΜ. In some embodiments, a dosage from about 10 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg can be employed for oral administration. Typically, a dosage from about 0.5 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg can be employed for intramuscular injection. In some embodiments, dosages can be from about 1 μπιοΐ/kg to about 50 μηιοΐ/kg, or, optionally, between about 22 μιηοΐ kg and about 33 μΓηοΙ/kg of the compound for intravenous or oral administration. An oral dosage form can include any appropriate amount of active material, including for example from 5 mg to, 50, 100, 200, or 500 mg per tablet or other solid dosage form. Active compounds may be administered as pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs, which are those prodrugs of the active compounds of the present invention which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like, commensurate with a reasonable risk/benefit ratio, and effective for their intended use, as well as the zwitterionic forms, where possible, of the compounds of the invention. The term "prodrug" refers to compounds that are transformed, sometimes rapidly in vivo to yield the parent compound of the above formulae, for example, by hydrolysis in blood. A thorough discussion is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, Prodrugs as Novel delivery Systems, Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series and in Edward B. Roche, ed., Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are incorporated by reference herein. See also US Patent No. 6,680,299 Examples include a prodrug that is metabolized in vivo by a subject to an active drug having an activity of active compounds as described herein, wherein the prodrug is an ester of an alcohol or carboxylic acid group, if such a group is present in the compound; an acetal or ketal of an alcohol group, if such a group is present in the compound; an N-Mannich base or an imine of an amine group, if such a group is present in the compound; or a Schiff base, oxime, acetal, enol ester, oxazolidine, or thiazolidine of a carbonyl group, if such a group is present in the compound, such as described in US Patent No. 6,680,324 and US Patent No. 6,680,322.

IMMUNOMODULATORY AND IMMUNOSTIMULATORY AGENTS It has also been discovered that the compounds described herein can be used as immunomodulatory agents that reverse the MerTK-induced suppression of proinflammatory cytokines such as wound healing cytokines (IL-10 and GAS6) and enhance the expression of acute inflammatory cytokines (IL-12 and IL-6). In this way, the pyrimidine compounds can "re-normalize" or "re-program" the host microenvironment in the diseased tissue area to attack the diseased cells. This immunostimulatory activity can be used therapeutically to treat a host with a tumor, cancer or other neoplasm, or alternatively, to treat a host with an infection, for example, a viral or bacterial infection. Taking advantage of the immunostimulatory activity of the compounds described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition, salt, isotopic analog, or prodrug thereof, may be used for the treatment of a MERTK-negative (-/-) tumor or cancer. In one embodiment, the cancer is a MERTK-negative (-/-) breast cancer. Therefore, as part of the invention, one or more of the compounds disclosed herein can be used as adjunctive therapy for its immunostimulatory effect as a means to increase the efficacy of the antineoplastic standard of care therapies, such as chemotherapeutic compounds or radiation. In another aspect of the invention, one or more of the compounds disclosed herein can be used as adjunctive therapy for its immunostimulatory effect as a means to increase the efficacy of the antiviral or antibacterial standard of care therapies. For example, a compound of Formula I, II, III, or IV, or another compound as described herein, is administered to a host in an immunomodulatory effective amount to inhibit Mer tyrosine kinase activity in the host's tumor associated macrophage to suppress tumor immunity. In one embodiment, the dosage of the Mer TKI administered as an immunomodulatory agent to stimulate innate anti-tumor immunity is lower than a dosage of a Mer TKI administered to a host as a direct anti-cancer agent. In one embodiment, the Mer TKI is administered at a dosage which exhibits immunomodulatory but not direct cytotoxic effect. In one embodiment, the cancer is a MERTK-negative (-/-) cancer. In one embodiment, the MerTK inhibitory compound administered is selected from UNC3121A, U C3194A, UNC2490A, UNC4171A, UNC4198A, UNC4337A, and UNC4340A. Without wanting to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the administration of a chemotherapeutic agent results in the apoptosis of tumor cells, exposing antigenic tumor proteins. The host's innate immune system is thus stimulated to recognize the antigenic apoptotic components from the tumor cells after chemotherapy or ionizing radiation and mount an immune response. In one embodiment, the administration of a chemotherapeutic agent or ionizing radiation, before, with or subsequently followed by the administration of a Mer TKI is carried out using the normal standard of care chemotherapeutic protocol. In another embodiment, the standard of care protocol of the chemotherapeutic is changed in a manner that causes less toxicity to the host due to the adjunctive or synergistic activity of the Mer TKI. In one embodiment, a method for the treatment of a tumor is provided that includes administering an effective amount of a Mer TKI to inhibit TK signaling in a tumor associated macrophage, without inhibiting the survival signal in the tumor itself. In this way, the Mer TKI can be used to ramp up the immune response to the tumor by inhibiting macrophage tumorogenic tolerance during normal tumor chemotherapeutic agent. The immunomodulatory dosage of the Mer TKI can be given prior to, with or after chemotherapeutic therapy and can be used simultaneously with or intermittently with the chemotherapeutic therapy. In one embodiment, less chemotherapeutic therapy is needed than the normal standard of care defined for that chemotherapeutic agent, due to the increased efficacy of the immune response in the surrounding tumor microenvironment. In one embodiment, a dose of Mer TKI including active compounds of the present invention (for example 0.5 to 150 mg/dose) is given as a type of adjunctive therapy with the chemotherapeutic agent. In one aspect of the invention, a Mer TKI is administered to a host having a cancer as an immunomodulatory agent to inhibit Mer tyrosine kinase activity in a tumor associated macrophage in order to suppress tumor immunity. In one embodiment, the dosage of the Mer TKI administered as an immunomodulatory agent to stimulate innate anti-tumor immunity is lower than a dosage of a Mer TKI administered to a host as a direct anti-cancer agent. In one embodiment, the Mer TKI is administered at a dosage which exhibits immunomodulatory but not direct cytotoxic effects on the cancer. In one embodiment, the dose associated with the immunomodulatory effect of an active compound of the present invention is about 2-fold, about 3 -fold, about 4-fold, about 5- fold, about 6-fold, about 7-fold, about 8-fold, about 9-fold, about 10-fold or greater lower than the dose associated with a direct survival-signal inhibiting anti-tumor or cytotoxic effect, or the direct antiviral or antibacterial effect. In one embodiment, the dose used to induce an immunomodulatory effect in a host is between about .5 mg and about 150 mg. In one embodiment, the dose is about 1 mg, about 2 mg, about 3 mg, about 4 mg, about 5mg, about 10 mg, about 12 mg, about 15 mg, about 20 mg, about 25 mg, about 30 mg, about 35 mg, about 40 mg, about 45 mg, about 50 mg, about 55 mg, about 60 mg, about 65 mg, about 70 mg, about 75 mg, about 80 mg, about 85 mg, about 90 mg, about 95 mg, about 100 mg, about 110 mg, about 125 mg, about 140 mg, or about 150 mg. 6.

Immunomodulatory Combination Agents. Active compounds as described herein used in a dosage for direct effect on the diseased cell can be used in combination with one or more immunotherapy agents for additive or synergistic efficacy against solid tumors. In one embodiment, a tumor associated macrophage MerTK inhibiting amount of a Mer TKI is used in combination or alternation with the immunomodulatory agent. In another embodiment, a host tumor survival-signal inhibiting, antiviral or antibacterial amount of a Mer TKI is used in combination or alternation with the immunomodulatory agent. Immunomodulators are small molecules or biologic agents that treat a disease by inducing, enhancing or suppressing the host's immune system. In the present application, one or more immunomodulators are selected that induce or enhance the host's immune system. Some immunomodulators boost the host's immune system and others help train the host's immune system to better attack tumor cells. Other immunomodulators target proteins that help cancer grow. Three general categories of immunotherapies are antibodies, cancer vaccines, and non-specific immunotherapies. Antibodies are typically administered as monoclonals, although that is not required. "Naked monoclonal antibodies" work by attaching to antigens on tumor cells. Some antibodies can act as a marker for the body's immune system to destroy the tumor cells. Others block signaling agents for tumor cells. Antibodies can generally be used to bind to any signaling or metabolic agent that directly or indirectly facilitates tumor growth. Examples are alemtuzumab (Campath) which binds to CD52 antigen, and trastuzumab (Herceptin), which binds to the HER2 protein. In another embodiment, an antibody can be used that is conjugated to another moiety that increases it delivery or efficacy. For example, the antibody can be connected to a cytotoxic drug or a radiolabel. Conjugated antibodies are sometimes referred to as "tagged, labeled or loaded". Radiolabeled antibodies have small radioactive particles attached to them. Examples are Zevalin, which is an antibody against CD20 used to treat lymphoma. Chemolabeled antibodies are antibodies that have cytotoxic agents attached to them. Examples are Adcetris, which targets CD30, and Kadcyla, which targets HER2. Ontak, while not an antibody, is similar in that it is interleukin-2 attached to a toxin from diphtheria. Another category of immunotherapy that can be used in the present invention is a cancer vaccine. Most cancer vaccines are prepared from tumor cells, parts of tumor cells or pure antigens. The vaccine can be used with an adjuvant to help boost the immune response. An example is Provenge, which is the first cancer vaccine approved by the US FDA. The vaccine can for example be a dendritic cell vaccine or a vector-based vaccine Nonspecific tumor immunotherapies and adjuvants include compounds that stimulate the immune system to do a better job at attacking the tumor cells. Such immunotherapies include cytokines, interleukins, interferons (a primarily but can be also β or γ). Specific agents include granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-12, IL-7, IL-21, drags that target CTLA-4 (such as Yervoy, which is Ipilimumab) and drugs that target PD-1 or PDL-1 (such as for example, nivolumab (BMS), pembrolizumab (Merck), pidilizumab (CureTech/Teva), AMP-244 (Amplimmune/GSK), BMS-936559 (BMS), and MEDI4736 (Roche/Genentech)). Other drugs that boost the immune system are thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide, the Bacille Calmette-Gurin bacteria and Imiquimod. Additional therapeutic agents that can be used in combination with the MerTK inhibitor include bispecific antibodies, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. In one aspect of the present invention, a compound described herein can be combined with at least one immunosuppressive agent. The immunosuppressive agent is preferably selected from the group consisting of a calcineurin inhibitor, e.g. a cyclosporin or an ascomycin, e.g. Cyclosporin A (NEORAL®), FK506 (tacrolimus), pimecrolimus, a mTOR inhibitor, e.g. rapamycin or a derivative thereof, e.g. Sirolimus (RAPAMU E®), Everolimus (Certican®), temsirolimus, zotarolimus, biolimus-7, biolimus-9, a rapalog, e.g.ridaforolimus, azathioprine, campath 1H, a SIP receptor modulator, e.g. fingolimod or an analogue thereof, an anti IL-8 antibody, mycophenolic acid or a salt thereof, e.g. sodium salt, or a prodrug thereof, e.g. Mycophenolate Mofetil (CELLCEPT®), O T3 (ORTHOCLONE O T3®), Prednisone, ATGAM®, THYMOGLOBULIN®, Brequinar Sodium, OKT4, T10B9.A-3A, 33B3.1, 15-deoxyspergualin, tresperimus, Leflunomide ARAVA®, CTLAI-Ig, anti-CD25, anti-IL2R, Basilixi ab (SIMULECT®), Daclizumab (ZENAPAX®), mizorbine, methotrexate, dexamethasone, ISAtx-247, SDZ ASM 981 (pimecrolimus, Elidel®), CTLA41g (Abatacept), belatacept, LFA31g, etanercept (sold as Enbrel® by Imrnunex), adalimumab (Humira®), infliximab (Remicade®), an anti-LFA-1 antibody, natalizumab (Antegren®), Enlimomab, gavilimomab, antithymocyte immunoglobulin, siplizumab, Alefacept efalizumab, pentasa, mesalazine, asacol, codeine phosphate, benorylate, fenbufen, naprosyn, diclofenac, etodolac and indomethacin, aspirin and ibuprofen. 7. ANTI-PLATELET AGENTS In another embodiment, a compound described herein is used in the treatment of blot clot (thrombus) formation in a host in need thereof. In one embodiment, the host is suffering from coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, or cerebrovascular disease. In one embodiment, a compound described herein is administered to a host prior to any medical or surgical procedure in which diminished coagulation potential is desirable. In one embodiment, an active compound disclosed herein is administered in combination with another anti-thrombotic or anti-clotting agent. In one embodiment, a compound of Formula I, II, III, or IV, or another compound, as described herein, is provided for use in treating blot clot (thrombus) formation in a subject in need thereof, comprising administering an active compound as described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition, salt, isotopic analog, or prodrug thereof. In one embodiment, the compound for use in treating blot clot (thrombus) formation in a subject in need thereof is selected from UNC3121A, U C3194A, UNC2490A, U C4171A, UNC4198A, U C4337A, and UNC4340A, including a pharmaceutically acceptable composition, salt, isotopic analog or prodrug thereof. In one embodiment, the treatment of blood clot formation is in, for example, a subject with coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, or cerebrovascular disease, or the treatment is given prior to any medical or surgical procedure in which diminished coagulation potential is desirable. Coronary artery disease includes, for example, any coronary dysfunction (pathological state) resulting from coronary artherosclerosis, i.e. partial or total occlusion of coronary vessels. The term also includes a range of various acute and chronical pathological states comprising stable and unstable angina pectoris (SAP and UAP, respectively), left ventricular dysfunction LVD, (congestive) heart failure CHF, myocardial death. Peripheral vascular disease includes, for example, occlusive or functional peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Examples of occlusive PAD include peripheral arterial occlusion, which may be acute, and Buerger's disease (thomboangiitis obliterans). Examples of functional PAD include Raynaud's disease, Raynaud's phenomenon, and acrocyanosis. Cerebrovascular disease includes, for example, any abnormality of the brain resulting from a pathologic process of a blood vessel. In one embodiment, the cerebrovascular disease is selected from cerebral ischemia, cerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, or ischemic reperfusion injury resulting from reintroduction of blood flow following cerebral ischemia or ischemic stroke. In one non-limiting embodiment, the medical or surgical procedure is pulmonary vein ablation. In one embodiment, the treatment of blood clot formation is in a host having thrombi in blood vessels from pathologies or treatments including, for example, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, atrial fibrillation, stroke, renal damage, percutaneous translumenal coronary angioplasty, athreosclerosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, sepsis, endotoxemia (i.e., the presence of endotoxins in the blood), pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis.

In one embodiment, a host is administered an effective amount of a compound described herein due to the formation of clots resulting from some pathological conditions (for example, genetic mutation of VWF cleaving protease, ADAMT13), which may cause spontaneous binding of VWF to platelets resulting in formation of microthrombi in blood vessels leading to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and other microangiopathy. Microangiopathy is a disease of blood vessels in which the walls of very small blood vessels (capillaries) become so thick and weak that they bleed, leak protein, and slow the flow of blood. In one embodiment, the treatment is in a patient with hemolytic uremic syndrome. In one embodiment, an active compound disclosed herein is administered in combination with an additional anti-platelet agent.

NANOPARTICLE COMPOSITIONS OR CARRIERS In one aspect of the present invention, an effective amount of an active compound as described herein is incorporated into nanoparticles, e.g. for convenience of delivery and/or extended release delivery. The use of materials in nanoscale provides one the ability to modify fundamental physical properties such as solubility, diffusivity, blood circulation half- life, drug release characteristics, and immunogenicity. In the last two decades, a number of nanoparticle-based therapeutic and diagnostic agents have been developed for the treatment of cancer, diabetes, pain, asthma, allergy, and infections. These nanoscale agents can provide more effective and/or more convenient routes of administration, lower therapeutic toxicity, extend the product life cycle, and ultimately reduce health-care costs. As therapeutic delivery systems, nanoparticles allow targeted delivery and controlled release. In addition, nanoparticle-based drug delivery can be used to release drugs at a sustained rate and thus lower the frequency of administration, deliver drugs in a target manner to minimize systemic side effects, or deliver two or more drugs simultaneously for combination therapy to generate a synergistic effect and suppress drug resistance. To date, a number of nanotechnology-based therapeutic products have been approved for clinical use. Among these products, liposomal drugs and polymer-based conjugates account for more than 80% of the products. See, Zhang, L., et al., Nanoparticles in Medicine: Therapeutic Applications and Developments, Clin. Pharm. and Ther., 83(5):761-769, 2008. Optimal solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) can be produced in a controlled fashion when a fraction of lipid in the crystalline alpha form can be created and preserved. By doing this, the SLN carrier has a built in trigger mechanism as lipids transform from the alpha to beta form and consequently control drug release. Drug release profiles can be modified according to the composition of the lipid matrix, surfactant concentration and production parameters. See, Muller, R.H., et al., Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) for controlled drug delivery - a review of the state of the art, Eur. H. Pharm. Biopharm., 50:161-177, 2000. Consien et al. have recently disclosed lipid nanoparticles having novel amino-lipids that form lipid nanoparticles and their use for the intracellular delivery of biologically active compounds, e.g., nucleic acids. See, US 8,691,750 to Consien et al. In regard to controlled release, Kanwar has recently disclosed alginate adsorbed chitosan adsorbed lactoferrin adsorbed calcium phosphate nanoparticles and the controlled release of lactoferrin from the nanoparticles. See, WO 2012/145801 to Kanwar. In addition, Armes et al. have recently disclosed polymer-templated core-shell nanoparticles adapted to facilitate controlled release of at least one active agent into a system in response to controlled changes in the pH of the system. See, US 8,580,311 to Armes, S. et al. incorporated by reference herein. Petros and DeSimone have recently reviewed strategies in the design of nanoparticles. In addition, the authors reviewed their PRINT (particle replication in non-wetting templates) technology for generating microparticles and nanoparticles. See, Petros, R. A. and DeSimone, J.M., Strategies in the design of nanoparticles for therapeutic applications, Nature Reviews/Drug Discovery, vol. 9:615-627, 2010. Importantly, the authors disclosed the production of nanoparticles in which a single parameter (shape or size) can be altered independently of all other particle attributes. The authors concluded their paper by outlining several particle characteristics that have emerged as being central to the function of engineered nanoparticles. These parameters include particle size, particle shape, surface characteristics and the ability to release therapeutics. Additional nanoparticle fabrication methods can also be found in US 8,465,775, US 8,444,899, US 8,420,124, US 8,263,129, US 8,158,728 and 8,268,446 all hereby incorporated by reference. Nanoparticles may be prepared using a wide variety of methods known in the art. For example, nanoparticles can be formed by methods as nanoprecipitation, flow focusing fluidic channels, spray drying, single and double emulsion solvent evaporation, solvent extraction, phase separation, milling, microemulsion procedures, microfabrication, nanofabrication, sacrificial layers, simple and complex coacervation, and other methods well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Alternatively or additionally, aqueous and organic solvent syntheses for monodisperse semiconductor, conductive, magnetic, organic, and other nanomaterials have been described (Pellegrino et al., 2005, Small, 1:48; Murray et al., 2000, Ann. Rev. Mat. Sci., 30:545; and Trindade et al., 2001, Chem. Mat., 13:3843). Additional methods have been described in the literature (see, e.g., Doubrow, Ed., "Microcapsules and Nanoparticles in Medicine and Pharmacy," CRC Press, Boca Raton, 1992; Mathiowitz et al., 1987, J.

Those skilled in the art will recognize that the polymers listed herein represent an exemplary, not comprehensive, list of polymers that can be of use in accordance with the present invention. The compounds of the present invention can be coupled to a nanoparticle by any of a number of methods. Generally, the coupling can be a result of bonding between the compound and the nanoparticle.

In some embodiments, however, the compounds are encapsulated by the nanoparticle as a result of the structure of the nanoparticle rather than bonding to the nanoparticle. In some embodiments, the nanoparticle comprises a polymer as provided herein, and the compounds described herein are coupled to the nanoparticle.

EFFICACY OF A NOVEL SMALL MOLECULE MERTK RECEPTOR TYROSINE KINASE INHIBITOR IN B-RAF WILD-TYPE AND B-RAF MUTANT MELANOMA CELL. A MERTK-selective small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is evaluated in preclinical models of melanoma, both alone and in combination with vemurafenib (a mutant B-RAF TKI). B-RAF wild-type (HMCB) and B-RAF mutant (G361) cell lines are treated with Mer TKI or vehicle. Downstream signaling is evaluated by immunoblotting, and induction of apoptosis is determined by flow cytometry in cells stained with YO-PRO®-l iodide and propidium iodide. Alternatively, cells are seeded in media containing Mer TKI or vehicle and colony formation is determined. EXAMPLE 26. INHIBITION OF MURINE MELANOMA GROWTH BY A SMALL MOLECULE MER TYROSINE KINASE INHIBITOR (MER TKI). In this example, the activity of a MerTK inhibitor is examined on tumor growth in autochthonous murine tumor models. Mer TKI is assessed in immune-competent, genetically engineered murine models (GEMMs). Activity is tested in RAS -driven, iNK4a/Arf null melanoma GEMM (TRIA) mice. The efficacy of 15 chemotherapeutic and/or targeted regimens in a large (>220) cohort of TRIA mice has previously been tested (Clinical Cancer Research 18:5290, 2012). The overall response is 10% (partial responses and stable disease). There are no complete responses. A combination of MEK (AZD 6244) and PI3K/mTOR (BEZ235) inhibitors are the most active previous regimen (responses seen in 9/18 mice = 50%, with 0 CRs) with moderate toxicity. EXAMPLE 27. CELL KILLING BY MER TKIS IN COMBINATION WITH FGFR INHIBITION. In this study, the interaction between a novel MerTK-selective small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and AZD-4547, an FGFR TKI, in NSCLC cell lines is studied. Colo699 (MerTK+, FGFR+) and H226 (MerTK+, FGFR+) NSCLC cells are cultured for 14 days in soft agar in the presence of Mer TKI and/or AZD-4547, alone or in combination, and colonies are stained and counted. Changes in the activity of downstream signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT, MEK ERK, and STAT proteins are evaluated by immunoblotting. EXAMPLE 28. INHIBITION OF MER TYROSINE KINASE WITH A NOVEL SMALL MOLECULE INHIBITOR IN MOUSE MODELS OF ALL. In this example, preclinical testing of Mer TKIs as a potential therapy for MERTK- expressing ALL is disclosed. Mer TKI inhibition of phosphorylation/activation of MerTK is tested in 697 B-ALL cells. Mer TKIs are tested in several mouse models, including an orthotopic B-ALL xenograft model of minimal residual disease and a similar model of existent disease in which leukemia is established for 14 days prior to initiation of treatment. In both models, tumor burden is measured by bioluminescent imaging. EXAMPLE 29. INHIBITION OF MER TYROSINE KINASE WITH A NOVEL SMALL MOLECULE INHIBITOR IN PRE-CLINICAL MODELS OF NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER. The effects of Mer TKI treatment on activation of MerTK and related members of the TAM-family of kinases, Axl and Tyro3, and effects on downstream proliferative and pro- survival signaling pathways are analyzed by immunoblot. In addition, Mer TKI-mediated anti-tumor activity is determined in a panel of NSCLC cell lines using soft-agar and clonogenic assays. Cells are stained with YoPro-1 -iodide and propidium iodide dyes and induction of apoptosis is determined using flow cytometry. Finally, a subcutaneous murine xenograft model is employed to determine therapeutic effects in vivo. EXAMPLE 30. A DUAL FLT-3 AND MER TYROSINE KINASE SMALL MOLECULE INHIBITOR IN ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA CELL LINES AND PATIENT SAMPLES. FLT-3 and Mer tyrosine kinases have been previously identified as potential targets in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Expression of FLT-3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) occurs in -30-40% of AML patient samples and MerTK overexpression has been detected in ~80-100%. In this example, a novel small molecule inhibitor is tested for activity against both of these kinases and the growth inhibition or apoptosis of cell lines and patient myeloblasts is examined. In these studies, the effects of treatment with MER- TKI are analyzed in FLT3-ITD-positive (Molm-13 and MV4;11) and MERTK-positive (Kasumi-1 and U937) AML cell lines and in primary AML patient samples with variable expression of FLT3-ITD and MerTK. AML cell lines are also stained with Yo-Pro-1 iodide and propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry to determine induction of apoptosis in response to treatment with Mer TKI. Primary patient samples that are MerTK and/or FLT3-ITD positive are analyzed in similar assays. EXAMPLE 31. TARGETED INHIBITION OF MER TYROSINE KINASE IN THE TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT IN A MOUSE MODEL OF BREAST CANCER. To further investigate the utility of MerTK inhibition in the tumor microenvironment as a therapeutic strategy, the efficacy of a Mer TKI is evaluated in immunocompetent C57B1/6 mice implanted orrhotopically with PyVmT mammary gland tumor cells. These PyVmT tumors cells do not express MerTK, AXL or TYR03. EXAMPLE 32. MURINE FECL3-INDUCED CAROTID ARTERY THROMBOSIS MODEL. 6-12-week old C57BL/6 mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME), are fed low-soy laboratory chow to prevent interactions from genestein, a phytoestrogen with tyrosine kinase inhibitor activity. Approximately equal numbers of male and female mice are used for all experiments to limit any potential skewing of results by sex-based differences in thrombosis. The mice are anesthetized with intraperitoneal sodium pentobarbital (60 - 90 mg-kg"1 loading dose, 10 to 20 mg/kg"1 maintenance dose as needed to maintain adequate anesthesia as measured by paw pressure response). The mice are then fixed in the supine position to a polycarbonate experimental platform under a dissecting microscope (Olympus SZ61 Infinity Lite, Olympus Equipment). A rectal temperature probe is used in conjunction with a heating pad to monitor and maintain temperature at 37 ± 1°C. A 2 cm vertical midline ventral cervical incision is made to expose the trachea, which is then horizontally incised and cannulated with a rigid endotracheal tube (Harvard MiniVent type 845, Harvard Apparatus) secured with a 4-0 silk tie, and attached to a ventilator (Harvard MiniVent type 845, Harvard Apparatus), which delivered a 200 μΤ stroke volume and 80 breaths per minute. The carotid artery is exposed by dissection, allowing for attachment of a microvascular ultrasonic flow probe (Transonic Flowprobe, Transonic Systems, Ithaca, NY), and the cavity is flooded with NaCl to prevent tissue dehydration. A 1mm x 5mm strip of Parafilm (Pechiney Plastic Packaging, Chicago, IL) is placed perpendicular to, and immediately posterior to, the artery to separate it from other cavity tissue. NaCl (negative control), Mer TKI (3mg kg in NaCl), 2 μΜ abciximab (positive control), HD ADPis in NaCl (3 mg/kg MRS2179 + 3 mg/kg 2- MeSAMP), LD ADPis (1.5 mg/kg MRS2179 + 1.5 mg/kg 2-MeSAMP), or a combination of Mer TKI and LD ADPis are injected and allowed to circulate for 30 minutes. The cavity is then dried and a 1.2mm diameter circle of filter paper (Whatman Ltd, Chippenham, Wiltshire, UK) is saturated with 6% FeCl3 (-60 μΜ, Fisher) for 10 seconds, and placed on the artery, proximal to the ultrasound probe, for 3 minutes to create the injury. Then, the Parafilm and filter paper are removed, the cavity is flooded with saline, and the flow probe readout is analyzed using LabChart software (AD Instruments, CO Springs, CO). Elapsed Time To First (initial) artery Occlusion (TTFO, mean blood flow of 0 mL/min flow for >30 seconds), and total Duration Of Occlusion time (DOO, mean blood flow <20% of pre-FeCl3 baseline) is measured during the 60 minutes following FeCl3 application. Values are expressed as mean +/- SEM, with significance determined by unpaired, two-tailed Student's t-test. EXAMPLE 33. EFFECTS OF FLT3 AND MERTK INHIBITORS ON MERTK PHOSPHORYLATION AND DOWNSTREAM SIGNALING IN ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA CELL LINES Two cell lines known to express a FLT3-ITD mutation (Molml4 and MV4;11) are treated with a novel FLT3 inhibitor which has high specificity for FLT3. The MV4;11 cell line has low MerTK expression, while the Molml4 cell line does not express MerTK. Immunoprecipitation of FLT3-ITD positive AML cell lines after lh treatment with a MerTK inhibitor is analyzed for phosphorylation of FLT3 (pFLT3) in comparison to total FLT3. Phosphorylation of downstream signaling proteins STAT5, AKT, and ERKl/2 in comparison to DMSO and control TKI are also analyzed. In addition, an AML cell line that expresses MerTK and does not have activating mutations in FLT3 (U937, Kasumi-1) is also used to determine abrogation of activation of intracellular signaling pathways downstream of FLT3 and MerTK, including AKT and ERKl/2, when treated with MerTK inhibitors. Signaling in AML cell lines is analyzed after lhr treatment with MerTK inhibitors. Whole cell lysates or IPs are resolved on 8% Tris-Glycine SDS-PAGE gels, then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, which are probed for phospho-proteins. Blots are then stripped and re-probed for the total protein, or actin (loading control). EXAMPLE 34. EFFECT OF MERTK INHIBITORS ON APOPTOSIS IN ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA CELL LINES AML cell lines are plated in equal number in soft agar, then colony number analyzed after incubation at 37 °C for 14 days. Colonies are counted using a Gel Count automated colony counter. AML cell lines are treated for 72h with MerTK and apoptosis is analyzed after staining with Yo-Pro-1 iodide and propidium iodide and undergoing flow cytometric analysis. EXAMPLE 35. MERTK INHIBITORS IN A MOLM14 XENOGRAFT MODEL (FLT3-ITD AML) A Molml4 xenograft is established by injection of 2.5xl06 cells into NSG mice via tail vein. On day 4 after injection mice are started on daily therapy with a MerTK inhibitor or saline via oral gavage. Mice are treated through day 100 then observed for relapse. EXAMPLE 36. MERTK INHIBITORS IN A PATIENT-DERIVED XENOGRAFT MODEL (FLT3- ITD AML) A patient-derived xenograft model is established with cells from a patient with FLT3- ITD+ AML. NSG mice are sublethally irradiated and then 5x106 cells are injected via tail vein. Mice are started on therapy in the same fashion as described in Example 13 once peripheral blast counts reached ~10%. EXAMPLE 37. MERTK INHIBITORS IN FLT3-ITD AML CELL LINES WITH AC220- RESISTANCE MUTATIONS (D835Y AND F691L) Two cell line derivatives of the human FLT3-ITD AML cell line Molml4, which acquired either the D835Y (activation loop) or F691L (gatekeeper) mutation after selection in escalating doses of the FLT3 inhibitor AC220, are used to test the activity of MerTK inhibitors against clinically relevant FLT3 point mutations. Cells are analyzed for viability after 48 hours of culture in Molml4, Molml4:D835Y, and Molml4:F691L after treatment with a MerTK inhibitor. Phosphorylation is analyzed in Molml4, Molml4:D835Y, and Molml4:F691L after treatment with a MerTK inhibitor. Cell lines are also analyzed for resistance to treatment with AC220 at concentrations (e.g. 20-fold higher) than the inhibitory concentration in the parental line. EXAMPLE 38. MERTK INHIBITORS IN MOLM14 XENOGRAFT MODEL (FLT3-ITD AML) WITH AC220-RESISTANCE MUTATIONS (D835Y AND F691L) A Molml4:D835Y xenograft model is established by injection of 2.5xl06 Molml4:D835Y cells into NSG mice via tail vein. The D835Y mutation in the activation loop confers resistance to the FLT3 inhibitor AC220. On day 4 after injection, mice are started on daily therapy with a MerTK inhibitor, lOmg/kg AC220, or saline via oral gavage. Mice are treated through day 100 then observed for relapse.
