Physiological effects of fenpropimorph on wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae and fenpropimorph-resistant mutants.
Fenpropimorph-resistant mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were isolated by a gradient selection procedure.
The mutants were cross-resistant to other morpholines (fenpropidin, dodemorph, tridemorph) and 15-azasterol, but were susceptible to azoles (miconazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole) and nystatin.
In the absence of fenpropimorph, the major sterol produced by the mutants and the parental strain was ergosterol.
In the presence of fenpropimorph, ignosterol (ergosta-8,14-dien-3 beta-ol) was the major sterol produced by the mutants and the parental strain.
The resistance to fenpropimorph involves two recessive genes, each of which allows a semiresistance, when they are isolated apart from one another.
Strain JR4 (erg3 erg11), which produces 14-methylfecosterol [14 alpha-methyl-ergosta-8,24(28)-dien- 3-beta-ol) as the major sterol in the presence or absence of fenpropimorph, was also found to be resistant to the drug.
The growth inhibitory effect of fenpropimorph on wild-type cells appears to be linked to the production of ignosterol.
The uptake of exogenous sterol by wild-type cells was greatly enhanced in the presence of fenpropimorph.
The growth inhibition caused by fenpropimorph could only be overcome with bulk levels of exogenous C-5,6-unsaturated sterols.
