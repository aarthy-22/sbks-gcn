Glutathione S-transferase M1 and multidrug resistance protein 1 act in synergy to protect melanoma cells from vincristine effects.
Previous studies have shown that glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) can operate in synergy with efflux transporters, multi-drug resistance proteins (MRPs), to confer resistance to several carcinogens, mutagens and anticancer drugs.
To address the poorly documented role of the GSTM1 in cancer chemoresistance, we used CAL1 human melanoma cells expressing no endogenous GSTM1 and a high level of MRP1.
Cells were transfected with an expression vector containing the GSTM1 cDNA, and different clones were selected expressing different levels of GSTM1 (RT-PCR, Western blot, and enzyme activity).
Cells overexpressing GSTM1 displayed a 3- to 4-fold increase in resistance to anticancer drugs vincristine (VCR) and chlorambucil (CHB) in proliferation, cytotoxic, and clonogenic survival assays.
Inhibitors of MRP1 (sulfinpyrazone, verapamil) and GST (dicumarol, curcumin) completely reversed the GSTM1-associated resistance to VCR, indicating that a MRP efflux function is necessary to potentiate GSTM1-mediated resistance to VCR.
Conversely, MRP1 inhibitors had no effect on the sensitivity to CHB.
Using immunofluorescence assay, GSTM1 was also shown to protect microtubule network integrity from VCR-induced inhibition of microtubule polymerization.
In conclusion, these results show that GSTM1 alone is involved in melanoma resistance to CHB, whereas it can act in synergy with MRP1 to protect cells from toxic effects of VCR.
