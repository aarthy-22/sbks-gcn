EXTRACTION OF NITROGEN FROM ORGANIC MATERIALS THROUGH AMMONIFICATION BY MIXED BACTERIAL POPULATIONS TECHNICAL FIELD The present disclosure relates generally to a new process for producing ammonia and/or ammonium from organic raw materials by a process of microbial fermentation or culture using mixed population of microbes. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Ammonia (ΝΗ3) is one of the most produced chemical compounds in the world. The global production reached 131Μ metric tons in 2010 (US Geological Survey 2012). Most of the produced ammonia is used in chemical fertilizers to provide the nitrogen crops need for growing. Ammonia has also been used to produce plastics, synthetic fibers and resins, explosives, and numerous other chemical compounds. The nitrogen cycle is a process that converts nitrogen between its different chemical forms. Mineralization of nitrogen in organic macromolecules, i.e. conversion of organic nitrogen to ammonium or ammonia, is called ammonification. The release of organic nitrogen as ammonia is a part of the nitrogen cycle, and is performed by ammonifying bacteria. Ammonification can be utilized to release nitrogen from organic waste materials. For example, US patent application Ser. No. 13/722,228, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, discloses a method of ammonification. In the method of the ‘228 application, organic material present in a medium is contacted with a hydrolytic enzyme to produce a medium comprising hydrolyzed or partially hydrolyzed organic material suitable for microbial fermentation or culture. The fermentation is conducted in the presence of at least one microorganism capable of ammonification. The microorganism can belong, for example, to the genus of Aeromonas, Citrobacter, Clostridium and Entrococcus. The method provided ammonium production rates of up to about 800 mg/liter. US patent application Publ. No. US20110126455 describes a method for producing an inoculum, which can be used in the mineralization process for producing hydroponics. The inoculum created in the process is able to produce nitrate ion concentrations of up to 400 mg/1 and the time required to complete mineralization process is typically 4-8 days. Thus, there remains a longstanding need in the art for further economical methods for producing ammonia from organic material, e.g., organic waste material. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, there is provided a process for producing ammonia or ammonium from an organic material, the process including the steps of: fermenting, under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, an aqueous medium including organic material in the presence of a mixed bacterial population capable of ammonification, wherein the fermenting is under conditions, and for a sufficient period of time, to produce a fermentation product that comprises ammonia or ammonium; wherein the organic material includes nitrogenous compounds suitable for conversion to ammonia or ammonium. Preferably, the nitrogenous compounds are amines or proteins. In certain embodiments of the invention, the process is conducted at a temperature ranging between 30-60 degrees of Celsius. More preferably, the process is conducted at a temperature ranging from 40-55 degrees Celsius, or from 40-50 degrees of Celsius. In certain embodiments of the invention, the process is conducted at a pH ranging from about 5 to about 11. More preferably, the process is conducted at a pH ranging from about 6 to about 9. In certain embodiments of the invention, the fermentation process can be conducted under anaerobic or aerobic conditions in a suitable reaction chamber or vessel for a time period and in a temperature range effective for efficient reduction of the organic material. Preferably, the process is conducted with a mixed bacterial population that includes a mixed bacterial population substantially similar to a mixed bacterial population selected from the group consisting of HI, Cl, PI, SI, Al, ΡΒ-Μ, MF-M, FOl and FI1. The substantially similar mixed bacterial population preferably has a correlation coefficient of 0.80, more preferably a correlation coefficient of 0.90, and even more preferably a correlation coeficient of 0.95, relative to a mixed bacterial population selected from the group consisting of HI, Cl, PI, SI, Al, ΡΒ-Μ, MF-M, FOl and FI1. In certain embodiments, the mixed bacterial population is substantially similar to the mixed bacterial population of SI (CBS Accession No. 136063). The mixed bacterial population substantially similar to SI preferably preferably has a correlation coefficient of 0.80, more preferably a correlation coefficient of 0.90, and even more preferably a correlation coeficient of 0.95, relative to the mixed bacterial population of SI. In alternative embodiments, at least half of the cells in the mixed bacterial population comprise of Sporanaerobacter acetigenes and/or Clostridium spp. In another embodiment, the mixed bacterial population includes 50-95% Sporanaerobacter acetigenes and 3-35% Clostridium spp. The cumulative amount of Sporanaerobacter acetigenes and/or Clostridium spp is 70% or more. Preferably, the mixed bacterial population includes from 50-90% Sporanaerobacter acetigenes and 5-15% Clostridium spp. In a further embodiment, the cumulative amount of Sporanaerobacter acetigenes and/or Clostridium spp is 85% or more. In an additional embodiment, the mixed bacterial population comprises at least 90% bacteria belonging to the order Clostridiales. Preferably, the inventive process further includes recovering ammonia or ammonium, either mechanically or by precipitation, from the fermentation product. The ammonia or ammonium is optionally recovered by the steps of: (a) separating solid and liquid fermentation products; (b) collecting the liquid fermentation product comprising ammonia or ammonium-water or collecting a gas mixture released during the fermenting process or during separating step (a); and (c) recovering the ammonia or ammonium. In the process according to the invention, the organic material is preferably one or more of the following: meat-and bone meal (ΜΒΜ), animal meals, animal by-products, slaughterhouse waste, whey, municipal waste, food and fermentation industry waste streams and combinations thereof. The food industry waste streams are, for example, animal by-products, animal meals and food waste. In a still further embodiment, the invention includes a mixed bacterial population substantially similar to a mixed bacterial population selected from the group consisting of HI, Cl, PI, SI, Al, ΡΒ-Μ, MF-M, FOl and FI1. Preferably, the mixed bacterial population is substantially similar to the mixed bacterial population of SI.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION A method for extraction of nitrogen from organic materials through ammonification by mixed bacterial populations is provided. An organic material can be any protein-rich organic material e.g., of animal or plant origin. In order to more clearly appreciate the invention, the following terms are defined. The terms listed below, unless otherwise indicated, will be used and are intended to be defined as indicated. Definitions for other terms can occur throughout the specification. It is intended that all singular terms also encompass the plural, active tense and past tense forms of a term, unless otherwise indicated. The term "nitrogenous compounds" refers to nitrogen compounds suitable for conversion to ammonia or ammonium by the process of the invention, e.g., organic nitrogen, including amines, proteins and the like. Examples of such organic material include amine containing material, e.g., proteinacious material such as, e.g., meat-and bone meal (ΜΒΜ), slaughterhouse waste, whey, municipal waste, fish meal, food industry waste streams, e.g., animal and plant by-products including, but not limited to, the meal of meat-and-bone, fish, and feathers, as well as beet root, legumes, fruit, and sugar industry waste. The term “MBM” “meat-and-bone meal” as employed herein as defined by European Union Commission Regulation No. 142/2011 “meat-and-bone meal means animal protein derived from the processing of Category 1 or Category 2 materials in accordance with one of the processing methods set out in Chapter III of Annex IV”. The term ’’animal meal” as employed herein is a meal produced from animal materials (such as slaughterhouse waste). In the Examples hereinbelow, ’’animal meal” was a powder-like material. One process of manufacturing the meal is to take slaughterhouse waste and extract moisture (i.e., dry it) and then mill the dried solids. The”plant-derived materials” are defined as follows. ’’Bioethanol mask” (Stl Oy, Finland) refers to fermentation waste originating from bioethanol production. ’’Barley briquette” (Senson Oy, Finland) was a by-product of wort production, and ’’Barley mask” (Senson Oy, Finland) was a by-product of barley enzyme production. ’’Wheat briquette” (CropEnergies AG, Germany) and ’’Rape cake” (Mildola Oy, Finland) were materials produced to be fed to animals. The term “animal feed” as used herein describes food prepared for feeding to animals. The terms "fermenting" or "fermentation" refer to a process where organic molecules serve as both electron donors and acceptors. It differs from respiration, where electrons derived from nutrient molecules are donated to oxygen (aerobic respiration) or other inorganic molecules/ions such as nitrate, sulfate, carbon dioxide or ferric iron (anaerobic respiration). In fermentation, nutrient molecules are reduced to small organic molecules such as volatile fatty acids and alcohols. In addition to this, the term fermentation is used to describe microbial growth on a growth medium within a closed vessel, i.e. bioreactor or fermentor. The term “ammonia” refers to the compound Ν¾ found in gaseous form or dissolved in a non-ionized form in a medium e.g., an aqueous medium. The term “ammonium” refers to the ion ΝΗ/ that is the ionic form of Ν¾ found in e.g., aqueous solution. In aqueous solution, ammonium and ammonia occur in an equilibrium that is dependent on temperature and pH, e.g. the higher the temperature and the pH, the greater the proportion that is in the form of ammonia. For this reason, reference to “ammonia” herein with regard to the inventive process and/or ammonification microorganisms and products thereof should be understood to include reference to both Ν¾ and ΝΗ/ forms of this compound, unless otherwise indicated. For example, discussion of ammonification microorganisms as “ammonia producing” or “ammonium producing” is understood to include production of Ν¾ and/or NH4+ according to the ΝΗ3/ΝΗ/ equilibrium found in the particular medium. The term ammonification refers to mineralization of nitrogen in organic macromolecules, i.e. conversion of organic nitrogen to ammonium or ammonia. It is performed by ammonifying bacteria and consists of enzymatic hydrolysis of proteins to amino acids, and release of nitrogen as ammonium/ammonia through deamination and elimination reactions. Carbon backbones of amino acids are fermented to organic acids with simultaneous release of carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The term "unified form," as may be used herein in the context of recovery of ammonium and ammonia from the fermentation or culture products, refers to conversion of ammonium ions into another chemical form such as nonionic ammonia (ΝΗ3) and/or any art known nitrogen containing compound, e.g., a compound which is formed by ammonia reacting with nitric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, or phosphoric acid, or some other compound, respectively. The ammonifying mixed bacterial populations include populations HI, Cl, PI, SI, Al, ΡΒ-Μ, MF-M, FOl and FI1 and variations thereon, and they are described hereinbelow in detail. Bacterial community analysis of mixed populations HI, Cl, PI, SI, and Al was performed on DNA obtained by phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extraction from bacterial cultures where cells had been disrupted by bead beating. Populations had been cultured for four days at 37 °C, 50 °C or 55 °C in sterile ΜΒΜ medium [180 g meat-and-bone meal (ΜΒΜ) per liter of water] or animal-origin materials. Bacterial 16S gene assay by tag-encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing (bTEFAP) and bacterial diversity data analysis were performed by the Research and Testing Lab (Lubbock, Texas, USA) as described by Dowd et al. 2008a and Wolcott et al. 2009. Primers 28F ‘GAGTTTGATCNTGGCTCAG’ (SEQ ID NO: 1) and 519R 'GTNTTACNGCGGCKGCTG’ (SEQ ID NO: 2) were used for amplification of 16S variable regions Vl-3 (wherein “N” is A, T/U, G or C) and wherein Κ is T/U or G). Bacterial diversity analysis revealed the presence of bacteria belonging to 35 different genera (Table 1). Of the total of 53 results, 33 were identified at the species level and 20 at the genus level. TABLE 2 presents the predominant bacterial genera and species in each population. Bacteria belonging to 6-8 genera form the majority of all populations. Clostridium spp. and Sporanaerobacter acetigenes are predominant in all populations. In SI cultured at 55 °C, Caloramator spp. is as common as Clostridium spp. Correlation coefficients (TABLE 3) were calculated from data presented in TABLE 1 using equation [1], where X and Υ refer to two matrices, e.g. HI and Cl, between which the correlation is calculated, χ and y are single values within a matrix, and χ and y are the means of all values within a matrix. Species not present in the population (empty cells in TABLE 1) were assigned a value 0. Correl(X,Y) = Σ (*-*)(y-y) λ/Σ(χ-χ)2 Σ(:y-y)2 [1] The term “substantially similar” with respect to a bacterial population as disclosed herein, means that a bacterial population has a correlation coefficient of at least 0.8 when compared to one or more of the bacterial populations defined by TABLE 1. Preferably, a substantially similar bacterial population has a correlation coefficient of at least 0.9, and more preferably, a substantially similar bacterial population has a correlation coefficient of at least 0.95 when compared to one or more of the bacterial populations defined by TABLE 1. Other statistical methods for comparing populations can be used as well. TABLE 3 shows a very high similarity between all populations at the age of 4 days. The majority of all populations comprises of only a few species and genera, remaining very similar under all conditions tested and outcompeting innate populations present in animal-origin materials. PI is the eight generation of a population created from non-sterile ΜΒΜ, and shows the main characteristics of the population are retained. Bacterial diversity analyses based on sequencing molecular methods are biased due to e.g. primer specificity and universality (Dowd et αℓ. 2008b). Therefore, the method described hereinabove must be used as a standard when comparisons to the mixed populations presented hereinbelow are performed. TABLE 1. Bacterial diversity analysis results: genera and species in populations HI, Cl, PI, SI, and Al. SI population was also cultured at 37 °C (marked as Sl-37), 50 °C (marked as Sl-50, a biological replicate of SI) and 55 °C (marked as Sl-55). SI was also used to inoculate 20 % (weight/volume) chicken by-product (CBP), crushed porcine and bovine bone (CB), fish by-product (MF), porcine-bovine by-product (ΡΒ) and chicken feathers (FE). Cells from all cultures were harvested for DNA extraction at the age of four days. The results are expressed as percentage of total population. 5 Α1 Cl HI PI SI Sl-37 Sl-50 Sl-55 CBP CB MF ΡΒ FE ssp. 0.770 0.530 1.463 0.974 0.398 0.763 1.183 0.105 2.203 0.127 0.031 s lamylovorans 0.224 0.106 0.506 0.394 0.085 0.117 0.283 0.049 0.016 ibrio fibrisolvens 0.021 'probacter 7 0.050 0.042 0.113 0.021 0.085 0.035 0.111 0.105 0.030 0.021 nator fervidus 0.021 motor sp 5.045 2.669 4.295 4.042 5.200 5.765 3.608 3.351 0.126 3.378 1.623 3.176 1.369 octerium ns 0.021 0.015 cter sp 0.021 0.012 0.030 0.019 Hum botulinum 6.948 6.613 4.632 1.415 4.913 0.129 1.130 1.429 1.173 6.234 0.252 Hum cochlearium 5.790 6.439 6.920 11.84 8.497 10.98 2.054 0.023 2.888 5.983 2.933 2.162 0.960 Hum gasigenes 0.015 Hum yticum 0.064 0.014 0.063 'ium novyi 0.084 ium oceanicum 0.064 0.021 0.057 0.014 0.029 ium perfringens 0.136 ium sp 0.224 0.487 0.619 0.124 0.568 0.069 0.569 1.242 0.419 0.506 0.168 0.672 0.283 ium sporogenes 0.547 0.530 1.182 0.187 0.483 0.380 2.304 0.305 3.035 1.667 0.220 4.120 0.031 ium oolmarium 0.012 ium ultunense 2.584 5.507 0.844 15.17 1.250 1.105 0.999 1.464 0.230 0.893 1.917 0.224 2.202 octerium istedtii 0.015 bacterium lenitalium 0.015 0.016 icterium sp 0.016 occus faecalis 0.079 occus sp 0.063 octerium sp 0.019 0.035 0.049 οℓα teens 0.021 0.014 isp 0.075 0.085 0.038 0.083 0.028 0.069 0.056 0.012 0.060 0.021 0.058 er grbiciae 0.010 sp 0.035 zillus crispotus 0.041 zillus johnsonii 0.047 ra broomii 0.021 KCUS icus 1.935 australiensis 0.547 0.360 0.338 0.352 0.426 | 0.483 0.500 0.340 0.402 0.115 0.273 0.173 Microbacterium aurum 0.021 Mycobacterium phocaicum 0.016 Propionibacterium acnes 0.012 0.021 0.010 Propionibacterium sp 0.028 Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis 0.028 0.015 Pseudomonas sp Rhodobacter sp 0.019 Ruminococcus sp 0.014 0.016 Sarcina sp 0.016 Sphingomonas mucosissima 0.021 Sporanaerobacter acetigenes 11 AH 74.26 80.66 53.67 75.87 78.63 81.96 85.45 90.62 81.08 90.80 81.17 92.24 Sporichthya sp 0.035 Subdoligranulum sp 0.010 Tepidanaerobacter sp 2.261 1.419 1.219 4.167 0.682 0.791 5.319 0.837 0.253 0.429 0.438 Thermosediminibacter sp 0.010 Tissierella creatinophila 0.021 0.021 Tissierella praeacuta 0.021 0.042 0.023 0.030 0.021 Tissierella sp 4.448 0.381 1.782 2.218 1.677 1.001 1.277 0.867 0.398 1.697 0.555 1.003 0.220 Verrucomicrobium sp 0.016 TABLE 2.

EXAMPLE 1 OPTIMAL CONDITIONS FOR AMMONIFICATION BY MIXED POPULATIONS To determine the optimal temperature range for ammonification by mixed populations, Al, Cl, HI, PI and SI were cultured in sterile ΜΒΜ medium [180 g meat-and-bone meal (ΜΒΜ) per liter of water] at 50 °C (degrees of Celsius) without aeration for 3 days (d). These cultures, which had reached stationary growth phase, were used as 5 % (ν/ν) (volume per volume) inocula in ΜΒΜ medium in a total volume of 60 mL (milliliter). Inoculated cultures were incubated at various temperatures without aeration for 7 d (days). Growth of the mixed bacterial populations was monitored by measuring the ammonium production of the populations. A maximal ammonia level of about 8-10 g/1 was repeatedly determined for culture growth under the conditions described above. Therefore, when the ammonia concentration reached this level, it was interpreted as transition to stationary phase of growth. The diverse nature of the populations restricted the use of culture based methods for cell counting, and opacity of the ΜΒΜ medium prevented the use of optical density measurement for estimation of cell densities. In all the following examples, “inocula of mixed bacterial populations” refer to bacterial cultures, which have reached stationary growth phase. The extent of ammonification was determined by measuring the ammonia concentration in the inoculated ΜΒΜ by Ammonium Test 1.10024.0001 (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The result was confirmed with the Ammonia Assay Kit ΑΑ0100 (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Nitrogen content of ΜΒΜ was determined with the Kjeldahl method by an accredited testing laboratory (Novalab Oy, Karkkila, Finland). Based on this, a maximum ammonia level i.e. the concentration where all proteinacious nitrogen is converted to ammonia was calculated. Nitrogen conversion percentage, i.e. the extent of ammonification of proteinacious nitrogen, was then calculated on the basis of ammonia concentration in the samples. The results are presented in FIG. 1. The optimal temperature range for ammonification by Al, Cl, HI and PI is 37-55 °C and by SI 37-60 °C. However, SI was more temperature tolerant than Al, Cl, HI and PI as SI retained some of its ammonification efficiency even at room temperature (RT, 23 °C) and 70 °C. To determine the optimal pH range for ammonification by mixed populations, Al, Cl, HI, PI, and SI were cultured in sterile ΜΒΜ medium [180 g ΜΒΜ per liter of water] at 50 °C without aeration for 3 d. These cultures were used as 5 % (ν/ν) inocula in ΜΒΜ medium in a total volume of 60 mL. The pH of these cultures was then adjusted daily to values ranging from pH 5 to 12. Cultures were incubated at 50 °C for 7 d without aeration. The percentage of nitrogen converted to ammonia was then determined as described hereinabove. The results are presented in FIG. 2. The optimal pH range for ammonification by Al, Cl, HI, PI, and SI is about pH 6 to about pH 9. All of Cl, PI and SI show a decrease in ammonification efficiency at pH values below and above the pH 6-9 optimum. It should be noted that population HI is, however, more tolerant of high pH than the other populations, showing some activity at pH 11, whereas Al tolerates low pH, also showing activity at pH 5. To determine optimal oxygen conditions for ammonification by mixed populations, SI was cultured in sterile ΜΒΜ medium [180 g ΜΒΜ per liter of water] at 50 °C without aeration for 3 d. These cultures were used as 5 % (ν/ν) inocula in ΜΒΜ medium in a total volume of 60 mL. The cultures were incubated anaerobically (in an anaerobic jar with AnaeroGen, Oxoid), microaerobically (in bottles with closed cap), or aerobically (in Erlenmeyer flasks with shaking at speed 90 rpm) at +50 °C for 7 days. Two replicate experiments of each condition were done. Ammonium production of the cultures was measured after 3 and 7 days cultivation using enzymatic determination kit for ammonia (Ammonia Assay Kit ΑΑ0100; Sigma-Aldrich), and the percentage of nitrogen converted to ammonia was then determined as described hereinabove. Ammonia production of the SI population was not dependent on oxygen level of the cultures. Ammonia yields were 52.5-55.9 % in all of the oxygen conditions, after 7 days cultivation (TABLE 4). In conclusion, ammonium production of the SI population was not dependent on the oxygen level of the medium. TABLE 4. Percentages of nitrogen converted to ammonium by SI population cultivated at different oxygen conditions. The results represent averages of two biological replicate experiments. Standard deviations of three replicate measurements from the two biological replicates are shown. % of Ν converted to ammonia 3 days 1 days Anaerobic 47.6 ± 4.8 % 53.6 ± 4.3 % Microaerobic 40.9 ± 3.7 % 52.5 ± 3.2 % Aerobic 46.4 ± 8.8 % 55.9 ± 5.4 % Conclusions. The working range for ammonification of proteinacious materials with mixed bacteria populations was determined. Temperatures from 30 °C to 60 °C, more particularly from 37-55 °C and pH 5-11, more particularly from pH 6-9, were the best for bacterial ammonification with the populations described here. Ammonification works in anaerobic, microaerobic, and aerobic conditions using the mixed populations. EXAMPLE 2 ENHANCED AMMONIFICATION OF ORGANIC MATERIALS Mixed bacterial populations HI, Cl, PI, SI, and Α1 were employed in ammonification of proteinacious nitrogen in various organic, i.e. animal- and plant-origin materials, as defined hereinbelow. Animal-origin ΜΒΜ. The MBMs (designated infra as ΜΒΜ1 and ΜΒΜ2, respectively, were produced from animal by-products according to methods described in EU Commission Regulation 142/2011, and consisted of category 3 (EC Regulation 1069/2009) low infection risk material. In particular, ΜΒΜ1 was obtained from Findest Protein Oy, Finland, and ΜΒΜ2 was obtained from SARIA Bio-Industries AG & Co. KG, Germany. Feather meal was obtained from Findest Protein Oy, Finland, and Fish meal was a Polish product obtained from Henry Teirs Ltd, Finland. Fresh animal-origin materials. Fresh slaughter by-products of broiler chicken and bovine/porcine origin were used. The broiler by-product consisted of intestines, gizzard, liver, heart, heads, blood, toes, bones, cervical vertebrae, skin of the neck, and visceral fat. The Bovine/porcine by-product consisted of porcine skin, muscle, cartilage, cartilaginous bone, small intestine, heart, lung, kidney, liver, and suet; and bovine muscle, cartilaginous bone, trachea, lung, suet, and green tripe. Fish by-product consisted of fish waste including bone, muscle, skin and viscera. Ground feather was washed feather ground to < 2 cm particle size. Bovine blood was food grade frozen blood. All fish, poultry, porcine and bovine materials were of Finnish origin. Plant-derived materials. Bioethanol mask (Stl Oy, Finland) was fermentation waste originating from bioethanol production, Barley briquette (Senson Oy, Finland) was a by-product of wort production, and Barley mask (Senson Oy, Finland) was a by-product of barley enzyme production. Wheat briquette (CropEnergies AG, Germany) and Rape cake (Mildola Oy, Finland) were animal feed materials. Fresh animal-origin materials were applied as 40 % (weight/volume) homogenates and animal-origin meals and plant-derived materials in the concentration of 180 g per liter. Homogenates and solutions were prepared in tap water in a total volume of 60 mL. The pH of homogenates and solutions was adjusted with NaOH to pH 7 if the initial pH was below 7. In addition, plant-origin materials Barley mask, Rape cake, Wheat briquette, and Barley briquette required daily adjustment of pH to 7 after inoculation since pH in these materials dropped to a value below the optimum range for ammonification by mixed populations. Bioethanol mask and all animal-origin materials did not require pH adjustment after inoculation. Bacterial populations HI, Cl, PI, SI, and Α1 were cultured in sterile medium [180 g ΜΒΜ per liter of water] at 50 °C without aeration for 3 d. These cultures were used as 5 % (ν/ν) inocula in homogenates and solutions of organic materials. Inoculated materials and non-inoculated controls were incubated at 50 °C without aeration. The extent of ammonification was determined by measuring the ammonia concentration in the inoculated organic materials by Ammonium Test 1.10024.0001 (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The result was confirmed with the Ammonia Assay Kit ΑΑ0100 (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Nitrogen content of the organic materials was determined with the Kjeldahl method by an accredited testing laboratory (Novalab Oy, Karkkila, Finland). Based on this, a maximum ammonia level ℓ℮. the concentration where all proteinacious nitrogen is converted to ammonia was calculated for each organic material. Nitrogen conversion percentage, i.e. the extent of ammonification of proteinacious nitrogen, was then calculated on the basis of ammonia concentration in the samples. The results are presented in TABLE 5. Conclusions. The results show enhanced ammonification by mixed bacterial populations HI, Cl, PI, SI, and Α1 as compared to non-inoculated controls. Endogenous bacterial populations are responsible for some extent of ammonification particularly in fresh animal-origin materials, but the process is accelerated by the mixed populations. Plant-based materials show very little endogenous ammonification activity in the conditions used, and benefit significantly from inoculated populations. Populations HI and SI seemed to be the most efficient populations in ammonification. SI population was the best ammonium producer on fish by-products, fish meal, and ΜΒΜ2. HI population was the best ammonium producer on porcine/bovine by-product, ΜΒΜ1, and bioethanol mask. SI and HI populations were not the weakest ammonium producers on any material. FIGs. 3Α-3Η illustrate the ammonification efficiency of different organic materials by mixed populations HI, Cl, PI, SI, and Al. The organic materials are FIG. 3Α: Fish by-product, FIG. 3Β: Broiler by-product, FIG. 3C: Bovine/porcine by-product, FIG. 3D: Bioethanol mask, FIG. 3Ε: Meat-and-bone meal 1, FIG. 3F: Meat-and-bone meal 2, FIG. 3G: Fish meal, FIG. 3Η: Feather meal. The results are presented as the percentage of nitrogen converted to ammonia, i.e. ammonification efficiency after incubation at 50 °C for various periods of time. Population SI stands out as it efficiently ammonified the materials of FIGs. 3Α, 3D and 3G, respectively, whereas HI rapidly ammonifies materials of FIGs. 3Α, 3C, 3D and 3Ε, respectively. All in all, all five populations increase the ammonification efficiency compared to non-inoculated controls. This effect is especially evident in materials 3C, 3D, 3Ε, and 3F. FIGS. 3Α, 3Β, 3C, 3D, 3Ε, 3F, 3G and 3Η show results for the materials of FIGs. 3Α, 3Β, 3C, 3D, 3Ε, 3F, 3G and 3Η, respectively. TABLE 5, The efficiency of nitrogen conversion to ammonia reported as percentage of maximum. Determination was performed 24 hours from inoculation for the fish, broiler, and porcine/bovine by-products and fish meal, 48 hours from inoculation for meat-and-bone meals, and 168 hours (7 days) from inoculation for feather meal, ground feather, blood and all plant-derived materials. Controls of plant-derived materials were not pH-adjusted. n.d. = not determined.

EXAMPLE 3 AMMONIFICATION OF MIXED ORGANIC MATERIALS (EFFECT OF CARBOHYDRATE CONTENT ON AMMONIFICATION) Sugar. The effect of glucose or starch addition on ammonia production of SI population was tested on a 40 % (weight/volume) chicken by-product medium. Glucose or starch was added in the medium in 1 %, 5 % and 10 % concentrations. SI population (cultivated on 180 g/1 ΜΒΜ medium) was added as 5 % (ν/ν) inoculum in 60 ml of different media, and the cultures were incubated at +50 °C for 2 days. Two replicate experiments with each media were done. Ammonium production was measured after 2 days cultivation using enzymatic determination kit for ammonia (Ammonia Assay Kit ΑΑ0100; Sigma-Aldrich). Results. Ammonia production by the SI population was negatively affected by addition of sugars in the medium (Table 6). Without carbohydrate additions, ammonia yield was 60 % after 2 days cultivation. Addition of glucose in medium reduced ammonia yields to 34-48 %.\% starch did not reduce ammonia yields, but 5 % and 10 % starch additions reduced ammonia yields to 45 % and 37 %, respectively. The lower ammonia yields were associated with lowered pH in the media. In conclusion, ammonium production of SI population is negatively affected by addition of sugar in the growth medium. TABLE 6. The effect of sugar or starch additions on ammonia production of SI population on 40 % chicken by-product medium was tested. Ammonium production was measured after 2 days cultivation at +50 °C. The results are averages of two biological replicate experiments.

SI population was used to ammonify mixtures of materials of plant and animal origin. Culture media with 5 percent dry weight were prepared. Media contained following materials, one material at a time or two materials in 50 % + 50 % proportion: minced chicken by-products (200 g/1 alone, 100 g/1 in 50-50 mixtures), minced fish by-products (200 g/1 alone, 100 g/1 in 50-50 mixtures), dried Chlorella algae powder (50 g/1 alone, 25 g/1 in 50-50 mixtures), and barley briquette (50 g/1 alone, 25 g/1 in 50-50 mixtures). Barley briquettes were mixed also in other proportions with chicken and fish by-products, so that the total dry weight content of the media were always 5 %. The materials contained nitrogen as follows: chicken 22.2 g/kg, fish 30.4 g/kg, Chlorella 113.6 g/kg, and barley 24.6 g/kg. 7.5 ml of SI population cultivated in ΜΒΜ medium (180 g/1) was inoculated in 150 ml of each media. Two replicate experiments of each media were done. The cultures were incubated at +50 °C and ammonium production of the cultures was measured after 4 or 7 days cultivation using a quantitative, enzymatic determination kit for ammonia (Ammonia Assay Kit ΑΑ0100; Sigma-Aldrich) for biological samples, according to manufacturer's instructions. Results (I). Ammonium was produced in all the materials and their mixtures tested. Nitrogen was converted to ammonia in highest levels (the ammonia yields were highest) in media containing animal materials, that is chicken and fish (72-78 %). In media containing plant materials, that is, Chlorella and barley, the yields were lower (Table 7). When all the 4 materials were mixed in a medium in 25 % + 25 % + 25 % + 25 % proportions, ammonia yield was 67.5 ± 6.7 % in 4 days. TABLE 7. Ammonia production of SI population in media containing different materials and their mixtures in 4 days. The results are averages of two biological replicate experiments. Standard deviations of three replicate measurements from the two biological replicates are shown. Chicken Fish Chlorella Barley briquet Chicken Fish Chlorella Barley briquet 78.1 ± 16.6% 71.9 ± 7.9 % 59.2 ± 9.3 % 37.3 ± 11.1 % 80.2 ± 4.5 % 59.6 ± 5.4 % 66.2 ± 17.1 % 36.0 ± 9.7 % 25.7 ± 7.6 % 23.8 ± 5.4 % (7 days cultivation) The yields in media containing barley were increased by addition of base to the media during cultivation. When the pH of the cultures was kept at 7-8 by addition of NaOH to the cultures (in the beginning and after 1, 4, 5, and 6 days cultivation), the ammonia yields after 4 days cultivation were as follows: 54.5 ± 9.0 % in media containing chicken and barley, 35.6 ± 4.4 % in media containing Chlorella and barley, and 61.2 ± 7.1 % in barley medium (after 7 days cultivation). Referring to the results of negative effect of carbohydrate addition on ammonification, the acidifying effect of barley could be a result of its higher carbohydrate content compared to animal materials. Results (II). Barley briquettes were also mixed with chicken by-products and fish by-products in different proportions to determine whether the acidifying effect of barley could be avoided by addition of animal materials in medium in sufficient amounts. These experiments were done in 60 ml volumes. TABLE 8 shows that in media containing chicken by-products, the maximum proportion of barley in this medium was 30 % and after that, the pH dropped under 5 and the ammonia yields were 21 % at maximum. In media containing fish by-products, the ammonia yields decreased significantly, when there was less than 40 % fish in the medium, and the pH also dropped under pH 5. TABLE 8.

Standard deviations of three replicate measurements from the two biological replicates are shown.

Mixtures of minced fish waste and minced food waste were also ammonified by the SI population. Media containing 40 g raw materials in 100 ml volume were prepared from fish waste with nitrogen content of 27.1 g/kg and food waste with nitrogen content of 10.1 g/kg. The food waste contained both plant and animal materials. Media were adjusted to neutral pH 7. SI population cultivated in ΜΒΜ medium (180 g/1) was added as 5 % (ν/ν) inoculum in 60 ml of each media. The cultures were incubated at +50 °C and ammonium production of the cultures was measured after 3 days cultivation using enzymatic determination kit for ammonia (Ammonia Assay Kit ΑΑ0100; Sigma-Aldrich). Results. The SI population converted 55-72 % of the nitrogen in the media to ammonium in the media containing at least 60 % fish waste and at maximum 40 % of food waste (Table 9). If there was 50 % or less fish waste in the medium, the pH of the cultures dropped to pH 5 or lower, and the ammonia yields decreased to 8-16 %. In Example 3 it was also shown that the addition of carbohydrates in the medium caused acidification of the medium and it also had negative effect on ammonification. The high carbohydrate content of food waste is probably the reason for the observed acidification of the media, if its portion in the medium is too high, that is, more than 40 %. TABLE 9. Ammonia production and pH of SI population cultivated in media containing different proportions of fish and food wastes in 3 days. Standard deviations of three replicate measurements are shown. Medium Ammonia yield (%) PH 100 % fish 61.0 ±5.8 7.5 90 % fish - 10 % food 59.9 ± 3.2 7.5 80 % fish - 20 % food 55.5 ± 2.2 7.3 70 % fish - 30 % food 57.8 ± 5.0 7.3 60 % fish - 40 % food 72.2 ± 2.7 7.0 50 % fish - 50 % food 16.1 ±0.6 5.0 40 % fish - 60 % food 13.6 ±0.8 5.0 30 % fish - 70 % food 7.7 ± 0.3 4.5 20 % fish - 80 % food 8.3 ± 0.8 4.5 10 % fish - 90 % food 7.7 ± 1.2 4.5 100 % food 8.8 ± 1.2 4.5 Conclusions. Mixtures of various materials were ammonified using the SI population. Generally, plant materials were ammonified less efficiently than animal materials. While not wishing to be bound by any hypothesis or theory of the invention, it is possible that this observation is explained by acidification of the medium during cultivation. Acidification of media can be avoided with addition of base in the culture. Also if plant and animal materials were mixed in appropriate proportions, acidification was avoided and higher ammonia yields were achieved. EXAMPLE 4 AMMONIFICATION IN PILOT SCALE The power of the SI bacterial population in the ammonification of fresh animal materials was shown in 20-25 liters scale. Closed 30 liter vessels made of steel, each containing a temperature controlling system and a stirring mechanism, were used for these fermentation or culture processes. The growth media were 20 % suspensions made from broiler by-products or fish by-products. In part of the experiments, 2.5 % or 5 % (ν/ν) inoculum of SI population, cultivated in 180 g/1 ΜΒΜ medium, was added in the culture. The cultures were incubated with moderate constant stirring at +37 °C or at +50 °C for 2-3 days. Ammonia production was measured daily using enzymatic determination kit for ammonia (Ammonia Assay Kit ΑΑ0100; Sigma-Aldrich). Results. When chicken by-products were incubated at +50 °C, in 20 liters volume, the addition of 5 % SI inoculum in the culture was shown to increase ammonia yields significantly ( FIG. 4), from 5 % to 72 % in 40.5 hours. With fish by-products, in 25 liters volume, the addition of 2.5 % SI inoculum increased ammonia yields from 71 % to 91 % in 39.5 hours, when the cultures were incubated at +50 °C. In fish by-product fermentation or culture processes with the SI population, cultivation temperatures +37 °C and +50 °C were compared. After 24 hours of culture, the ammonia yields were higher, 80 ± 6 %, at +50 °C and lower, 58 ± 6 % at +37 °C. This confirmed that +50 °C is a good temperature for ammonification of proteinacious materials with the SI bacteria population. Conclusions. These results, achieved at 20-25 liters scale, confirmed the results of Example 2, which showed that the addition of a bacteria population increased the ammonia yields in media containing animal derived materials. EXAMPLE 5 INDUCTION OF MIXED POPULATIONS FROM MEAT-AND-BONE MEAL Α1 population was created as follows: Aspergillus oryzae CECT 2095 was cultivated on potato dextrose agar (ATCC medium 336, recipe is as follows: Boil 300 grams of finely diced potatoes in 500 ml of water until thoroughly cooked. Filter and add water to filtrate to 1000 ml. Add 20 g glucose and 15 g agar, and autoclave at 121°C.) for about 7 days. Three milliliters of potato dextrose liquid medium (prepared as potato dextrose agar but without addition of agar) was poured on the A. oryzae agar culture, and the suspension was transferred in 100 ml of potato dextrose medium. The culture was incubated at room temperature with gentle shaking for 3 days. Then, a solid state medium of ΜΒΜ1 was prepared by mixing 36 g non-sterile ΜΒΜ1 with 50 ml of tap water. 10 ml of A. oryzae liquid culture was inoculated on the solid state medium, and the culture was incubated at +30 °C for 16 days. Then, water was added in the culture to get concentration of 180 g ΜΒΜ per liter of water. This liquid culture was incubated at +50 °C for 4 days. Cl population was created by mixing non-sterile ΜΒΜ1 with cold tap water in a proportion of 180 g ΜΒΜ per liter of water. ΜΒΜ was cultured without aeration at 50 °C until Ν¾ concentration leveled out, and stationary growth phase was reached as explained in EXAMPLE 1. HI population was created by mixing non-sterile ΜΒΜ1 with boiling tap water in a proportion of 180 g ΜΒΜ per liter of water. The mixture was let cool to room temperature. ΜΒΜ was cultured without aeration at 50 °C until Ν¾ concentration leveled out, and stationary growth phase was reached as explained in EXAMPLE 1. PI population was created by mixing non-sterile ΜΒΜ1 with cold tap water in a proportion of 45 g ΜΒΜ per liter of water. The mixture was buffered to pH 9 with 20 mM MOPS, and cultured without aeration at 50 °C. The culture that had reached stationary growth phase was then used to inoculate sterile ΜΒΜ1 medium, and cultured without aeration at 50 °C until stationary phase. Inoculation and culturing were repeated seven times. Therefore, PI represents the 8th generation of original ΜΒΜ1 population. SI population was created by mixing non-sterile ΜΒΜ2 with cold tap water in a proportion of 180 g ΜΒΜ per liter of water. ΜΒΜ was cultured without aeration at 50 °C until NH3 concentration leveled out, and stationary growth phase was reached as explained in EXAMPLE 1. All populations were maintained by storing the liquid culture at +4 °C. This culture was used to inoculate the cultures used in EXAMPLES 1 to 6. Effect of temperature. To determine the optimal temperature for enrichment of ammonifying bacteria populations from non-sterile ΜΒΜ, non-sterile ΜΒΜ media (180 g ΜΒΜ1 or ΜΒΜ2 per liter of cold tap water) were prepared and buffered to pH 7.5-8 with 20 mM MOPS. The media were incubated at various temperatures between room temperature (RT) and 80 °C for 7 days without aeration. Ν¾ concentrations were determined as explained in EXAMPLE 1. Results are presented in FIG. 5. Results. The optimum temperature for inducing a population on ΜΒΜ1 is 50 °C (FIG. 5.). The slightly lower temperature, 45 °C, seems to lie between a mesophilic and thermophilic population as seen from the high deviation between results at this temperature. In some of the biological replicate samples there was high nitrogen conversion efficiency, whereas some showed low recoveries. The thermophilic population has a sharp optimum, as at 55°C the population is not induced in all biological replicate samples. ΜΒΜ2 had a high potential for population induction at a wide range of temperatures, RT-70 °C. ΜΒΜ2 population is active in ammonification at a wider range of temperatures than ΜΒΜ1 population Effect of pH. To determine the optimal pH for enrichment of ammonifying bacteria populations from non-sterile ΜΒΜ, non-sterile ΜΒΜ media (180 g ΜΒΜ per liter of water) were prepared and their pH was adjusted at different levels (pH 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12) or left unadjusted. These media were incubated at +50 °C for 7 days without aeration. During the cultivation, in one experiment the pH’s were adjusted on the original level at days 1, 2, 3, and 4. In another experiment, pH was not adjusted during cultivation. Meat-and-bone meals from two different manufacturers (ΜΒΜ1 and ΜΒΜ2) were tested. Results. The optimal pH range for enrichment of ammonifying populations from ΜΒΜ1 was 7-9, if pH of the cultures was adjusted daily (TABLE 10). If pH was adjusted only in the beginning of the cultivation, optimal pH range was 8-11. In ΜΒΜ2, optimal pH range was 6-9, if pH was adjusted daily. If pH was adjusted only in the beginning of the experiment, pH’s from 5 to 11 were all equally good for enrichment of ammonifying bacteria. TABLE 10. Effect of the pH of the culture on enrichment of ammonifying bacteria populations from non-sterile ΜΒΜ1 and ΜΒΜ2. Culture pH was adjusted either in the beginning of the experiment or daily. Standard deviations of two biological replicate experiments and three technical replicate measurements of each sample are shown. ΜΒΜ1 ΜΒΜ2 pH adjusted in the beginning pH adjusted daily pH adjusted in the beginning pH adjusted daily pH 5 13.1 ± 1.1 1.1 ±0.7 38.3 ± 2.6 5.6 ±0.5 pH 6 26.6 ± 9.8 25.8 ± 5.9 38.0 ±5.6 36.6 ± 3.5 pH 7 37.1 ± 11.5 42.9 ±4.1 37.6 ± 2.0 47.9 ± 3.9 pH 8 67.4 ± 7.7 55.5 ± 4.6 44.4 ± 5.8 56.2 ±5.1 pH 9 71.3 ± 1.8 41.2 ±4.0 39.7 ±5.8 51.2 ± 1.7 pH 10 60.0 ± 7.4 11.1 ±0.5 41.3 ±5.9 9.0 ± 1.2 pH 11 51.7 ±4.7 0.9 ±0.1 45.6 ± 2.9 1.5 ± 0.2 pH 12 1.0 ± 0.2 1.3 ± 0.2 17.0 ± 1.0 1.5 ± 0.2 no pH adjustment 43.8 ± 12.9 42.0 ± 8.4 Conclusions. Mixed populations can be induced from meat-and-bone meals from two different manufacturers. Populations are induced at various temperatures, but optima vary between MBMs. If pH is maintained at below 6 or above 9, population induction is inhibited from both MBMs. EXAMPLE 6 PRE-TREATMENT OF PLANT-DERIVED MATERIALS FOR AMMONIFICATION WITH ASPERGILLUS ORYZAE Ammonification of carbohydrate-rich plant materials with mixed bacteria populations may cause acidification of the culture as described in Examples 2 and 3. In this experiment, plant materials were pre-treated with Aspergillus oryzae to decrease the acidifying effect of plant materials in ammonification. Rape cake, wheat briquettes, barley briquettes, barley mash, and food waste (containing mainly plant materials but also some meat) were first hydrolyzed with Aspergillus oryzae CECT 2095. Media containing 36 g rape cake or wheat briquettes and 90 ml tap water were prepared in Erlenmeyer flasks of 1 liter volume. Media containing 18 g barley briquettes and 45 ml tap water, 18 g barley mash and 20 ml tap water, or 32 g food waste and 43 ml tap water were prepared in Erlenmeyer flasks of 500 ml volume. Rape cake and wheat briquette media were either autoclaved at +121 °C to sterilize the media or left non-sterile. Barley media and food waste medium were left non-sterile. A. oryzae CECT 2095 was first cultivated on potato dextrose agar plate (300 g diced potatoes were boiled in 500 ml of water until thoroughly cooked, the liquid was filtered and water was added to 1000 ml; 20 g glucose and 15 g agar was added; the medium was autoclaved at +121 °C and poured on agar plates) for 3-7 days at room temperature. Then, A. oryzae was inoculated in potato dextrose liquid medium (prepared as potato dextrose agar but without agar) and cultivated at room temperature with gentle shaking for 3-5 days. 10 ml and 5 ml of the liquid culture was inoculated on the media in 1 liter and 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks, respectively. The final concentration of the media were as follows: rape cake, wheat briquettes, and barley briquettes 360 g/1, barley mash 720 g/1, and food waste 400 g/1. All the cultures were incubated at +30 °C for 14 days. Then, the cultures were weighed and water was added in the cultures as much as water was evaporated from the cultures during cultivation. The media hydrolyzed with A. oryzae were ammonified using mixed bacteria population SI. First, tap water was added on the cultures to get media with concentrations of 90 g plant material per liter of water. Food waste media were kept in the original 40 % concentration. A 5 % (ν/ν) SI incouclum was was added in 40 or 60 ml of the media, and the cultures were incubated at +50 °C for 7 days, and the ammonium production in the cultures was determined using an enzymatic determination kit for ammonia (Ammonia Assay Kit ΑΑ0100; Sigma-Aldrich). As a control, rape cake, wheat briquettes, barley briquettes, barley mash, and food waste were ammonified with SI population without any pretreatments. Media containing 180 g/1 wheat briquettes, rape cake, barley briquettes, or barley mash per liter of water and a 40 % suspension of food waste was prepared in tap water. A 5 % inoculum of SI population was added in 40 or 60 ml of the media, and the cultures were incubated at +50 °C for 7 days. pH’s of the cultures were either left unadjusted or then pH was adjusted daily (at days 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4) to neutral level using NaOH. Ammonium production of the cultures was determined using an enzymatic determination kit for ammonia (Ammonia Assay Kit ΑΑ0100; Sigma-Aldrich). Results. After 14 days pre-treatment with A. oryzae, pH of the cultures was 7-9. In all the non-pretreated plant media, the pH was acidic. Pre-treatment of plant-derived materials with A. oryzae increased ammonia yields 1.7-8-fold when compared to the non-pre-treated plant materials (TABLE 11). A similar increase in ammonium production was obtained with daily adjustment of the culture pH with NaOH. Thus, the pre-treatment of plant materials with A. oryzae is an alternative means to overcome the acidifying effect of carbohydrate-rich plant materials in ammonification. Plant materials can be either sterilized before the A. oryzae pre-treatment, or left non-sterile. TABLE 11. Ammonium production of SI population on different plant materials with or without daily pH adjustment (non-sterile media were used) or with 14 days pre-treatment with A. oryzae (the media were either non-sterile or sterilized before inoculation of A. oryzae). Ammonium production is represented as percentage of Ν converted to nitrogen in 7 days. The results are averages of two biological replicate experiments and three replicate measurements of each sample. In the experiment with A. oryzae, two biological replicate A. oryzae cultivations and two biological replicate SI cultivations were made. no pH adjustment pH adjusted pre-treatment with A. oryzae (non-sterile) pre-treatment with A. oryzae (sterile) Barley briquet 28.2 ±3.1% 68.3 ± 10.1% 47.5 ± 9.8% Barley mash 14.5 ± 1.6% 72.9 ± 8.4% 73.1 ± 11.4% Rape cake 7.2 ± 1.5% 42.4 ± 10.1% 58.2 ± 4.4% 52.8 ± 7.1% Wheat 5.5 ± 0.6% 55.0 ± 6.6% 21.7 ± 4.2% 32.4 ± 2.8% Food 8.6 ± 0.7% 44.9 ± 9.7% 67.4 ± 8.0% EXAMPLE 7 INNATE POPULATIONS AND INOCULATED MEAT-AND-BONE MEAL-DERIVED POPULATIONS AS AMMONIFYING COMMUNITIES Bacterial community analysis of innate populations of broiler chicken by-product (CBP-M), porcine/bovine by-product (ΡΒ-Μ), chicken feather (FE-M), fish by-product (MF-M) and crushed porcine/bovine bone (CB-M) was performed on DNA obtained by phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extraction from cultures where cells had been disrupted by bead beating. Cultured populations were raised and harvested from 20 % (weight/volume) materials incubated at 50 °C for four days (FE for 8 days). Bacterial 16S gene assay by tag-encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing (bTEFAP) and bacterial diversity data analysis were performed by the Research and Testing Lab (Lubbock, Texas, USA) as described by Dowd et αℓ. 2008a and Wolcott et αℓ. 2009. Primers 28F ‘GAGTTTGATCNTGGCTCAG’ (SEQ ID NO: 1) and 519R ‘GTNTTACNGCGGCKGCTG’ (SEQ ID NO: 2) were used for amplification of 16S variable regions VI-3. Results. Bacterial diversity analysis of innate and inoculated communities revealed the presence of bacteria belonging to 58 different genera (TABLE 12). Of the total of 115 results, 79 were identified at the species level and 36 at the genus level. TABLE 13 presents the predominant bacterial genera and species in each population. Bacteria belonging to 5-9 different genera form the majority of the populations. Clostridium spp. and Sporanaerobacter acetigenes are predominant in populations derived from materials inoculated with SI as well as innate populations of ΡΒ-Μ and MF-M. The other three innate populations showed more variety: CBP-M consisted predominantly of Enterococcus spp. and Pediococcus spp., FE-M population of Petrobacter succinatimandens, Soehngenia saccharolytica, Tissierella sp., and Clostridium spp., and CB-M population of Leptothrix sp. and Schlegelella spp. Correlation coefficients (TABLE 14) were calculated from data presented in TABLE 12 using equation [1], where A and Υ refer to two matrices, e.g. CBP-M and CBP, between which the correlation is calculated, χ and y are single values within a matrix, and χ and y are the means of all values within a matrix. Species not present in the population (empty cells in TABLE 12) were assigned a value 0. Correl(X,Y) = Σ (x-x)(y-y) [1] Vl(*-*)2Z(y-y)2 TABLE 14 reveals a high similarity between populations in all five inoculated materials and innate populations ΡΒ-Μ and MF-M. The remaining innate populations CBP-M, FE-M, and CB-M show low similarity mutually as well as to other populations. As stated above based on results of TABLE 3, SI outcompetes innate populations present in animal-origin materials. However, a population similar to SI can arise in animal-origin materials (ΡΒ-Μ and MF-M) under the conditions used. This is likely, since meat-and-bone meal, the source of SI and other efficiently ammonifying populations Al, Cl, HI, and PI (see EXAMPLE 5), is manufactured from slaughter by-products of various animal species. However, comparison of innate and inoculated populations of CBP, FE, and CB shows the bacterial community can evolve to a different composition under similar conditions. TABLE 14 also indicates ammonium yield i.e. the percentage of nitrogen in the animal-origin material converted to ammonia at the moment of harvesting the population for DNA extraction. The yields correlate with similarity of the innate population to inoculated population. Yields of 40 % or above are reached only when the correlation coefficient is above 0.9, and preferably above 0.95. TABLE 12. Bacterial diversity analysis results: genera and species in populations innate to animal-origin materials: broiler chicken by-product (CBP-M), porcine/bovine by-product (ΡΒ-Μ), chicken feather (FE-M), fish by-product (MF-M) and crushed porcine/bovine bone (CB-M). Diversity analysis was also performed on the same materials inoculated with 5 % (volume/volume) meat-and-bone meal-derived population SI. These results are labeled CBP, ΡΒ, FE, MF or CB, and are the same presented in TABLE 1. The results are expressed as percentage of total population.

FOl and FI1 populations were created by mixing non-sterile forest (FO) or field (FI) soil with cold tap water in a proportion of 180 g soil per liter of water. The mixture was cultured without aeration at 50 °C. F02 and FI2 populations were created by mixing non-sterile forest (FO) or field (FI) soil with boiling tap water in a proportion of 180 g of soil per liter of water. The mixture was let cool to room temperature. All mixtures were incubated without aeration at 50 °C. After 7 days incubation, 5 ml of each culture was inoculated in 100 ml of sterile ΜΒΜ1 medium containing 180 g of ΜΒΜ1 per liter of water. The cultures were incubated at 50 °C for 7 days. Bacterial community analysis of soil populations was performed on DNA obtained by phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extraction from cultures where cells had been disrupted by bead beating. Bacterial 16S gene assay by tag-encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing (bTEFAP) and bacterial diversity data analysis were performed by the Research and Testing Lab (Lubbock, Texas, USA) as described by Dowd et αℓ. 2008a and Wolcott et αℓ. 2009. Primers 28F ‘GAGTTTGATCNTGGCTCAG’ (SEQ ID NO: 1) and 519R ‘GTNTTACNGCGGCKGCTG’ (SEQ ID NO: 2) were used for amplification of 16S variable regions VI-3. Results. Bacterial diversity analysis of soil- and MBM-derived populations revealed the presence of bacteria belonging to 45 different genera (TABLE 15). Of the total of 85 results, 66 were identified at the species level and 19 at the genus level. TABLE 16 presents the predominant bacterial genera and species in each population. Bacteria belonging to 6-7 different genera form the majority of the populations. Clostridium spp. and Sporanaerobacter acetigenes are predominant in MBM-derived populations well as FOl and FI1. The other two soil populations showed more variety: F02 consisted predominantly of Bacillus spp., Thermoanaerobacterium spp., and Clostridium spp., and FI2 of Clostridium spp., Tissierella sp., and Caloramator sp. Correlation coefficients (TABLE 17) were calculated from data presented in TABLE 15 using equation [1], where X and Υ refer to two matrices, e.g. Α1 and Cl, between which the correlation is calculated, χ and y are single values within a matrix, and χ and y are the means of all values within a matrix. Species not present in the population (empty cells in TABLE 15) were assigned a value 0. Correl(X,Y) = Σ ( x-x)(y-y ) 7ΣΟ-χ)2 Z(y-y)2 [1] TABLE 17 shows a high similarity (correlation coefficient >0.9) between all five MBM-derived populations, as well as soil populations FOl and FI1. Therefore, populations similar to MBM-derived populations can arise from soil. Correlation coefficients of F02 and FI2 are below 0.2, indicating low similarity. Therefore, dissolving soil in boiling water is lethal to bacteria important to ammonification. TABLE 17 also indicates ammonium yield Le. the percentage of nitrogen in ΜΒΜ converted to ammonia at the moment of harvesting the population for DNA extraction. The yields correlate with similarity of the innate population to inoculated population. Yields of 40 % or above are reached only when the correlation coefficient is above 0.9. TABLE 15.

Excessive ammonia production is a major nutritional inefficiency in ruminants. The majority of amino acid catabolizing and therefore ammonia-producing activity of rumen has been attributed to certain microbes termed hyper ammonia-producing bacteria (ΗΑΒ) (Russell et al. 1988; Chen and Russell 1989; Krause and Russell 1996, Eschenlauer et al. 2002). Therefore, rumen can be a source of efficiently ammonifying bacteria. Enrichment of an ammonifying population was attempted by successive rounds of culturing bovine rumen bacteria in sterile ΜΒΜ1. Bovine rumen content was obtained from a fistulated cow, and filtered to separate liquid from solids. The liquid was added to sterile ΜΒΜ1 medium [180 g meat-and-bone meal 1 per liter of water] as a 25 % (volume/volume) inoculum, and cultured without aeration at 37 °C. Each enrichment cycle lasted 7 days to allow the ammonification reaction to reach full extent. Results. Ammonia yield i.e. the percentage of nitrogen converted to ammonia increased from 12.3 % ± 6.6 % to 24.7 % ± 3.1 % during the first three enrichment cycles, but then remained at the same level during the following four cycles. As shown in FIG. 1 in EXAMPLE 1, MBM-derived populations produce higher ammonia yields ranging from 37.9 % ± 2.3 % to 58.8 % ± 13.9 % at 37 °C. Therefore, despite of enrichment, the rumen population remained less efficient in ammonification than MBM-derived populations. The enriched rumen populations were not subjected to community diversity analysis. Fouts et al. (2012) report in their study of ruminal populations of twelve cows that eighty percent of bacteria identified to species level were belonged to orders Clostridiales, Bacteroidales, Erysipelotrichales and unclassified ΤΜ7. This composition differs from the composition of MBM-derived populations Al, Cl, HI, PI, and SI (TABLE 2), 94-98 % of which consist of bacteria belonging to order Clostridiales (genera Caloramator, Clostridium, Sporanaerobacter, Garciella and Tissierella). DISCUSSION Based on the experiments, it is clear that ammonification using defined mixed populations results in superior yields compared to prior art. Using the populations described above, ammonia concentrations up to 12 g/1 have been achieved, depending on the protein content of the starting material/medium used. This is 15-30 times improvement on ammonification yields in comparison with the prior art. Typically, 50-80 percent of the total nitrogen in the media was found to be converted to ammonia within 24-48 hours. An example environment 100 of an ammonification process of slaughterhouse by-products / waste is shown in FIG. 6. The organic material (by-products) is stored in a container 106. The waste in the container 106 is fed to a bioreactor 104. Water is added to the bioreactor 104 from a water source 102. Inoculum is added to the bioreactor 104 from a source 116. The type of inoculum is selected from group of HI, Cl, PI, SI and Al. Preferably inoculum is from mixed population of SI. The bioreactor can have mixing / stirring means 105 and heating/temperature controlling means 110. According to embodiments heating element 110 is used to heat content of the bioreactor 104 to about 50 degrees of Celsius (40-55 degrees of Celsius for the population SI). If needed, pH can be controlled by adding base (such as NaOH) to the bioreactor 104 to keep pH in levels of over 6. Fermentation time is preferably about 16-48 hours. During the fermentation process using a mixed bacterial population ammonium /ammonia is released to the fermentation liquid. Samples of the liquid from the bioreactor 104 can be taken from time to time to follow the progress of the process. A parameter to follow is the ammonia/ammonium concentration within the liquid. For example, in certain embodiments of the invention, the fermentation process is complete or sufficient when the change of the concentration ammonia/ammonium between two consecutive samples does not demonstrate a significant increase. All or some of the liquid from the bioreactor 104 can be led to stripping phase 108 where ammonium/ammonia is extracted as ammonia (ΝΗ3) from the liquid. The ammonia can be stored in a container 112 for future use such as a part of fertilizer production. Alternatively some or all of the liquid can be led to container 113 and used directly as fertilizer. After removing all or some of the liquid the remaining solids and/or liquids can be collected in storage 114 for future use. Some of the material in 114 can be also fed back to bioreactor 104 and used as inoculum for next batch. Additionally some of the liquids and/or solids can be left in the bioreactor 104 to form basis for next batch. Ammonification of plant materials with high carbohydrate contents might be inhibited by acidification of the medium during the fermentation process. Acidification of media can be avoided with addition of base (such as NaOH) in the culture. Also if plant and animal materials are mixed in appropriate proportions, acidification can be avoided and higher ammonia yields are achieved. Ammonification of different proteinacious materials can be optimized by selection of appropriate mixed bacteria population. As represented in TABLE 3, ammonification efficiency of each material is dependent on the bacteria population used. E.g. porcine/bovine by-products are ammonified most efficiently using population HI, whereas fish by-products are ammonified most efficiently using the SI population. On average, populations HI and SI are the most efficient ammonifiers on all the different proteinacious materials, and either HI or SI could also be selected as a population to be used on ammonification of any material. SI and other MBM-derived populations are efficient in ammonification of various animal-origin materials. Some of these materials can give rise to efficiently ammonifying innate populations when incubated under similar conditions used for creating the MBM-derived populations. However, all animal-origin materials do not possess an ammonifying population. Rumen is a well-known source of hyper-ammonia-producing bacterial species, but enrichment of a mixed population capable of ammonification with similar efficiency to MBM-derived populations was not possible. Soil samples also gave rise to efficient and inefficient ammonifying populations depending on the conditions used. Temperatures from 30°C to 60°C, more exactly 37-55°C and pH 5-11, more exactly pH 6-9, were the best for bacterial ammonification with the populations described here. In particular, inoculating organic material with bacterial population substantially similar to SI results in good ammonification yields. In addition or alternatively, contacting organic material with bacterial population consisting by 53-91% of total population of Sporanaerobacter acetigenes and by 8-34% of Clostridium spp. results in good ammonification yields. Ammonification works in anaerobic, microaerobic, and aerobic conditions using the mixed populations.
