Sodium arsenite induces cyclooxygenase-2 expression in human uroepithelial cells through MAPK pathway activation and reactive oxygen species induction.
Arsenic can induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to oxidative stress and carcinogenesis.
Bladder is one of the major target organs of arsenic, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) may play an important role in arsenic-induced bladder cancer.
However, the mechanism by which arsenic induces COX-2 in bladder cells remains unclear.
This study aimed at investigating arsenic-mediated intracellular redox status and signaling cascades leading to COX-2 induction in human uroepithelial cells (SV-HUC-1).
SV-HUC-1 cells were exposed to sodium arsenite and COX-2 expression, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation, glutathione (GSH) levels, ROS induction and Nrf2 expression were quantified.
Our results demonstrate that arsenite (1-10 μM) elevates COX-2 expression, GSH levels, ROS and Nrf2 expression.
Arsenite treatment for 24h stimulates phosphorylation of ERK and p38, but not JNK in SV-HUC-1 cells.
Induction of Cox-2 mRNA levels by arsenite was attenuated by inhibitors of ERK, p38 and JNK.
Arsenite-induced ROS generation and COX-2 expression were significantly attenuated by treatment with melatonin (a ROS scavenger), but enhanced by DL-buthionine-(S, R)-sulfoximine (BSO, an inhibitor of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS) resulting in lower GSH and increased ROS levels).
These data indicate that arsenite promotes an induction of ROS, which results in an induction of COX-2 expression through activation of the MAPK pathway.
