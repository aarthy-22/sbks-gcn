Impact of model perfume molecules on the self-assembly of anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl 6-benzene sulfonate.
The impact of two model perfumes with differing degrees of hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, linalool (LL) and phenylethanol (PE), on the solution structure of anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl 6-benzene sulfonate, LAS-6, has been studied by small angle neutron scattering, SANS.
For both types of perfume molecules, complex phase behavior is observed.
The phase behavior depends upon the concentration, surfactant/perfume composition, and type of perfume.
The more hydrophilic perfume PE promotes the formation of more highly curved structures.
At relatively low surfactant concentrations, small globular micelles, L1, are formed.
These become perfume droplets, L(sm), stabilized by the surfactant at much higher perfume solution compositions.
At higher surfactant concentrations, the tendency of LAS-6 to form more planar structures is evident.
The more hydrophobic linalool promotes the formation of more planar structures.
Combined with the greater tendency of LAS-6 to form planar structures, this results in the planar structures dominating the phase behavior for the LAS-6/linalool mixtures.
For the LAS-6/linalool mixture, the self-assembly is in the form of micelles only at the lowest surfactant and perfume concentrations.
Over most of the concentration-composition space explored, the structures are predominantly lamellar, L(α), or vesicle, L(v), or in the form of a lamellar/micellar coexistence.
At low and intermediate amounts of LL, a significantly different structure is observed, and the aggregates are in the form of small, relatively monodisperse vesicles (i.e., nanovesicles), L(sv).
