Role of the phytoestrogenic, pro-apoptotic and anti-oxidative properties of silymarin in inhibiting experimental benign prostatic hyperplasia in rats.
Androgen and estrogen play an important role in the pathogenesis of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).
Estrogen exerts its action through two distinct estrogen receptors (ERs) either ER-α or ER-β.
The phytoestrogenic property of silymarin (SIL) has been previously characterized.
Thus, this study examined the protective effect of SIL against testosterone-induced BPH in rats.
In an initial dose-response study, SIL in a dose of 50mg/kg was the most effective in preventing the rise in prostate weight, prostate weight/body weight ratio and histopathologic changes induced by testosterone.
Testosterone significantly decreased ER-β and increased ER-α and AR expressions as compared to the control group and these effects were significantly ameliorated by SIL.
Furthermore, SIL significantly protected against testosterone-provoked decline in mRNA expression of P21(WAF1/Cip1) and Bax/Bcl-xl ratio as well as caspase-3 activity.
SIL minimized the number of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) positive cells as compared to testosterone-treated group.
Moreover, SIL significantly blunted the inducible NF-κB expression and restored the oxidative status to within normal values in the prostatic tissues.
Collectively these findings elucidate the effectiveness of SIL in preventing testosterone-induced BPH in rats.
This could be attributed, at least partly, to its phytoestrogenic, pro-apoptotic and anti-oxidative properties.
