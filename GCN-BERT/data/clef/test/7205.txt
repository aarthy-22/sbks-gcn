According to the present invention the term "polymer" comprises polymers as well as oligomers, wherein a polymer is a molecule of high relative molecular mass, the structure of which essentially comprises the repetition of units derived, actually or conceptually, from molecules of low relative molecular mass and an oligomer is a molecule of intermediate molecular mass, the structure of which essentially comprises a small plurality of units derived, actually or conceptually, from molecules of lower relative molecular mass. A molecule is regarded as having a high relative molecular mass if it has properties which do not vary significantly with the removal of one or a few of the units. A molecule is regarded as having an intermediate molecular mass if it has properties which do vary significantly with the removal of one or a few of the units. According to the present invention a homopolymer is a polymer derived from one species of (real, implicit, or hypothetical) monomer. Many polymers are made by the mutual reaction of complementary monomers. These monomers can readily be visualized as reacting to give an "implicit monomer", the homopolymerisation of which would give the actual product, which can be regarded as a homopolymer. Some polymers are obtained by chemical modification of other polymers, such that the structure of the macromolecules that constitute the resulting polymer can be thought of having been formed by the homopolymerisation of a hypothetical monomer. Accordingly a copolymer is a polymer derived from more than one species of monomer, e.g. bipolymer, terpolymer, quaterpolymer, etc. The oligomers of this invention have a weight average molecular weight of < 2,000 Daltons. The polymers of this invention preferably have a weight average molecular weight of 2,000 Daltons or greater, especially 2,000 to 2,000,000 Daltons, more preferably 10,000 to 1,000,000 and most preferably 10,000 to 750,000 Daltons.

In said aspect the polymer comprises preferably one of the repeating units of formula Ia to Ii, wherein repeating units of the formula Ie, Id, Ih and Ii are especially preferred. Copolymers of formula VII, involving repeating units of formula I and COM1 or COM2 (v = 0.995 to 0.005, w = 0.005 to 0.995), can also be obtained by coupling reactions, such as nickel coupling reactions: wherein A is as defined above and -COM1- is selected from repeating units of formula: wherein R7 and R7' are as defined above,R44 and R41 are hydrogen, C1-C18alkyl, or C1-C18alkoxy, andR45 is H, C1-C18alkyl, or C1-C18alkyl which is substituted by E and/or interrupted by D, especially C1-C18alkyl which is interrupted by -0-, wherein D and E are as defined above, and -COM2- is a group of formula wherein R116 and R117 are independently of each other H, C1-C18alkyl, which can optionally be interrupted by O, or C1-C18alkoxy, which can optionally be interrupted by O,R119 and R120 are independently of each other H, C1-C18alkyl, which can optionally be interrupted by O, orR119 and R120 together form a group of formula =CR100R101, whereinR100 and R101 are independently of each other H, C1-C18alkyl, orR119 and R120 together form a five or six membered ring, which optionally can be substituted by C1-C18alkyl. In said embodiment the polymer is a polymer of formula wherein A, COM1 and COM2 are as defined above,o is 1,p is 0, or 1,q is 0.005 to 1,r is 0, or 1,s is 0, or 1, wherein e is not 1, if d is 0,t is 0.995 to 0, wherein the sum of c and f is 1. Homopolymers of formula VII are, for example, obtained by nickel coupling reactions, especially the Yamamoto reaction: wherein A is a repeating unit of formula I. Polymerization processes involving only dihalo-functional reactants may be carried out using nickel coupling reactions. One such coupling reaction was described by Colon et al. in J. Pol. Sci., Part A, Polymer Chemistry Edition 28 (1990) 367, and by Colon et al. in J. Org. Chem. 51 (1986) 2627. The reaction is typically conducted in a polar aprotic solvent (e.g., dimethylacetamide) with a catalytic amount of nickel salt, a substantial amount of triphenylphosphine and a large excess of zinc dust. A variant of this process is described by loyda et al. in Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn, 63 (1990) 80 wherein an organo-soluble iodide was used as an accelerator. Another nickel-coupling reaction was disclosed by Yamamoto in Progress in Polymer Science 17 (1992) 1153 wherein a mixture of dihaloaromatic compounds were treated with an excess amount of nickel (1,5-cyclooctadiene) complex in an inert solvent. All nickel-coupling reactions when applied to reactant mixtures of two or more aromatic dihalides yield essentially random copolymers. Such polymerization reactions may be terminated by the addition of small amounts of water to the polymerization reaction mixture, which will replace the terminal halogen groups with hydrogen groups. Alternatively, a monofunctional aryl halide may be used as a chain-terminator in such reactions, which will result in the formation of a terminal aryl group. Nickel-coupling polymerizations yield essentially homopolymers or random copolymers comprising DPP group-containing units and units derived from other co-monomers. Homopolymers of formula VIId, or VIIe can be obtained, for example, by the Suzuki reaction: wherein A, COM1 and COM2 are as defined above. Examples of preferred homopolymers of formula VIId, or VIIe are shown below: and The condensation reaction of an aromatic boronate and a halogenide, especially a bromide, commonly referred to as the "Suzuki reaction", is tolerant of the presence of a variety of organic functional groups as reported by N. Miyaura and A. Suzuki in Chemical Reviews, Vol. 95, pp. 457-2483 (1995). Preferred catalysts are 2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2',6'-di-alkoxybiphenyl/palladium(II)acetates. An especially preferred catalyst is 2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2',6'-di-methoxybiphenyl (sPhos)/palladium(II)acetate. This reaction can be applied to preparing high molecular weight polymers and copolymers. To prepare polymers corresponding to formula VIId, or VIIe a dihalogenide, such as a dibromide or dichloride, especially a dibromide corresponding to formula Br-A-Br is reacted with an equimolar amount of a diboronic acid or diboronate corresponding to formula wherein X11 is independently in each occurrence -B(OH)2, -B(OY1)2 or wherein Y1 is independently in each occurrence a C1-C10alkyl group and Y2 is independently in each occurrence a C2-C10alkylene group, such as -CY3Y4-CY5Y6-, or -CY7Y8-CY9Y10- CY11Y12-, wherein Y3, Y4, Y5, Y6, Y7, Y8, Y9, Y10, Y11 and Y12 are independently of each other hydrogen, or a C1-C10alkyl group, especially -C(CH3)2C(CH3)2-, or -C(CH3)2CH2C(CH3)2-, under the catalytic action of Pd and triphenylphosphine. The reaction is typically conducted at about 70 °C to 180 °C in an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent such as toluene. Other solvents such as dimethylformamide and tetrahydrofuran can also be used alone, or in mixtures with an aromatic hydrocarbon. An aqueous base, preferably sodium carbonate or bicarbonate, is used as the HBr scavenger. Depending on the reactivities of the reactants, a polymerization reaction may take 2 to 100 hours. Organic bases, such as, for example, tetraalkylammonium hydroxide, and phase transfer catalysts, such as, for example TBAB, can promote the activity of the boron (see, for example, Leadbeater & Marco; Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Eng. 42 (2003) 1407 and references cited therein). Other variations of reaction conditions are given by T. I. Wallow and B. M. Novak in J. Org. Chem. 59 (1994) 5034-5037; and M. Remmers, M. Schulze, and G. Wegner in Macromol. Rapid Commun. 17 (1996) 239-252. If desired, a monofunctional aryl halide or aryl boronate may be used as a chain-terminator in such reactions, which will result in the formation of a terminal aryl group. It is possible to control the sequencing of the monomeric units in the resulting copolymer by controlling the order and composition of monomer feeds in the Suzuki reaction. The polymers of the present invention can also be sythesized by the Stille coupling (see, for example, Babudri et al, J. Mater. Chem., 2004, 14, 11-34; J. K. Stille, Angew. Chemie Int. Ed. Engl. 1986, 25, 508). To prepare polymers corresponding to formula VIId, or VIIe a dihalogenide, such as a dibromide or dichloride, especially a dibromide corresponding to formula Br-A-Br is reacted with a compound of formula or wherein X11 is a group -SnR207R208 R209, in an inert solvent at a temperature in range from 0°C to 200°C in the presence of a palladium-containing catalyst. It must be ensured here that the totality of all monomers used has a highly balanced ratio of organotin functions to halogen functions. In addition, it may prove advantageous to remove any excess reactive groups at the end of the reaction by end-capping with monofunctional reagents. In order to carry out the process, the tin compounds and the halogen compounds are preferably introduced into one or more inert organic solvents and stirred at a temperature of from 0 to 200°C, preferably from 30 to 170°C for a period of from 1 hour to 200 hours, preferably from 5 hours to 150 hours. The crude product can be purified by methods known to the person skilled in the art and appropriate for the respective polymer, for example repeated reprecipitation or even by dialysis. Suitable organic solvents for the process described are, for example, ethers, for example diethyl ether, dimethoxyethane, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dioxolane, diisopropyl ether and tert-butyl methyl ether, hydrocarbons, for example hexane, isohexane, heptane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene and xylene, alcohols, for example methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, ethylene glycol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol and tert-butanol, ketones, for example acetone, ethyl methyl ketone and isobutyl methyl ketone, amides, for example dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylacetamide and N-methylpyrrolidone, nitriles, for example acetonitrile, propionitrile and butyronitrile, and mixtures thereof. The palladium and phosphine components should be selected analogously to the description for the Suzuki variant. Alternatively, the polymers of the present invention can also be synthesized by the Negishi reaction using zinc reagents (A-(ZnX12)2, wherein X12 is halogen) and halides or triflates (COM1-(X11)2, wherein X11 is halogen or triflate). Reference is, for example, made to E. Negishi et al., Heterocycles 18 (1982) 117-22. In addition, halogen derivatives of the DPPs can be polymerized oxidatively (for example using FeCl3, see, inter alia, P. Kovacic et al., Chem. Ber. 87 (1987) 357 to 379; M. Wenda et al., Macromolecules 25 (1992) 5125) or electrochemically (see, inter alia, N. Saito et al., Polym. Bull. 30 (1993) 285). The monomers of the formula and are new and form a further aspect of the present invention, Wherein B and C are independently of each other an optionally condensed aromatic, or heteroaromatic ring, a, b, c, d, e, f, Ar1, Ar1', Ar2, Ar2, Ar3, Ar3', Ar4 and Ar4' are as defined in claim 1 and X is ZnX12, -SnR207R208R209, wherein R207, R208 and R209 are identical or different and are H or C1-C6alkyl, wherein two radicals optionally form a common ring and these radicals are optionally branched or unbranched and X12 is a halogen atom, very especially I, or Br; or -OS(O)2CF3,-OS(O)2-aryl, especially OS(O)2CH3, -B(OH)2, -B(OY1)2, BF4Na, or -BF4K, wherein Y1 is independently in each occurrence a C1-C10alkyl group and Y2 is independently in each occurrence a C2-C10alkylene group, such as -CY3Y4-CY5Y6-, or-CY7Y8-CY9Y10- CY11Y12-, wherein Y3 Y4, Y5, Y6, Y7, Y8, Y9, Y10, Y11 and Y12 are independently of each other hydrogen, or a C1-C10alkyl group, especially -C(CH3)2C(CH3)2-, or -C(CH3)2CH2C(CH3)2-, with the proviso that, if Ar1 and Ar1' are a group of formula a and d are not 0. A further aspect of the invention relates to both the oxidised and reduced form of the polymers and materials according to this invention. Either loss or gain of electrons results in formation of a highly delocalised ionic form, which is of high conductivity. This can occur on exposure to common dopants. Suitable dopants and methods of doping are known to those skilled in the art, e. g., from EP0528662, US5,198,153, or WO 96/21659. The doping process typically implies treatment of the semiconductor material with an oxidating or reducing agent in a redox reaction to form delocalised ionic centres in the material, with the corresponding counterions derived from the applied dopants. Suitable doping methods comprise for example exposure to a doping vapor in the atmospheric pressure or at a reduced pressure, electrochemical doping in a solution containing a dopant, bringing a dopant into contact with the semiconductor material to be thermally diffused, and ion-implantantion of the dopant into the semiconductor material. When electrons are used as carriers, suitable dopants are for example halogens (e. g., I2, Cl2, Br2, ICI, ICl3, IBr and IF), Lewis acids (e.g., PF5, AsF5, SbF5, BF3, BCl3, SbCl5, BBr3 and SO3), protonic acids, organic acids, or amino acids (e. g., HF, HCl, HNO3,H2SO4, HClO4, FSO3H and ClSO3H), transition metal compounds (e.g.,FeCl3, FeOCl, Fe(ClO4)3, Fe(4-CH3C6H4SO3)3, TiCl4, ZrCl4, HfCl4, NbF5,NbCl5, TaCl5, MoF5,MoCl5, WF5, WCl6, UF6 and LnCl3 (wherein Ln is a lanthanoid), anions (e. g., Cl-, Br, I-, I3-, HSO4-, SO2-, NO3-, ClO4-,BF4-, PF6-, AsF6-, SbF6-, FeCl4-, Fe(CN)63-, anions of various sulfonic acids, such as aryl-SO3-). When holes are used as carriers, examples of dopants are cations (e.g., H+, Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+ and Cs+), alkali metals (e.g., Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs), alkaline-earth metals (e.g., Ca, Sr, and Ba), O2, XeOF4, (NO2+)(SbF6-), (NO2+) (SbCl6-), (NO2+) (BF4-), AgClO4, H2IrCl6, La(NO3)3·6 H2O, FSO2OOSO2F, Eu, acetylcholine, R4N+, (R is an alkyl group), R4P+ (R is an alkyl group), R6As+ (R is an alkyl group), and R3S+ (R is an alkyl group).

The polymers of the invention can be used as the semiconductor layer in semiconductor devices. Accordingly, the present invention also relates to semiconductor devices, comprising a polymer of the formula I. The semiconductor device is especially a diode, an organic field effect transistor and/or a solar cell, or a device containing a diode and/or an organic field effect transistor, and/or a solar cell. There are numerous types of semiconductor devices. Common to all is the presence of one or more semiconductor materials. Semiconductor devices have been described, for example, by S. M. Sze in Physics of Semiconductor Devices, 2nd edition, John Wiley and Sons, New York (1981). Such devices include rectifiers, transistors (of which there are many types, including p-n-p, n-p-n, and thin-film transistors), light emitting semiconductor devices (for example, organic light emitting diodes in display applications or backlight in e.g. liquid crystal displays), photoconductors, current limiters, solar cells, thermistors, p-n junctions, field-effect diodes, Schottky diodes, and so forth. In each semiconductor device, the semiconductor material is combined with one or more metals and/or insulators to form the device. Semiconductor devices can be prepared or manufactured by known methods such as, for example, those described by Peter Van Zant in Microchip Fabrication, Fourth Edition, McGraw-Hill, New York (2000). In particular, organic electronic components can be manufactured as described by D.R. Gamota et al. in Printed Organic and Molecular Electronics, Kluver Academic Publ., Boston, 2004. A particularly useful type of transistor device, the thin-film transistor (TFT), generally includes a gate electrode, a gate dielectric on the gate electrode, a source electrode and a drain electrode adjacent to the gate dielectric, and a semiconductor layer adjacent to the gate dielectric and adjacent to the source and drain electrodes (see, for example, S. M. Sze, Physics of Semiconductor Devices, 2.sup.nd edition, John Wiley and Sons, page 492, New York (1981)). These components can be assembled in a variety of configurations. More specifically, an organic thin-film transistor (OTFT) has an organic semiconductor layer. Typically, a substrate supports the OTFT during manufacturing, testing, and/or use. Optionally, the substrate can provide an electrical function for the OTFT. Useful substrate materials include organic and inorganic materials. For example, the substrate can comprise silicon materials inclusive of various appropriate forms of silicon, inorganic glasses, ceramic foils, polymeric materials (for example, acrylics, polyester, epoxies, polyamides, polycarbonates, polyimides, polyketones, poly(oxy-1,4-phenyleneoxy-1,4-phenylenecarbonyl-1,4-phenylene) (sometimes referred to as poly(ether ether ketone) or PEEK), polynorbornenes, polyphenyleneoxides, poly(ethylene naphthalenedicarboxylate) (PEN), poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), poly(phenylene sulfide) (PPS)), filled polymeric materials (for example, fiber-reinforced plastics (FRP)), and coated metallic foils. The gate electrode can be any useful conductive material. For example, the gate electrode can comprise doped silicon, or a metal, such as aluminum, chromium, gold, silver, nickel, palladium, platinum, tantalum, and titanium. Conductive oxides, such as indium tin oxide, or conducting inks/pastes comprised of carbon black/graphite or colloidal silver dispersions, optionally containing polymer binders can also be used. Conductive polymers also can be used, for example polyaniline or poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). In addition, alloys, combinations, and multilayers of these materials can be useful. In some OTFTs, the same material can provide the gate electrode function and also provide the support function of the substrate. For example, doped silicon can function as the gate electrode and support the OTFT. The gate dielectric is generally provided on the gate electrode. This gate dielectric electrically insulates the gate electrode from the balance of the OTFT device. Useful materials for the gate dielectric can comprise, for example, an inorganic electrically insulating material. The gate dielectric (insulator) can be a material, such as, an oxide, nitride, or it can be a material selected from the family of ferroelectric insulators (e.g. organic materials such as poly(vinylidene fluoride/trifluoroethylene or poly(m-xylylene adipamide)), or it can be an organic polymeric insulator (e.g. poly(methacrylate)s, poly(acrylate)s, polyimides, benzocyclobutenes (BCBs), parylenes, polyvinylalcohol, polyvinylphenol (PVP), polystyrenes, polyester, polycarbonates) as for example described in J. Veres et al. Chem. Mat. 2004, 16, 4543 or A. Facchetti et al. Adv. Mat. 2005, 17, 1705. Specific examples of materials useful for the gate dielectric include strontiates, tantalates, titanates, zirconates, aluminum oxides, silicon oxides, tantalum oxides, titanium oxides, silicon nitrides, barium titanate, barium strontium titanate, barium zirconate titanate, zinc selenide, and zinc sulphide, including but not limited to PbZrxTi1-xO3 (PZT), Bi4Ti3O12, BaMgF4, Ba(Zr1-xTix)O3 (BZT). In addition, alloys, hybride materials (e.g. polysiloxanes or nanoparticle-filled polymers) combinations, and multilayers of these materials can be used for the gate dielectric. The thickness of the dielectric layer is, for example, from about 10 to 1000 nm, with a more specific thickness being about 100 to 500 nm, providing a capacitance in the range of 0.1 - 100 nanofarads (nF). The source electrode and drain electrode are separated from the gate electrode by the gate dielectric, while the organic semiconductor layer can be over or under the source electrode and drain electrode. The source and drain electrodes can be any useful conductive material favourably providing a low resistance ohmic contact to the semiconductor layer. Useful materials include most of those materials described above for the gate electrode, for example, aluminum, barium, calcium, chromium, gold, silver, nickel, palladium, platinum, titanium, polyaniline, PEDOT:PSS, other conducting polymers, alloys thereof, combinations thereof, and multilayers thereof. Some of these materials are appropriate for use with n-type semiconductor materials and others are appropriate for use with p-type semiconductor materials, as is known in the art. The thin film electrodes (that is, the gate electrode, the source electrode, and the drain electrode) can be provided by any useful means such as physical vapor deposition (for example, thermal evaporation or sputtering) or (ink jet) printing methods. The patterning of these electrodes can be accomplished by known methods such as shadow masking, additive photolithography, subtractive photolithography, printing, microcontact printing, and pattern coating. The present invention further provides a thin film transistor device comprising a plurality of electrically conducting gate electrodes disposed on a substrate;a gate insulator layer disposed on said electrically conducting gate electrodes;a plurality of sets of electrically conductive source and drain electrodes disposed on said insulator layer such that each of said sets is in alignment with each of said gate electrodes; an organic semiconductor layer disposed in the channel between source and drain electrodes on said insulator layer substantially overlapping said gate electrodes; wherein said organic semiconductor layer comprise a polymer of the formula I, or a mixture containing a polymer of formula I. The present invention further provides a process for preparing a thin film transistor device comprising the steps of: depositing a plurality of electrically conducting gate electrodes on a substrate;depositing a gate insulator layer on said electrically conducting gate electrodes;depositing a plurality of sets of electrically conductive source and drain electrodes on said layer such that each of said sets is in alignment with each of said gate electrodes; depositing a layer of a polymer of the formula I on said insulator layer such that said layer of the compound of formula I, or a mixture containing a polymer of formula I, substantially overlaps said gate electrodes; thereby producing the thin film transistor device. A mixture containing a polymer of formula I results in a semi-conducting layer comprising a polymer of formula I (typically 5% to 99.9999% by weight, especially 20 to 85% by weight) and at least another material. The other material can be, but is not restricted to a fraction of the same polymer of formula I with different molecular weight, another polymer of formula I, a semi-conducting polymer, organic small molecules, carbon nanotubes, a fullerene derivative, inorganic particles (quantum dots, quantum rods, quantum tripods, TiO2, ZnO etc.), conductive particles (Au, Ag etc.), insulator materials like the ones described for the gate dielectric (PET, PS etc.). For heterojunction solar cells the active layer comprises preferably a mixture of a polymer of formula I and a fullerene, such as [60]PCBM (= 6,6-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester), or [70]PCBM, in a weight ratio of 1:1 to 1:3. Any suitable substrate can be used to prepare the thin films of the polymers of the present invention. Preferably, the substrate used to prepare the above thin films is a metal, silicon, plastic, paper, coated paper, fabric, glass or coated glass. Alternatively, a TFT is fabricated by, for example, by solution deposition of a polymer on a highly doped silicon substrate covered with a thermally grown oxide layer followed by vacuum deposition and patterning of source and drain electrodes. In yet another approach, a TFT is fabricated by deposition of source and drain electrodes on a highly doped silicon substrate covered with a thermally grown oxide and then solution deposition of the polymer to form a thin film. The gate electrode could also be a patterned metal gate electrode on a substrate or a conducting material such as, a conducting polymer, which is then coated with an insulator applied either by solution coating or by vacuum deposition on the patterned gate electrodes. Any suitable solvent can be used to dissolve, and/or disperse the polymers of the present application, provided it is inert and can be removed partly, or completely from the substrate by conventional drying means (e.g. application of heat, reduced pressure, airflow etc.). Suitable organic solvents for processing the semiconductors of the invention include, but are not limited to, aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbons, halogenated such as chlorinated or fluorinated hydrocarbons, esters, ethers amides, such as chloroform, tetrachloroethane, , tetrahydrofuran, toluene, tetraline, anisole, xylene, ethyl acetate, methyl ethyl ketone, dimethyl formamide, dichlorobenzene, trichlorobenzene, propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PGMEA) and mixtures thereof. The solution, and/or dispersion is then applied by a method, such as, spin-coating, dip-coating, screen printing, microcontact printing, doctor blading or other solution application techniques known in the art on the substrate to obtain thin films of the semiconducting material. The term "dispersion" covers any composition comprising the semiconductor material of the present invention, which is not fully dissolved in a solvent. The dispersion can be done selecting a composition including at least a polymer of formula I, or a mixture containing a polymer of formula I, and a solvent, wherein the polymer exhibits lower solubility in the solvent at room temperature but exhibits greater solubility in the solvent at an elevated temperature, wherein the composition gels when the elevated temperature is lowered to a first lower temperature without agitation; dissolving at the elevated temperature at least a portion of the polymer in the solvent; lowering the temperature of the composition from the elevated temperature to the first lower temperature; agitating the composition to disrupt any gelling, wherein the agitating commences at any time prior to, simultaneous with, or subsequent to the lowering the elevated temperature of the composition to the first lower temperature; depositing a layer of the composition wherein the composition is at a second lower temperature lower than the elevated temperature; and drying at least partially the layer. The dispersion can also be constituted of (a) a continuous phase comprising a solvent, a binder resin, and optionally a dispersing agent, and (b) a disperse phase comprising a polymer of formula I, or a mixture containing a polymer of formula I of the present invention. The degree of solubility of the polymer of formula I in the solvent may vary for example from 0% to about 20% solubility, particularly from 0% to about 5% solubility. Preferably, the thickness of the organic semiconductor layer is in the range of from about 5 to about 1000 nm, especially the thickness is in the range of from about 10 to about 100 nm. The polymers of the invention can be used alone or in combination as the organic semiconductor layer of the semiconductor device. The layer can be provided by any useful means, such as, for example, vapor deposition (for materials with relatively low molecular weight) and printing techniques. The compounds of the invention may be sufficiently soluble in organic solvents and can be solution deposited and patterned (for example, by spin coating, dip coating, ink jet printing, gravure printing, flexo printing, offset printing, screen printing, microcontact (wave)-printing, drop or zone casting, or other known techniques). The polymers of the invention can be used in integrated circuits comprising a plurality of OTFTs, as well as in various electronic articles. Such articles include, for example, radiofrequency identification (RFID) tags, backplanes for flexible displays (for use in, for example, personal computers, cell phones, or handheld devices), smart cards, memory devices, sensors (e.g. light-, image-, bio-, chemo-, mechanical- or temperature sensors), especially photodiodes, or security devices and the like. Due to its ambi-polarity the material can also be used in Organic Light Emitting Transistors (OLET). The invention provides organic photovoltaic (PV) devices (solar cells) comprising a polymer according to the present invention. The PV device comprise in this order: (a) a cathode (electrode),(b) optionally a transition layer, such as an alkali halogenide, especially lithium fluoride,(c) a photoactive layer,(d) optionally a smoothing layer,(e) an anode (electrode),(f) a substrate. The photoactive layer comprises the polymers of the present invention. Preferably, the photoactive layer is made of a conjugated polymer of the present invention, as an electron donor and an acceptor material, like a fullerene, particularly a functionalized fullerene PCBM, as an electron acceptor. The fullerenes useful in this invention may have a broad range of sizes (number of carbon atoms per molecule). The term fullerene as used herein includes various cage-like molecules of pure carbon, including Buckminsterfullerene (C60) and the related "spherical" fullerenes as well as carbon nanotubes. Fullerenes may be selected from those known in the art ranging from, for example, C20-C1000. Preferably, the fullerene is selected from the range of C60 to C96. Most preferably the fullerene is C60 or C70, such as [60]PCBM, or [70]PCBM. It is also permissible to utilize chemically modified fullerenes, provided that the modified fullerene retains acceptor-type and electron mobility characteristics. The acceptor material can also be a material selected from the group consisting of another polymer of formula I or any semi-conducting polymer provided that the polymers retain acceptor-type and electron mobility characteristics, organic small molecules, carbon nanotubes, inorganic particles (quantum dots, quantum rods, quantum tripods, TiO2, ZnO etc.). The electrodes are preferably composed of metals or "metal substitutes". Herein the term "metal" is used to embrace both materials composed of an elementally pure metal, e.g., Mg, and also metal alloys which are materials composed of two or more elementally pure metals, e.g., Mg and Ag together, denoted Mg:Ag. Here, the term "metal substitute" refers to a material that is not a metal within the normal definition, but which has the metal-like properties that are desired in certain appropriate applications. Commonly used metal substitutes for electrodes and charge transfer layers would include doped wide-bandgap semiconductors, for example, transparent conducting oxides such as indium tin oxide (ITO), gallium indium tin oxide (GITO), and zinc indium tin oxide (ZITO). Another suitable metal substitute is the transparent conductive polymer polyanaline (PANI) and its chemical relatives, or PEDOT:PSS. Metal substitutes may be further selected from a wide range of non-metallic materials, wherein the term "non-metallic" is meant to embrace a wide range of materials provided that the material is free of metal in its chemically uncombined form. Highly transparent, non-metallic, low resistance cathodes or highly efficient, low resistance metallic/non-metallic compound cathodes are, for example, disclosed in US-B-6,420,031 and US-B-5,703,436. The substrate can be, for example, a plastic (flexible substrate), or glass substrate. In another preferred embodiment of the invention, a smoothing layer is situated between the anode and the photoactive layer. A preferred material for this smoothing layer comprises a film of 3,4-polyethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT), or 3,4-polyethylenedioxythiophene:polystyrene-sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the photovoltaic cell comprises, as described for example, in US-B-6,933,436 a transparent glass carrier, onto which an electrode layer made of indium/tin oxide (ITO) is applied. This electrode layer generally has a comparatively rough surface structure, so that it is covered with a smoothing layer made of a polymer, typically PEDOT, which is made electrically conductive through doping. The photoactive layer is made of two components, has a layer thickness of, for example, 100 nm to a few µm depending on the application method, and is applied onto this smoothing layer. Photoactive layer is made of a conjugated polymer of the present invention, as an electron donor and a fullerene, particularly functionalized fullerene PCBM, as an electron acceptor. These two components are mixed with a solvent and applied as a solution onto the smoothing layer by, for example, the spin-coating method, the casting method, the Langmuir-Blodgett ("LB") method, the ink jet printing method and the dripping method. A squeegee or printing method could also be used to coat larger surfaces with such a photoactive layer. Instead of toluene, which is typical, a dispersion agent such as chlorobenzene is preferably used as a solvent. Among these methods, the vacuum deposition method, the spin-coating method, the ink jet printing method and the casting method are particularly preferred in view of ease of operation and cost. In the case of forming the layer by using the spin-coating method, the casting method and ink jet printing method, the coating can be carried out using a solution and/or dispersion prepared by dissolving, or dispersing the composition in a concentration of from 0.01 to 90% by weight in an appropriate organic solvent such as benzene, toluene, xylene, tetrahydrofurane, methyltetrahydrofurane, N,N-dimethylformamide, acetone, acetonitrile, anisole, dichloromethane, dimethylsulfoxide, chlorobenzene, 1,2-dichlorobenzene and mixtures thereof. Before a counter electrode is applied, a thin transition layer, which must be electrically insulating, having a layer thickness of, for example, 0.6 nm, is applied to photoactive layer 4. In this exemplary embodiment, this transition layer is made of an alkali halogenide, namely a lithium fluoride, which is vapor deposited in a vacuum of 2 · 10-6 torr at a rate of 0.2 nm/minute. If ITO is used as a hole-collecting electrode, aluminum, which is vapor deposited onto the electrically insulating transition layer, is used as an electron-collecting electrode. The electric insulation properties of the transition layer obviously prevent influences which hinder the crossing of the charge carrier from being effective, particularly in the transition region from the photoactive layer to the transition layer. In a further embodiment on the invention, one or more of the layers may be treated with plasma prior to depositing the next layer. It is particularly advantageous that the PEDOT:PSS layer be subject to a mild plasma treatment prior to deposition of the next layer. The photovoltaic (PV) device can also consist of multiple junction solar cells that are processed on top of each other in order to absorb more of the solar spectrum. Such structures are, for example, described in App. Phys. Let. 90, 143512 (2007), Adv. Funct. Mater. 16, 1897-1903 (2006) and WO2004/112161. A so called 'tandem solar cell' comprise in this order: (a) a cathode (electrode),(b) optionally a transition layer, such as an alkali halogenide, especially lithium fluoride,(c) a photoactive layer,(d) optionally a smoothing layer,(e) a middle electrode (such as Au, Al, ZnO, TiO2 etc.)(f) optionally an extra electrode to match the energy level,(g) optionally a transition layer, such as an alkali halogenide, especially lithium fluoride,(h) a photoactive layer,(i) optionally a smoothing layer,(j) an anode (electrode),(k) a substrate. The PV device can also be processed on a fiber as described, for example, in US20070079867 and US 20060013549. Due to their excellent self-organising properties the inventive compounds, materials or films can also be used alone or together with other materials in or as alignment layers in LCD or OLED devices, as described for example in US2003/0021913. The following examples are included for illustrative purposes only. Unless otherwise stated, all parts and percentages are by weight. Weight-average molecular weight (Mw) and polydispersity (Mw/Mn = PD) are determined by Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) [Apparatus: GPCmax + TDA 302 from Viscotek (Houston, TX, USA) yielding the responses form refractive index (RI), low angle light scattering (LALS), right angle light scattering (RALS) and differential viscosity (DP) measurements. Chromatographic conditions: Column: PLgel mixed C (300 x 7.5 mm, 5 µm particles) covering the molecular weight range from about 1 x 103 to about 2.5 x 106 Da from Polymer Laboratories (Church Stretton, UK); Mobile phase: tetrahydrofuran containing 5 g/l of sodium trifluoroacetate; Mobile phase flow: either 0.5 or 0.7 ml/min; Solute concentration: about 1-2 mg/ml; Injection volume: 100 µl; Detection: RI, LALS, RALS, DP. Procedure of molecular weight calibration:Relative calibration is done by use of a set of 10 polystyrene calibration standards obtained from Polymer Laboratories (Church Stretton, UK) spanning the molecular weight range from 1'930'000 Da - 5'050 Da, i. e., PS 1'930'000, PS 1'460'000, PS 1'075'000, PS 560'000, PS 330'000, PS 96'000, PS 52'000, PS 30'300, PS 10'100, PS 5'050 Da. Absolute calibration is done on the base of the responses of LALS, RALS and DP. As experienced in a large number of investigations this combination provides optimum calculation of molecular weight data. Usually PS 96'000 is used as the molecular weight calibration standard, but in general every other PS standard lying in the molecular weight range to be determined can be chosen for this purpose. All polymer structures given in the examples below are idealized representations of the polymer products obtained via the polymerization procedures described. If more than two components are copolymerized with each other sequences in the polymers can be either alternating or random depending on the polymerisation conditions. Examples Example 1 a) A solution of 4.5 g of DPP 1, 6.23 g of K2CO3 and 8.68 g of 1-bromo-2-ethyl-hexyl in 60 ml of N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP) is heated to 140°C for 6h. The mixture is washed with water and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic phase is then dried and filtered on a double layer of silica gel and Hyflo® (CAS 91053-39-3; Fluka 56678) before it is concentrated. The residue is dissolved in 100 ml of chloroform, cooled down to 0°C and 2 equivalents of N-bromosuccinimide are then added portion wise over a period of 1h. After the reaction has been completed, the mixture is washed with water. The organic phase is extracted, dried and concentrated. The compound is then purified over a silica gel column to give 1.90 g of a violet powder of DPP 2. b) A solution of 500 mg of the dibrominated DPP 2, 990 mg of the tin derivative and 85 mg of Pd(PPh3)4 in 30 ml of dry toluene is refluxed overnight under inert conditions. After cooling down, the mixture is filtrated on a double layer silica gel/Hyflo®, concentrated and precipitated with methanol. The precipitate is filtrated and rinsed with methanol to give 530 mg of a blue solid of DPP 3. c) A solution of 2.55 g of the corresponding monomer 3 in chlorobenzene is degassed with argon over 15 min at 50°C. Then 1.6 g of FeCl3 are added in nitromethane and the mixture is stirred while degassing for 4 hours at 50°C. The solution is then poured into methanol and the blue precipitate is then filtrated and washed with methanol. The solid is then purified by soxhlet extraction, using methanol and hexane to purify and chloroform to extract 2 g of the polymer fraction (4). Mw = 13301Fe content = 75 ppm Photophysical properties: UV spectra of spin coated films on glass substrates are made from hot chlorobenzene solutions and annealed at different temperatures: Annealing ConditionsUV/Vis-absorptionRoom temperature680 nm20 minutes at 100 °C720 nm, 800 nm20 minutes at 150 °C720 nm, 800 nm Growing of the band at 800 nm shows the appearance of strong aggregation behaviour while annealing. Application Example 1a - DPP-polymers based Field-Effect Transistors a) Experimental: Bottom-gate thin-film transistor (TFT) structures with p-Si gate were used for all experiments. A high-quality thermal SiO2 layer served as gate-insulator of Ci = 32.6 nF/cm2 capacitance per unit area. Source and drain electrodes were patterned by photolithography directly on the gate-oxide (bottom-contact configuration). On each substrate 16 transistors are present with Au source/drain electrodes defining channels of different length. Prior to the deposition of the organic semiconductor the SiO2 surface was derivatized with hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) or octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS). The films are prepared either by spin casting or drop casting the polymer obtained in example 1 in different solvents. The transistor behaviour is measured on an automated tester elaborated by CSEM, Transistor Prober TP-10. b) Transistor performance: The thin-film transistors showed clear p-type transistor behavior. From a linear fit to the square root of the saturated transfer characteristics a field-effect mobility of 0.15 cm2/Vs could be determined. The transistors showed a threshold voltage of about 0 V to 5 V. The transistors showed good on/off current ratios of 104 to 107. Annealing of the sample results in a drastic increase of the performances (especially mobility), which can be correlated to a better aggregation of the polymer in the solid state. Testing of a set of OFETs after 2 months exposed in air conditions shows remarkable stability as the mobility is almost constant. The on/off ratio, which usually suffers the most, is only reduced by a factor of 10. Application Example 1 b DPP-polymer based bulk heterojunction solar cell a) Experimental: The solar cell has the following structure: Al electrode/LiF layer/organic layer, including polymer of the invention/[poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene) (PEDOT)/ poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PSS)]/ITO electrode/glass substrate. The solar cells are made by spin-coating a layer of PEDOT-PSS on a pre-patterned ITO on glass substrate. Then a 1:4 mixture of the polymer of example 1 (0.5 % by weight) : [60]PCBM (a substituted C60 fullerene: is spin coated (organic layer). LiF and Al are sublimed under high vacuum through a shadow-mask. b) Solar cell performance: The solar cell is measured under a solar light simulator. Then with the External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) graph the current is estimated under AM1.5 conditions. This leads to value of Jsc = 4.1 mA/cm2, FF = 0.539 and Voc = 0.733 V for an estimated overall efficiency of 1.62 % measured before annealing. After 10 min at 100°C the estimated efficiency grows to 2 %. After optimisation of the morphology of the active layer by varying the deposition solvent, the polymer/[60]PCBM ratio etc. the performance of the device can be pushed up to 3.06 % (Jsc = 9.5mA/cm2, FF = 0.46 and Voc = 0.7 V). Example 2 A solution of 25 g of DPP 1, 46.07 g of K2CO3 and 75 g of 1-bromo-2-hexyl-decyl in 300 ml of N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP) is heated to 140°C for 6h. The mixture is washed with water and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic phase is then dried and filtered on a double layer of silica gel and Hyflo® before it is concentrated. The residue is dissolved in 100 ml of chloroform, cooled down to 0°C and 2 equivalents of N-bromosuccinimide are then added portion wise over a period of 1h.

The precipitate is filtrated and rinsed with methanol to give 10 g of a blue solid of DPP 7. In a shlenk tube, a solution of 240 mg of Ni(COD)2 and 140 mg bipyridine in 10 ml of toluene is degassed for 15 min. 1 g of the corresponding dibrominated monomer 7 is added to this solution and then the mixture is heated to 80°C and stirred vigorously overnight. The solution is poured on 100 ml of a 1/1/1 methanol / HCl / acetone mixture and stirred for 1h. The precipitate is then filtrated, dissolved in CHCl3 and stirred vigorously at 60°C with an aqueous solution of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tetrasodium salt for one additional hour. The organic phase is washed with water, concentrated and precipitated in methanol. The residue is purified by soxhlet extraction using methanol and hexane and the polymer is then extracted with CHCl3 to give 250 mg of purple fibres.

Testing of a set of OFETs after 7 days exposed in air conditions shows remarkable stability as the mobility is almost constant even better, on/off ratio which usually suffers the most is only reduced by a factor of 5. This compound shows an electron mobility up to 10-3 cm2/Vs on the normal setup. After optimisation of this setup using top contact transistors, the ambi-polarity of this polymer is even more pronounced with similar mobilites for holes and electrons up to 0.1 cm2/Vs.
