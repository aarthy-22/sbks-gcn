Effects of fenofibrate, a PPAR-α ligand, on the haemodynamics of glycerol-induced renal failure in rats.
The modulating effect of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α ligand on haemodynamic effects of phenylepherine (PE), angiotensin II (AII), endothelin 1 (ET1), acetylcholine (Ach), sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and isoproterenol (ISO) were evaluated in glycerol-induced acute kidney injury in rats.
The effect of PE on fenofibrate-treated animals was a dose-dependent increase in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP).
For AII and ET1, MAP was also increased for the fenofibrate group but not in a dose-dependent fashion.
On the medullary blood flow (MBF), while the lower doses of PE and AII increased the perfusion unit on the fenofibrate-treated group, the higher doses decreased the perfusion unit.
The ET1 increased the perfusion unit on this group but not in dose-dependent fashion.
The effects of PE and AII on the cortical blood flow (CBF) of fenofibrate-treated group is similar to that of MBF for the same group but not for ET1.
The effect of Ach, SNP and ISO in all the groups was the decrease in MAP.
ISO caused dose-dependent increase in MBF of fenofibrate-treated group.
The effect of Ach, SNP and ISO on the CBF perfusion unit was that of the increase for the fenofibrate-treated group.
The study showed that fenofibrate did not attenuate increased blood pressure induced by PE, AII and ET1 but caused enhanced vasodilation by Ach, SNP and ISO.
