D-glucose stimulation of L-arginine transport and nitric oxide synthesis results from activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases p42/44 and Smad2 requiring functional type II TGF-beta receptors in human umbilical vein endothelium.
Elevated extracellular D-glucose increases transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) release from human umbilical vein endothelium (HUVEC).
TGF-beta1, via TGF-beta receptors I (TbetaRI) and TbetaRII, activates Smad2 and mitogen-activated protein kinases p44 and p42 (p42/44(mapk)).
We studied whether D-glucose-stimulation of L-arginine transport and nitric oxide synthesis involves TGF-beta1 in primary cultures of HUVEC.
TGF-beta1 release was higher ( approximately 1.6-fold) in 25 mM (high) compared with 5 mM (normal) D-glucose.
TGF-beta1 increases L-arginine transport (half maximal effect approximately 1.6 ng/ml) in normal D-glucose, but did not alter high D-glucose-increased L-arginine transport.
TGF-beta1 and high D-glucose increased hCAT-1 mRNA expression ( approximately 8-fold) and maximal transport velocity (V(max)), L-[(3)H]citrulline formation from L-[(3)H]arginine (index of NO synthesis) and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) protein abundance, but did not alter eNOS phosphorylation.
TGF-beta1 and high D-glucose increased p42/44(mapk) and Smad2 phosphorylation, an effect blocked by PD-98059 (MEK1/2 inhibitor).
However, TGF-beta1 and high D-glucose were ineffective in cells expressing a truncated, negative dominant TbetaRII.
High D-glucose increases L-arginine transport and eNOS expression following TbetaRII activation by TGF-beta1 involving p42/44(mapk) and Smad2 in HUVEC.
Thus, TGF-beta1 could play a crucial role under conditions of hyperglycemia, such as gestational diabetes mellitus, which is associated with fetal endothelial dysfunction.
