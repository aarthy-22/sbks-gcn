COMPOSITIO FOR TUNGSTE CMP BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0001] Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) compositions a»d methods for polishing (or planarizing) the surface of a substrate are well known in the art, .Polishing compositions (also known as polishing slurries, CMP slurries, and CMP compositions) for polishing metal layers (such as tungsten) on a semiconductor substrate may include abrasive particles suspended in an aqueous solution and chemical accelerators such as oxidizers, 'chelating agents, catalysts, and the like. |0002j In a conventional CMP operation, the substrate (wafer) to be polished is mounted on a carrier (polishing head) which is in turn mounted on a carrier assembly and positioned in contact, with a polishing pad in a CMP apparatus (polishing tool). The carrier assembly provides a controllable pressure to tire substrate, pressing the substrate against the polishing pad. The substrate and pad are moved relative to one another by an external driving force. The relative motion of the substrate and pad abrades and removes a portion of the material from the surface of the substrate, thereby polishing the substrate. The polishing of the substrate by the relative -movement of the pad and the substrate may be further aided by the chemical activity of the polishing composition (e.g., by an oxidizing agent and other chemical compounds present in the CMP composition) and/or the mechanical, activity of an abrasive suspended in the polishing composition. [0003] In typical tungsten plug and interconnect processes, tungsten is deposited over a dielectric and within openings formed therein. The excess tungsten over the dielectric layer is then removed during a CMP operation to form tungsten pings and interconnects within the dielectric. As semiconductor device feature sizes continue to shrink, meeting local and global planarity requirements has become more d ficult in CMP operations (e.g., in tungsten CMP operations). Array erosion (also referred to as oxide erosion), plug and line .recessing, and tungsten etching defects are known to compromise planarity and overall device integrity. For example, excessive array erosion may lead to difficulties in subsequent lithography steps as well as cause electrical contact problems that can degrade electrical performance. Tungsten etching/corrosion and plug.'and. line recessing may also degrade electrical performance or even cause device feirare. }0004| Commercially available tungsten CMP slurries commonly make use of a hydrogen peroxide oxidizer. While there are many advantages to the use of hydrogen peroxide, it is known to cause excessive tungsten etching in certain CMP operations. In such operations it may be advantageous to reduce the rare at which tungsten etches (corrodes) in the CMP composition. Thus, there is a need m the industry for tungsten CMP slurries (or compositions) that are less corrosive towards tungsten (i.e., in which tungsten etches at a lower rate). BRIEF SUMM ARY OF THE INVENTION [0005] A chemical mechanical polishing composition for polishing a substrate having a tungsten layer is disclosed. The polishing composition includes a water based liquid carrier, a colloidal silic abrasive dispersed in the liquid carrier and having a permanent positive charge of at least 6 mV, an amine compound in solution in the liquid carrier, and an iron containing accelerator. In one embodiment, the amine compound includes an aikyl group having at least 12 carbon atoms. A method for chemical mechanical pol ishing a substrate including a tungsten layer is further disclosed. The method may include contacting the substrate with the above described polishing composition, moving the polishing composition, relative to the substrate, and abrading the substrate to remove a portion of the tungsten frora the substrate and thereby polish the substrate, DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0006} A chemical mechanical polishing composition for polishing a substrate having a tungsten layer is disclosed. The polishing composition includes a water based liquid earner, a colloidal silica abrasive dispersed in the liquid carrier and having a permanent positive charge of at least 6 mV, and an amine compound in solution in the liquid carrier. The amine compound may include substantially any suitable amine compound, for example, a amine compound including an aikyl grou having 12 or more carbon atoms, a polycationic amine compound, and/or an amine containing polymer. The polishing composition may further optionally include an iron containing accelerator, such as an iron containing catalyst, a stabilizer bound to the iron containing accelerator, a hydrogen peroxide oxidizer, and/or a p.H in a range from 2.0 to 3.5. The colloidal silica may also be treated with an aminosi!ane compound. (0007 The polishing composition contains an abrasive including colloidal silica particles which are desirably suspended in a liquid carrier (e.g., water). As used herein the term colloidal silica panicles refers to silica particles that are prepared via a wet process rather than a pyrogenic or flame hydrolysis process which produces structurally different particles. The colloidal silica particles may be aggregated or non-aggregated. on-aggregated particles are individually discrete particles that may be spherical or nearly spherical in shape, but. can have other shapes as well (such as generally elliptical, square, or rectangular cross-sections). Aggregated particles are particles in which multiple discrete pariicies are clustered or bonded together to form aggregates having generally irregular shapes. [0908} Preferably, the colloidal silica is precipitated or condensation-polymerized silica, which may be prepared using any method known to those of ordinary skill in the art, such as by the sol gel roetliod or by silicate ion-exchange. Condensation-polymerized silica pariicies are often prepared by condensing SiiOHk to form, substantially spherical particles. The precursor SiiOH'k may be obtained, for example, by hydrolysis of high purity alkoxysilanes, or by acidification of aqueous silicate solutions. Such abrasive particles may be prepared, for example, in accordance with U.S. Pat. No. 5,230,833 or ma be obtained as any of various commercially available products such as the B!NDZIL 50/80, 30/31.0, and 40/130 products from ERA Chemicals, the Fuso PL-L PL-2, PI..-3, and PL-3H products, and the Nalco 1034A, 1050, 2327, and 2329 products, as well as other similar products available from DuPoni, Bayer, Applied Research, Nissan Chemical (the SNOWTEX products), and Clariant. [0009] The particle size of a particle is the diameter of the smallest sphere that encompasses the particle. The abrasive particles ma have any suitable particle size. The abrasive particles may have an average particle size of 5 nra or more (e.g., 10 nra or more, 15 ran or more, 20 urn or more, or 30 nra or more). The abrasive particles may have an average particle size of 150 nra or less (e.g., 130 nm or less, 80 nni or less, 50 rum or less, or 30 nm or less). Accordingly, the abrasive particles may have an average particle size in a range from 10 nra to 1 0 nm (e.g., from 20 nra t 1 30 run, from 15 nm to 100 nm, from 20 nm to 80 nm, or from 20 uni to 60 nm). [0910} "The polishing composition may include any suitable amount of colloidal silica particles. The polishing composition typically includes 0, 1 wt. % or more colloidal siiica (e.g., 0,05 wt. % or more). More typically, the polishing composition may include 0.1 wt. % or more (e.g., 1 wt. % or more, 5 wt. % or more, 7 wt. % or more, 10 wt. % or more, or 12 wt. % or more) colloidal siiica. pariicies. The amount of colloidal siiica particles in the polishing composition is typically 30 wt, % or less, and more typically 20 wt. % or less (e.g., 15 wt % or less, 1.0 wt. % or less, 5 wt. % or less, 3 wt. % or less, or 2 wt % or less). Preferably, the amount of colloidal siiica particles in the polishing composition is in a range from 0.01 wt. % to 20 wt. %, and more preferably from 0.05 wt. % to 15 wt. % (e.g., from 0.1 wt. % to 1.0 wt. %, from 0, 1 wt. % io 4 wt %, from 0, 1 wt, % to 3 wt. %, from 0,1 wt % to 2 wt. %, or from.0.2 wt. % to 2 w %). [0011] The liquid, carrier is used to facilitate the application of the abrasive and any optional chemical additives to the surface of a suitable substrate to be polished (e.g., planatized). The liquid carrier may be any suitable carder (e.g., a solvent) including lower alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanoi, etc.), ethers (e.g., dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, etc.), water, and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the liquid carrier comprises., consists essentially of, or consists of water, more preferably deionized water. |0612] The colloidal silica particles have a positive charge of at least 6 mV in the polishing composition. The charge on dispersed particles such as colloidal silica particles is commonly referred to in the art as the zeta potential (or the electrokinetic potential). The zeta potential of a particle refers to the electrical potential difference between the electrical charge of the ions surrounding the particle and the elec trical charge of the bulk solution of the polishing composition (e.g., the liquid carrie and. any other components dissolved therein). The zeta potential is typically dependent on the pH of the aqueous medium. For a given polishing composition., the isoelectric point of the particles is defined as the pH at which the zeta potential is zero. As the pH is increased or decreased away from the isoelectric point, the surface charge (and hence the zeta potential) is correspondingl decreased or increased (to negati ve or positive zeta potenti al values). The zeta potential of a dispersion such as a polishing composition may be obtained using commercially available instrumentation such as the Zetasizer available from Malvern instruments, the ZetaPlns Zeta Potential Analyzer available from Brookhaven Instruments, and an electro-acoustic spectrometer available from Dispersion Technologies, Inc. [0013] The colloidal silica particles in the polishing composition have a permanent positive charge of 6 mV or more (e.g., 10 m'V or more, 15 mV or more, 20 mV or more, 25 mV or more, or 30 mV or more). The colloidal silica particles in the polishing composition may have a permanent positive charge of 50 mV or less (e.g., 45 mV or less, 40 mV or less, or 35 mV or less). Preferably, the colloidal silica particles have a permanent positive charge in a range from 6 mV to 50 mV (e.g., 10 mV to 45 mV, 15 m'V to 40 mV, or 20 mV to 40 mV). [06141 By permanent positive charge it is meant thai the positive charge on the silica particles is not readily reversible, for example, via flushing, dilution, filtration, and the like. A permanent positi ve charge may be the result, for example, o covaienlly bonding a caiionic compound with the colloidal silica. A permanent positive charge is in contrast to a reversible positive charge that may be the result, for example, of an electrostatic interaction between a cationic compound and the colloidal silica. [0015] Notwithstanding, as used herein, a permanent positive charge of at least 6 mV means that the xeta potential of the colloidal silica particles remains above 6 mY after the following three step ultrafiltration test. A volume of the polishing composition (e.g., 200 ml) is passed through a Miliipore UhraceU regenerated cellulose ultrafilteation disk (e.g... having a MW cutoff of 100,000 Daltons and a pore size of 6.3 rim). The remaining dispersion (the dispersion that is retained by the ultrafiltration disk) is collected, and replenished to the original volume with pH adjusted deio ized water. The deionized water is pH adjusted to the original pH of the polishing composition using a suitable inorganic acid such as nitric acid. This procedure is repeated for a total of three ultrafiltration cycles (each of which includes an ultrafiltration step and a replenishing step). The zeta-potenrial of the triply ultra-filtered and replenished polishing composition is then measured and compared with the zeia potential of the original polishing composition. This three step ultrafiltration test is further illustrated below by way of example (in Example 5). (0016] While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the dispersion retained by the ultrafiltration disk (the retained dispersion) includes the colloidal silica particles and any chemical compounds (e.g., caiioaic compounds) that may be associated with the surface of the particles (e.g., bonded or attached to or electrostatically interacting with the particle surface). At least a portion of the liquid carrier and the chemical compounds dissolved therein pass through the ultrafiltration disk. Replenishing the retained dispersion to the original volume is believed to upset the equilibrium in the original polishing composition such that the chemical compounds associated with the particle surface may tend towards a new equilibrium. Compounds that are strongly associated (e.g., covalemly bonded) with the particle surface remain on the surface such thai there tends to be little if any change in the positive z-eta potential of the particle. In contrast, a portion of compounds that have a weaker association (e.g., an electrostatic interaction) with the particle surface may return to the solution as the system lends towards the new equilibrium thereby resulting in a reduction in the positive zeta potential. Repeating this process for a total of three ultrafiltration and replenishing cycles is believed to amplify the above described, effect. [0017] it is preferred that after correcting for ionic strength differences there is little (or no) difference between the zeta potential of the colloidal silica particles in the original polishing composition and the particles in the triply ultra-filtered, and. replenished polishing composition obtained from the above described three step ultrafiltration test. It will be understood that prior to correcting for ionic strength differences, the measured zeta potential may be observed to increase due to the reduced ionic strength (owing to dilution} of the triply ultra-filtered and replenished polishing composition. After correcting for ionic strength differences, it is preferred that any reduction in the positive charge (reduction in the positive zela potential) on the particles resulting from the aforementioned three step ultrafiltration tesi is less than 10 mV (e.g., less than 7 mV, less than 5 mV, or even less than 2m V). [0038} The polishing composition is general ly acidic having a pH of less than 7. The polishing composition typically has a pH of 1 or more (e.g., 1.5 or more, or 2 or more). Preferably, the polishing composition has a pH of 6 or less (e.g., 5 or less, or 4 or less). More preferably, the polishing composition has pH in a range from I to 6 (e.g., from 1 .5 to 5, or from 2 to 4, or from 2 to 3,5). The pH of the polishing composition may be achieved and/or maintained, by any suitable means. The polishing composition may include substantially any suitable pH adjusting agents or buffering systems. For example, suitable pH adjusting agents may include nitric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, phthalic acid, citric acid, adipic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, maleic acid, ammonium hydroxide, and the like while suitable buffering agents may include phosphates, sulfates, acetates, malonates, oxalates, borates, ammonium salts, and the like. [0919} Colloidal silica particles having a permanent positive charge in the polishing composition may be achieved, for example, via treating the particles with at least one anunosilane compound. Such compounds include primary aminosilanes, secondary aminosilanes, tertiary aminosilanes, quaternary aminosilanes, and. multi-podal (e.g., dipodal) aminosilanes. The arainos.ila.oe compound can be any suitable aminosilane, such as bis(2- hydroxyethyI)-3-aminopropyl iriaikoxysilane, diethylaminomeiliyitrialkoxysifane, (N,N- dieth.yl-3-ami.nopropyl)trialkoxysilane)5 3 l-stvrylmeihyl-2-aminoethylaminopjropyl trialkoxysilane, aniinopropyl trialkoxysilane, (2- -benzyl.aminoetliyl)-3-anmiopropyi trialkoxystlane), trialkoxysilyl propyl- ,Ν,Ν-triniethyl ammonium chloride, N- (trialkoxy¾ilylethyl)be.nzyl-N,N5N-lrimethyi ammonium chloride, (bis(methyldialkoxysilylpropyl)-N-methyl amine, bis(trialkoxysily1propyl)urea, bis(3- (ttialkoxysilyl)propyl)-ethylenediamine, bis(ti-.ialkoxysily1propyl)amin.e, bis(tfialkoxysilylpropyl)affline, and mixtures thereof. (0020) Any suitable method of treating the colloidal silica particles, many of which are known to those of ordinary skill in t he art ma be used. For example, the colloidal silica particles may be treated with the aminosilane compound before mixing with the other components of the polishing composition or the aminosilane and the colloidal silica particles may be added simultaneously to the other components of the polishing composition. [0021] The aminosilane compound may be present in the polishing composition in my suitable amount. The amount of aminosilane utilised may depend on several factors, for example, including the particle size, the surface area of the particle, the particular aminosilane compound used, and the desired charge on the particle, in general the amount of aminosilane used increases with decreasing particle size (and therefore increasing surface area) and increasing charge on the particle. For example, to achieve a permanent positive charge of 25 mV or more, 2 ppm or more of aminosilane may be used for a dispersion having a particle size of 1 10 nrn, 70 ppm or more of aminosilane may be used for a dispersion having a particle size of 75 nm, and 1 0 ppm or more of aminosilane may be used for a dispersion having a particle size of 55 nm. Thus the polishing composition may include 5 ppm or more {e.g., 1 ppm or more, 15 ppm or more, or 20 ppm or more) of the aminosilane compound. The polishing composition preferably includes an amount of aminosilane sufficient to provide the desired permanent positive charge without using an excess. Thus the polishing composition may incl ude 500 ppm or less (e.g., 300 ppm or less, or 200 ppm or less, or 15 ppm or less) of the aminosilane compound. Preferably, the polishing composition includes a range from 5 ppm to 500 ppm (e.g., from 10 ppm to 300 ppm, from 15 ppm to 200 ppm, or from. 20 ppm to 150 ppm) of the aminosilane compound. [0922] Optional embodiments of the polishing composition may further include an iron containing accelerator. An iron containing accelerator as itsed herein is an iron containing chemical compound that increases the removal rate of tungsten during a tungsten CMP operation. For example, the iron containing accelerator ma include an iron containing catalyst, such as is disclosed in U.S. Patents 5,958,288 and 5,980,775, Such an. iron containing catalyst may be soluble in the liquid carrier and. may include, for example, ferric (iron III) or ferrous (iron 11) compounds such as iron nitrate, iron sulfate, iron halides, including fluorides, chlorides, bromides, and iodides, as well as perchiorates, perhroniates and. periodates, and organic iron compounds such as iron acetates, acetylacetonat.es, citrates, gluconates, rnaio.na.ies, oxalates, phthaiaies, and succinates, and mixtures thereof. |0023| An iron containing accelerator may also include an iron containing activator (e.g., a free radical producing compound) or an iron containing catalyst associated with, (e.g., coaled or bonded to) the surface of the colloidal silica particle such as is disclosed in U.S. Patents 7,029,508 and 7,077,880. For example, the iron containing accelerator may be- bonded with the si lanoi groups on the surface of the colloidal surface particle, in one embodiment the iron containing accelerator may include a boron containing stabilizer and an iron containing catalyst. In such embodiments the stabilizer and catalyst may occupy substantially any percentage of the available surface sites on the colloidal silica particles, for example, greater than .1 %, greater than 50%, or greater than 80% of the available surface sites. [Θ024] The amount of iron containing accelerator in the polishing composition may be varied depending upon the oxidizing agent, used and the chemical form of the accelerator. When the preferred oxidizing agent hydrogen peroxide (or its analogs) is used and a soiuble iron containing catalyst is used (such as ferric nitrate), the catalyst may be present in the composition in an amount sufficient to provide a range from 1 to 3000 ppra Fe based on the total weight of the coraposition. The polishing composition preferably includes 1 ppm Fe or more (e.g., 5 ppm or more, 1 ppm or more, or 20 ppm or more). The polishing composition preferably includes 50 ppm Fe or less (e.g. , 200 ppm or less, 100 ppm or less, or 50 ppm or less). The polishing composition ma thus include a range from .1 to 500 ppm Fe (e.g., from 3 to 200 ppm, from 5 to 100 ppm, or from 10 to 50 ppm). (06251 Embodiments of the polishing composition including an iron containing accelerator ma further include a stabilizer. Without such a stabilizer, the iron containing accelerator and the oxidizing agent may react in a manner that degrades the oxidizing agent rapidly o ver time. The addition of a stabilizer tends to reduce the effectiveness of the iron containing accelerator such thai the choice of the type and amount of stabilizer added to the polishing composition may have a significant impact on CMP performance. The addition of a stabilizer may lead to the formation of a stabilizer/accelerator complex that inhibits the accelerator from reacting with the oxidizing agent while at the same time allowing the accelerator to remain sufficiently active so as to promote rapid tungsten polishing rates. [0926} Useful stabilizers include phosphoric acid, organic acids, phosphonate compounds, nitrites, and other ligands which bind to the metal and reduce its reactivity toward hydrogen peroxide decomposition and mixture (hereof. The acid stabilizers may be used in their conjugate form, e.g., the carboxylase can be used instead of the carboxylic acid.. For purposes of this application the term "acid" as it is used to describe useful stabilizers also means the conjugate base of the acid stabilizer. For example the term "adipic acid" means adipic acid and its conjugate base. Stabilizers can be used alone or in combination and significantly decrease the rate at which oxidixing agents such as hydrogen peroxide decomposes. [0027} Preferred stabilizers include phosphoric acid, phthalic acid, citric acid, adipic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, aspartic acid, succinic acid, gUnaric acid, pimelic acid, suberic acid, azelatc acid, sebacic acid, maSeic acid, gktaconic acid, muconic acid, elhyfenediaminetetntacet-c acid (EDTA), propylenedia metetsaacetic acid (PDTA), and mixtures thereof. The preferred stabilizers may be added to the compositions and slurries of this invention in an amount ranging from 1 equivalent per iron containing accelerator to 3.0 weight percent or more. As used herein, the term "equivalent per iron containing accelerator" means one molecule of stabilizer per iron ion. in the composition. For example 2 equivalents per iron containing accelerator means two molecules of stabilizer for each catalyst ion. |0028| The poU.sh.ing composition may further include an oxidizing agent. The oxidizing agent may be added to the polishing composition during the slurry manufacturing process or just prior to the CMP operation (e.g., in a tank located at the semiconductor fabrication facility). Preferable oxidizing agents include inorganic or organic per-compounds. A per- compound as defined by Hawley's Condensed Chemical Dictionary is a compound containing at least one peroxy group (-0-0-) or a compound containing an element in its highest oxidation state. Examples of compounds containing at ieasi one peroxy group include but are not limited to hydrogen peroxide and its adducts such as urea hydrogen peroxide and percarbonates, organic peroxides such as benzoyl peroxide, peracetic acid, and di-t-butyl peroxide, mo.nopersulfa.tes (80s ' ), dipersaifates (SjO ), and sodium peroxide. Examples of compounds containing an. element in its highest oxidation state include but are not limited to periodic acid, periodate salts, perbronuc acid, perbromate salts, perchloric acid, perchiorate salts, perboric acid, and perborate salts and permanganates. The most preferred, oxidizing agents is hydrogen peroxide. 1002&I The oxidizing agent may be present in the polishing composition in an amount ranging, for example, from 0.1 to 10 weight percent. In preferred embodiments in which a hydrogen peroxide oxidizer and. a. soluble iron containing accelerator are used, the oxidizer may be present in the polishing composition in an amount ranging from 0.1 to 6 weight percent (e.g., from 0.2 to 5 weight percent, from 0.5 to 4 weight percent, or from 1 to 3 weight percent). j003wj The polishmg composition further includes an amine compound in solution in the liquid carrier. The amine compound may include substantially any amine compound thai inhibits tungsten etching (i.e., reduces tungsten eich. rates) in the presence of an oxidizer such as hydrogen peroxide. The addition of an amine compound may also have a negative impact on CMP performance. Thus the amine compound may be selected such that it advantageously inhibits tungsten etching while at the same time allowing for high tungsten removal rates during the CMP operation. The amine compound (or compounds) may include a primary amine, a secondary amine, a tertiary amine, or a quaternary amine. The amine compound may further include a monoamine, a diamine, a triami.ne, a. letramiiie, or art amine based polymer having a large number of repeating amine groups (e.g., 4 or more amine groups). [Θ03Ι j In certain embodiments of the polishing compound the amine compoun d may include a long chain, alkyl group. By long chain alkyl group it. is meant that the amine compound includes an alkyl group having at least 10 carbon atoms (e.g., at least 12 carbon atoms or at least 14 carbon atoms). Such amine compounds may include, for example, dodecyiamme, tetradecvl amine, hexadecylamine, octadecyl amine, oley! amine, N~ methyldioctylarn ne, N-methyloctadecylamine, cocamidopropylamine oxide, benzyldimethylhexadecylamnioniuni chloride, benzaikonium chloride, cocoalkylmelhyi[polyoxyeib.y!ene (15) j ammonium chloride, ocladecylmethyljpolyoxyethyiene ( 15)] ammonium, chloride, cetvltrimeihylammoni ra bromide, and ihe like. (0032 | In certain embodiments of the polishing composition the amine compound may include a polyeatiortie amine, A poiyeaiiomc amine (as the term, is used herein) is an amine compound having multiple (two or more) amine groups in. which each of the amine groups is cationic (i.e., has a positive charge). Thus the polycationic amine may include a polyquaiernary amine. By polyquaieraary amine it is meant tha the amine compound includes from 2 to 4 quaternary ammonium groups such that the polyquaiernary amine is a dtquaternary amine, a triquateraary amine, or a tetraquaternary amine compound. Diquatemary amine compounds may include, for example, N,N!- methyle.nebis(dime{liylietradecylaramoiiium bromide), .1 ,1 , ,4-t.ei.rabuiyipiperazinediinm di bromide, NyN^'^ '-pentamethyl- -tallow-l^-propane-diammonium dichloride, N,N - hexamethylenebisitri utylammottium hydroxide), decamethotnnm bromide, didodecyi- tetraraethyl- ,4-butanediaminium dikxlide, 1 ,5-dimethyl- 1 ,5-diazoniabicyclo('3.2.2)nonane di.bromi.de, and the like. Triquateraary amine compounds may include, for example, N(I ), (6)-didoecyi-N(l), ( l),N(6),hK'6)-ie diiodide. Tetraquateraary amine compounds may include, for example, methanetetrayltetrakis(tetramethylammonium bromide). The polyquaiernary amine compound may further include a long chain alkyl group (e.g., having 1 or more carbon atoms). For example, a polyqyaternary amine compound having a long chain, alkyl group may include Ν,Μ'-raethylenebis (dimemyiletradecyl ammonium bromide), , ,Ν',Ν',Ν'- pen.tamethyl- -tallow- 1 ,3-propane-diammonium dichl ride, didodecyl-tetramelhyl- 1 ,4- bitianediaminium diiodide. and N(l),N(6)- Jidodecyi-N(l.),N(.l ), (6),N(6Hetramethyl-i ,6- hexanediammium diiodide. [0033] A polyeaiiome amine m ay also be polycationic in that each of the amine groups is protonated (and therefore has a positive charge). For example, a dkaiionic amine such as tetramethyi-p-phenylenediamine includes iwo tertiary amine groups that may be protonated (and therefore positively charged) at polishing composition pH values less than the pKa of the amine compound. [0034] In certain embodiments of the polishing composition the amine compound ma include an amine based polymer. Such a polymer includes four or more amine groups. The amine based polymer may include, for example, triethyleneietramine, teiraethylenepeniarnine, pentaeihylenehexamine, and polymers including the following amine containing Junctional groups methacryloytax-ethyi mmethyl ammonium methylsuliale, diaJ'iyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, and meihacryiamido-propyi trimethyS ammonium chloride. [0035] It will be understood that the amine compound does not include a heterocyclic polyamine. Heterocyclic poiyanimes are amine compounds having multiple amine groups in which at least one of the amine groups is located in. a ring (e.g., a ring including 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 members). Such heterocyclic amine compounds include, for example, certain pyridine, pyTidylamiiie, pyrimidme, and azoie compounds. While such heterocyclic poiyanimes (such as ben oiriazole) are known inhibitors of copper etching, their utility in inhibiting tungsten etching tends io be limited. As such the are not particularl useful in the disclosed tungsten CMP compositions. [0036] The polishing composition may include substantially any suitable concentration of the amine compound. In general the concentration is desirably high enough to provide adequate etch inhibition, but low enough so that the compound is soluble and so as not to reduce tungsten polishing rates below acceptable levels. By soluble it is meant that the compound is fully dissolved in the liquid carrier or that it forms micelles in the liquid carrier or is carried hi micelles. It may be necessary to vary the concentration of the amine compound depending upon numerous various factors, for example, including the solubility of the amine compound, the number of amine groups in the amine compound, the length of an alkyl group in the amin compound, the relationship between etch rate inhibition and polishing rate inhibition, the oxidizing agent used, the concentration of the oxidizing agent, and so on, in certain desirable embodiments, the concentration of the amine compound in the polishing composition is in a range from 0.1 μΜ to 10 mM (i.e., from 10" to I0*2 molar). For example, m embodiments utilizing an amine based polymer having a high molecular weight, the concentration may be on the lower end of the range (e.g., from 10"' to JO"4 molar). In other embodiments utilizing a comparatively simple amine compound {having fewer amine groups and a Sower molecular weight), the concentration may be on the higher end of the range (e.g., from Ηϊ~' to 1 '~ molar). J0037J The polishing composition may optionally further include a biocide. Tire biocide may include any suitable biocide, for example an isothiazolinone biocide. The amount of biocide in the polishing composition typically is in a range from I ppm to 50 ppm, and preferably from 1 ppm to 20 ppm, [0038) The polishing composition may be prepared using any suitable techniques, many of which are known to those skilled in the art. The polishing composition may be prepared in a batch or continuous process. Generally, the polishing composition may be prepared by combining the components thereof in any order. The term "component" as used herein includes the individual ingredients (e.g., the coiioidal silica, the iron containing accelerator, the amine compound, etc.) [0039) for example, the silica may be dispersed in the aqueous liquid carrier. The silica may then be treated, for example, with an aminosilane so as to produce generate a coiioidal ilica having a permanent positive charge of at least 6 roV, Other components such as an iron containing accelerator, a stabilizer, and the amine compound may then be added and. mixed by any method that is capable of incorporating the components into the polishing composition. The oxidizing agent may be added at any time during the preparation of the polishing composition. For example, the polishing composition may be prepared prior to use, with one or more components, such as the oxidizing agent, being added just prior to the CMP operation (e.g., within 1 minute, or within 10 minutes, or within 1 hour, or within I day, or within 1 week of the CMP operation). The polishing composition also may also be prepared by mixing the components at the surface of the substrate (e.g., on the polishing pad.) during the CM P operation. 10040] Tire polishing composition may be supplied as a one-package system comprising a colloidal silica having a permanent positive charge of at; least 6 mV, an amine compound, an optional iron containing accelerator and stabilizer, an optional biocide, and water. The oxidizing agent desirably is supplied separately from the other components of the polishing composition and is combined, e.g., by the end-user, with the other components of the polishing composition shortly before use (e.g., 1 week or less prior to use, 1 day o less prior to use, 1 hour or less prior to use, 10 minutes or less prior to use, or 1 minute or less prior to use). Various other two-container, or three- or more-container, combinations of the components of the polishing composition ar within the knowledge of one of ordinar ski!! in the art. [Θ041 j The polishing composition of the invention may also be provided as a concentrate which is intended to be diluted with an. appropriate amount of water prior to use. In such an embodiment, the polishing composition concentrate may include the colloidal silica having a permanent positive charge of at least 6 raV, the amine c-om-pound, the optional iron containing accelerator and stabilizer, the optional biocide, and water, with or without, the oxidizing agent, in amounts such that, upon dilution of the concentrate with art appropriate amount of water, and the oxidizing agent if not already present in an appropriate amount, each component of the polishing composition wiii be present in the polishing composition in an amount within the appropriate range recited above for each component. For example, the colloidal silica, having a permanent positive charge of at least 6 mV, the amine compound, the optional iron containing accelerator and the stabilizer, may each be present in. the polishing composition in an amount that, is 2 times (e.g., 3 times. 4 times, 5 times, or even 10 times) greater than the concentration recited above for each component so that, when, the concentrate is diluted with an equal volume of (e.g., 2 equal volumes of water, 3 equal volumes of water, 4 equal volumes of water, or even 9 equal volumes of water respectively), along with the oxidizing agent in a suitable amount, each component will be present in the polishing composition in an amount within the ranges set forth above for each component. Furthermore, as wilt be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, the concentrate may contain an appropriate fraction of the water present in the final polishing composition in order to ensure that other components are at least partially or fully dissolved in the concentrate. [Θ042] Although the polishing composition of the invention may be used to polish any substrate, the polishing composition is particularly useful in the polishing o a substrate comprising at least one metal including tungsten and at least one dielectric materia!. The tungsten layer may be deposi ed over one or more barrier layers, for example, including titanium and/or titanium nitride (TiN). The dielectric layer may be a metal, oxide such as a silicon oxide layer derived from tetraethylorthosilieate (TBOS), porous metal oxide, porous or non-porous carbon doped silicon oxide, fluorine-doped silicon oxide, glass, organic polymer, fluorinated organic polymer, or any other suitable hig or low-k insulating layer. [0043} The polishing method of the invention is particularly suited for use in conjunction with a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) apparatus. Typically, the apparatus includes a platen, which, when in use, is in motion and has a velocity that results from orbital, linear, or circular motion, a polishing pad in contact with the platen and moving with the platen when in .motion, and a carrier that holds a substrat to be polished by contacting and moving relative to ihe surface of the polishing pad. The polishing of the substrate takes place by the substrate being placed in contact with ihe polishing pad and the polishing composition of the invention and then the polishing pad moving relative to the substrate, so as to abrade at least a portion of the substrate (such as tungsten, titanium, titanium nitride, and/or a dielectric material as described herein) to polish the substrate, [0044] A substrate can be planarked or polished with the chemical mechanical polishing composition with any suitable polishing pad (e.g., polishing surface). Suitable polishing pads include, for example, woven and non-woven polishing pads. Moreover, suitable polishing pads can comprise any suitable polymer of varying density, hardness, thickness, compressibility, ability to rebound upon compression, and compression modulus. Suitable polymers include, for example, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylfluoride, nylon, fiuorocarbon, polycarbonate, polyester, poiyaciyiaie, poiyether, polyethylene, polyamide, poJyurethane, polystyrene, polypropylene, coformed products thereof, and mixtures thereof. [0045] The followin examples farther illustrate the invention but, of course, should, not be construed as in any way limiting its scope, EXAMPLE 1 [0646] A number of poli hing compositions were prepared in order to evaluate various performance metrics of the compositions. A standard composition was used as a base composition for alt formulations with only ihe amount and type of amine compound varied. The standard composition was prepared as follows: A dispersion was prepared including 3.0 weight percent colloidal silica and 0.01 weight percent (1 0 ppm) of bis-iganima-trimethoxysilylpropyDamine (an aminosilane). The dispersion was prepared by mixing a concentrated colloidal silica dispersion having a mean particle size of 75 am (such as are commercially available from Akso Nobel, Fuso, and Nalco as listed above) with the aminosilane and water. The dispersion was mixed for a number of hours to adequately treat th colloidal silica with the aminosilane. The treated colloidal, silica dispersion was then added to a mixture including malonic acid, ferric nitrate, and water such that the final concentrations in the composition were as follows: 2.0 weight percent treated colloidal silica, 0.0031 weight percent ferric nitrate, and 0.06? weight percent maSonic acid. The pH of the mixture was then adjusted to 2,4 using nitric acid. This mixture was used as a stock solution in which various amine compounds were dissolved, prior to performing zeta potential measurements, static etch tests, ami CMP tests as described in more detail in the subsequent examples. EXAMPLE 2 [0047] The tungsten etch rat and zeia potential of the colloidal silica were evaluated in this example for various polishing compositions. This example demonstrates the effect of various amine compounds as a function of the longest alkyl chain length in the amine compound. To obtain the tungsten etch rate for each polishing composition, the composition was first heated to 45 degrees C after which hydrogen peroxide was added to a concentration of 2 percent. After waiting 5 minutes for the temperature to return to 45 degrees, a two-inch wafer having a tungsten layer was submersed in the polishing compositions for 5 minutes. Tungsten removal rates were determined via resistivity measurements made before and after immersion in the polishing compositions. The .eta potential measurements were obtained using a DTI 200 electro-acoustic spectrometer available from Dispersion Technologies, inc. The polishing compositions (Controls A and B and inventive compositions 2A through 2M) were obtained by adding an appropriate amount of the indicated amine compound to a sample of the stock solution described above in Example 1. The alkyl. chain length (in number of carbon atoms), the concentration of th amine compound, the tungsten etch rate, and the zeta potential of the colloidal silica particles ar indicated in Table I .

Table 1 jiM Sj As is apparent fxom the results set forth in Table 1 , compositions 2A-2G, which included amine compounds having an aifcyl chain length greater than 10 ( 12, 14, 16, and 18) exhibited W etch rates of one-tenth or less that of control A (no inhibitor) and one-seventh or less that of control B (glycine). EXAMPLE 3 [Θ049] The tungsten etch rate and zeta potential of the colloidal silica were evaluated in this example for various other polishing compositions. This example demonstrates the effect of various amine containing polymers (3A-3E). The tungsten etch rates and zeta potential measurements were obtained using the same methodologies as described in Example 2. The polishing compositions (controls A and B and inventive compositions 3A through 3E) were obtained by adding an appropriate amount of the indicated amine compound to a sample of the stock solution described above i Example I. The alkyl chain length (in number of carbon atoms), the concentration of the amine compound, the tungsten etch rate, and the zeta potential of the colloidal silica are indicated in Table 2. Control A included no inhibitor and control B included glycine, inventive samples 3A through 3E included the following amine compounds: (3A) Merquat 280 which is a polymer having alternating diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride and acrylic acid groups and having a molecular weight of 450,000, (3.B) Merquat 106 which is a polymer having repeating dimethyl ammonium chloride groups and a molecular weight of 15,000, (3C) pentaefhylenehexamine, (3D) letraeihylenepentamine, and.

The etch rate of composition 3.E was similar to that of control A (no inhibitor). EXAMPLE 4 (βθδΐ The tungsten etch rate and zeta potential of the colloidal silica were evaluated in this example for still other polishing compositions. This example demonstrates the effect of various pol cationic amine containing compounds (4A-4 ). The tungsten etch rates and /eta potential measurements were obtained using the same methodologies as described in Example 2, The polishing compositions (controls A and B and inventive compositions 4A through 4 ) were obtained by adding an appropriate amount of the indicated amine compound to a sample of the stock solution described above in Example I .

EXAMPLE 5 [0953] The tungsten etch rate and .eta potential of the colloidal silica were evaluated in this example for various other polishing compositions. This example demonstrates the effect of various heterocyclic polyamme compounds. The tungsten etch rates and zeta potential measurements were obtained using the same methodologies as described in Example 2. The polishing compositions (controls A and B and compositions 5A through 5F) were obtained by adding an appropriate amount of the indicated amine compound to a sample of the stock solution described above in Example 1. The aikyl chain length (in number of carbon atoms), the concentration of the amine compound, the tungsten etch rate., and the zeta potential of the colloidal silica are indicated in Table 4.

Table 4 jO054| As is apparent from the results set forth in Table 4, none of compositions 5A through 5F exhibited a W etch rate ofless than that of the glycine control Ail but composition 5B exhibited W etch rates about equal to or greater than the control including no inhibitor. EXAMPLE 6 [0055} Zeta potential measurements and cotiductivity measurements- were obtained for treated silica samples before and after filtration. A 200 ml volume of each composition was filtered through a Millipore Ultracell regenerated cellulose ultrafiltration disk (having a MW cutoff of 100,000 Daltons and a pore size of 6.3 nm). The remaining dispersion (the dispersion that was retained by the ultrafiltration disk) was collected and replenished to the original 200 ml volume using deronized water adjusted to p.H 2.6 with nitric acid. This procedure was repeated for a total of three ultrafiltration cycles (each of which includes an ultrafiltration step and a replenishing step). The zeta-potentiai and electrical conductivity of the polishing composition were measured before and after the ultrafiltration procedure (i.e., on the original polishing composition and the ttiply ultra-filtered and replenished polishing composition). Table 5 shows the measured zeta potential and conductivity for polishing compositions 6A and 6B. Polishing composition 6A contained a 55 nm colloidal silica treated with 3-(amiuopropyl)lri.methoxylsilane while polishing composition 6.8 contained a 55 nm colloidal silica treated with tetrabutylamraoniam hydroxide. As described above, the zeta potential and electrical conductivity of the original compositions were measured before and after above described ultrafiltration procedure. Corrected zeta-potential values of the triply ultra-filtered and replenished polishing composition (corrected for ionic strength differences as indicated by the conductivity change) are also shown. (0056) As is apparent from the results set forth in Table 5, the zeta potential of sample 6A is not changed by filtration indicating thai the colloidal silica has a permanent positive charge of 41 mV. The zeta potential of sample 6B decreased from 10 to 3 roV indicating that the positive charge colloidal silica was not permanent. EXAMPLE 7 (0057] Both the tungsten etch rate and the tungsten polishing rate were evaluated in this example for various polishing compositions. This example demonstrates the effect of various amine compounds on the tungsten etch rates and tungsten polishing rales for the corresponding polishing compositions.

The tungsten polishing rates were obtained using a Mima® CMP Tool (available from Applied Materials). Eight inch wafers having a tungsten layer deposited on a surface thereof were polished on an iC 1010 polishing pad at a down-force of 1 .5 psi, a p laten speed of 100 rpm, and a slurry flow rate of 150 ml/min. The polishing compositions (the control and compositions 6A through 61 were obtained by adding art appropriate amount of the indicated amine compound to a sample of (he stock solution described above in Example 1. The alkyl chain length (in number of carbon atoms,), the concentration of the amine compound (in ppm by weight), the tungsten etch rate, and the tungsten polishing rate are indicated in Table 6.

Table 6 [ΘΘ59) As is apparent from the results set forth in Table 6, compositions 6B and 6D exhibit etch rates significantly less than the control and W polishing rate only marginally less than the control. Compositions 6C (high concentration) and 6G exhibit both etch rates and W polishing rates that are significantly less man the control.
