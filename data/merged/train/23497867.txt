AKT signalling and mitochondrial pathways are involved in mushroom polysaccharide-induced apoptosis and G1 or S phase arrest in human hepatoma cells.
This study describes molecular mechanisms for inhibiting tumour cell proliferation using polysaccharides from medicinal mushrooms in human hepatoma cells.
The results show that regarding cell cycle-related proteins, three types of polysaccharides significantly enhance the expression of p27(Kip) in HepG2 and Bel-7404 cells, while suppressing the activity of cyclin D1/CDK4 and/or cyclin E/CDK2.
Considering apoptosis-related factors, the polysaccharides suppressed AKT activity through the inhibition of AKT phosphorylation at Thr(308) and/or Ser(473).
The growth of HepG2 and Bel-7404 cells was suppressed by the up-regulation of a subunit of PI3K and phospho-PTEN, which are modulators of AKT activity.
The polysaccharides also activated the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway by stimulating the activation of Bcl-2 family proteins to release cytochrome c and Smac and cleave caspase-9 and caspase-3 in HepG2 and Bel-7404 cells.
These factors have a potent effect on cell cycle arrest in G(1) and/or S phase and induce apoptosis in HepG2 and Bel-7404 cells.
