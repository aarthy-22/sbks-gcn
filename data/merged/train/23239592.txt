Three-Dimensional CdS-Titanate Composite Nanomaterials for Enhanced Visible-Light-Driven Hydrogen Evolution.
3D Hierarchical echinus-like titanate spheres (HETSs), serving as the supporting material for CdS nanoparticles, are synthesized via a fast one-step hydrothermal method.
The obtained 3D CdS-HETS composite materials show enhanced H2 generation under visible light irradiation.
