Effect of tetrabrombisphenol A on induction of apoptosis in the testes and changes in expression of selected testicular genes in CD1 mice.
Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) is a substance widely used in industry as a flame retardant.
TBBPA was found in the environment and was detected even in the human body.
The effect of this chemical was observed in different cell lines in vitro and it is supposed that TBBPA may affect various hormonal systems in vivo.
In this study we examined the effect of TBBPA on the reproductive parameters of two generations of outbred mice in vivo.
Experimental and control animals of F1 generation were bred in various conditions to enable evaluation of the possible trans-generational effect.
An increased incidence of apoptosis in the testes and changes in the morphometry of seminiferous tubules was detected in the experimental animals.
In addition, changes in the expression pattern of selected genes encoding proteins that play an important role during spermatogenesis were observed.
In contrast, sperm quality and reproduction were not affected by TBBPA.
