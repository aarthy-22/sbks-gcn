Effect of Korean pear (Pyruspyrifolia cv.
Shingo) juice on hangover severity following alcohol consumption.
Korean pear has been used as a traditional prophylactic agent for alcohol hangover.
However, its mechanism was not investigated in human yet.
Therefore, we performed a randomized single blind crossover trial with 14 healthy young men to examine effects of Korean pear juice on alcohol hangover.
All subjects consumed 540ml of spirits (alcohol conc.
20.1v/v%)
after 30min from the intervention, i.e. placebo or Korean pear juice treatment.
Blood and urine specimens were collected in time-courses (9 time-points for 15h after alcohol consumption).
The total and average of hangover severity were alleviated to 16% and 21% by Korean pear juice at 15h after the alcohol consumption (ps<0.05).
Particularly, 'trouble concentrating' was significantly improved by the pear juice treatment (p<0.05).
Impaired memory, sensitivity to light and sound, and mean of hangover severity were significantly improved by Korean pear juice among the subjects with ALDH2*1/*1 or ALDH2*1/*2 genotypes (ps<0.05) but not in the subjects with ALDH2*2/*2 genotype.
In addition, the pear juice treatment lowered levels of blood alcohol (p<0.01).
Therefore, Korean pear juice may alleviate alcohol-hangover and its detoxification of alcohol seems to be modified by the genetic variation of ALDH2.
