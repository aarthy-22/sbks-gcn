The present invention relates to a process for the synthesis of dasatinib and to intermediates useful for its preparation. Dasatinib belongs to a new class of targeted antitumoral drugs, the inhibitors of the tumoral growth; in particular it is an inhibitor of the tyrosine-kinase activity of BRC-ABL and further four oncogenic kinases which is mainly used in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disease, caused by the anomalous growth of pluripotent hemopoietic stem cells, i.e. still able to proliferate and differentiate; these cells, as indicated by the adjective "myelogenous", belong at first to the series leading to the formation of granulocytes, a type of white blood cells, but it may also be related to other cell series. The phases of the untreated disease are three: the initial or chronic phase, generally with a slow course, which length is from three to five years from the diagnosis; the accelerated phase which is observed in about the 2/3 of the patients with a length of two-fifteen months; the blastic phase, associated with an average survival of three-six months, which inevitably leads to death. In most of the patients it seems that CML is caused by the reciprocal translocation of DNA segments between the chromosomes 9 and 22, with formation of the so-called Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), corresponding to a chromosome 22 in which the fusion BCR-ABL gene was formed and code for a protein that makes the blastos "immortal". Dasatinib inhibits the activity of BCR-ABL through the competition with the ATP for the binding site on the tyrosine-kinase portion of the target protein of which the catalytic activity is inhibited, with the consequent block of the signal translation, so controlling the proliferation of the leukemia cells. Dasatinib is mainly used for the treatment of the patients who no longer respond to the treatment with imatinib. Dasatinib is a compound of formula I chemically known as N-(2-chloro-6-methylphenyl)-2-[6-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl]-2-methylpyrimidin-4-ylamino]thiazol-5-carboxamide, described in WO 00/62778 and sold under the name Sprycel®. Some processes for the preparation of dasatinib are known in the prior art. WO 00/62778 discloses a process for the synthesis of dasatinib as reported in the following scheme 1. EP 1 711 481 discloses a process for the synthesis of dasatinib as reported in the following scheme 2.
