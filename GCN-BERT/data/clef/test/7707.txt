Technical field The present invention is concerned with anticoagulants (i.e. substances that prevent blood clotting). More specifically, the present invention is concerned with antithrombotic oligosaccharides. Background art Heparin, a natural sulphated polysaccharide, is an anticoagulant that belongs to the family of glycosaminoglycans. The anticoagulant activity of heparin is due to its ability to accelerate the inhibition of several proteases, particularly factor Xa and thrombin, in the blood coagulation cascade. Heparin and heparin-derived drugs inhibit the activity of factor Xa by attaching to a specific binding domain of antithrombin (AT). Once heparin or heparin-derived drugs are attached to the specific binding domain of antithrombin, they induce a conformational change in antithrombin (AT). This conformational change in AT is responsible for inhibition of factor Xa. Investigations have shown that the lowest structural element capable of significantly binding AT, and inhibiting factor Xa, is a pentasaccharide. The prototype of such conformational-change-inducing products is fondaparinux. Fondaparinux sodium (Arixtra™ - GlaxoSmithKline) is the first of a new class of antithrombotic agents. It displays a half-life in rats of approximately one hour and of 17 h in human. It is given once a day to patients in need of an anticoagulant treatment. It is a chemically synthesised pentasaccharide mimicking the antithrombin binding site of heparin. It is a selective factor Xa inhibitor and thus an inhibitor of thrombin generation. The synthesis of fondaparinux is long and complicated. Thus, with the aim of simplifying the chemistry while maintaining the same activity and pharmacokinetic profile, new series of pentasaccharides described in US 5,543,403, WO 99/25720 or in WO 99/36428 have been designed. US 5,543,403 and WO 99/25720 disclose synthetic pentasaccharides in which N-sulfate, N-acetate and hydroxyl groups are replaced by alkoxy, and O-sulfate groups. WO 99/36428 discloses similar synthetic pentasaccharides, the L-iduronic unit of which is locked in a 2S0 conformation, and the D-glucuronic unit E of which has eventually an ethyl group at position 5. However, while the presence of alkyl groups on these pentasaccharides unit considerably simplifies their mode of preparation, it also increases the half-life making the clinical use problematic. EP 2 074 131 also attempts to provide synthetic pentasaccharides. In this application, it was considered that the ability of the pentasaccharides to go through the intestinal barrier was important for an application as antithrombotics. However, it appeared that many compounds disclosed by EP 2 074 131 also have a too long half-life. The half-life of anticoagulant pentasaccharides, the time required to halve the plasma concentration of the drug, is a very important pharmacokinetic parameter. Indeed, it is sometimes necessary, e.g. in case of an haemorrhage, to switch off as quickly as possible the anticoagulant effect so that the haemorrhage can be stopped. Suitable half-lives for an anticoagulant range from about 5 to about 20 hours in human, corresponding to 0.5 hour to about 3 hours in the rat. Introduction of a biotin moiety on the pentasaccharide allows fast suppression of the anticoagulant activity through injection of avidin, a protein that strongly binds to biotin. The biotin group (IUPAC name: 5-[(3aS,4S,6aR)-2-oxohexahydro-1H-thieno[3,4-d]imidazol-4-yl]pentanoic acid; aslo known as vitamin B7) represents the following group: Such biotinylated pentasaccharides are known from EP 1 322 673. Avidin prevents the compounds from having their effect on their targets and accelerates their elimination. The anti-factor Xa activity of the biotinylated compounds of EP322673 is equivalent to the activity of their non-biotinylated counterparts. Thus, it is possible to neutralize the anticoagulant activity of biotinylated compounds by administration of avidin which eventually allows using long half-life anticoagulant pentasaccharides. However, the enzyme biotinidase, that cleaves the amide bond at the carboxylate end of biotin, is present in blood plasma and could react with biotinylated compounds to de-biotinylate them. As a result, the de-biotinylated compounds are no longer neutralised by avidin while keeping their anticoagulant activity until they are physiologically washed out. This is a real problem because anticoagulant treatments can be given for long period of time and the de-biotinylated compound can accumulate in plasma. Therefore, it is still highly desirable to have biotinylated compounds with a short half-life to allow their immediate neutralization in case of emergency and to avoid their accumulation in plasma if they are de-biotinylated by biotinidase. The authors of the present invention have surprisingly found that the half-life of alkylated/O-sulfated pentasaccharides can be modulated by varying the substituent groups of the D-unit. Introducing an amino function at position 2 reduces the half-life. Biotinylation of this 2 amino-function increases the half-life Introducing one free hydroxyl function at the D-unit reduces the half-life. A combination of these various observations allowed the authors to identify potent inhibitors of factor Xa biotinylated pentasaccharides with a short half-life. Thus, one aim of the invention is to provide pentasaccharides, which are easy to synthesize and with a short half-life, and in particular biotinylated pentasaccharides. Another aim of the invention is to provide biotinylated pentasaccharides with high anti-factor Xa activity, i.e. low value of IC50. Therefore, all drawbacks of the prior art are overcome with the use of the compounds according to the invention, and more in particular the biotinylated ones.

Modes of Administration The compounds of the present invention can be delivered directly or in pharmaceutical compositions containing excipients (see above), as is well known in the art. The present methods of treatment involve administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention to a subject. The term "therapeutically effective amount" or "therapeutically effective dose" as used herein refers to an amount of a compound according to the present invention needed to: treat; ameliorate; prevent the targeted disease condition; exhibit a detectable therapeutic or preventative effect; prolong survival of a patient. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such molecules can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., by determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio of toxic to therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index, which can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Agents that exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred. The therapeutically effective amount or therapeutically effective dose is the amount of the compound or pharmaceutical composition that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, animal, or human that is being sought by the researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor, or other clinician. For example, anticoagulant activity and treatment of blood clotting disorders, e.g., deep vein thromboembolism including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, post surgical deep venous thrombosis, coronary syndromes, myocardial infarction, stroke, etc. The exact formulation, route of administration, dosage, and dosage interval should be chosen according to methods known in the art, in view of the specifics of a patient's condition. The specific dosage level required for any particular patient will depend on a number of factors, including severity of the condition being treated, the route of administration, the general health of the patient (i.e. age, weight and diet), the gender of the patient, the time and frequency of administration, judgement of the prescribing physician and tolerance/response to therapy. In general, however, the daily dose (whether administered as a single dose or as divided doses) will be in the range 0.01 to 500 mg per day, more usually from 0.1 to 50 mg per day, and most usually from 1 to 10 mg per day. Alternatively, dosages can be administered per unit body weight and, in this instance, a typical dose will be between 0.001 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg, especially between 0.01 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg, between 0.02 mg/kg and 0.1 mg/kg. Chemical Definitions In the interests of simplicity, terms which are normally used to refer to monovalent groups (such as "alkyl") are also used herein to refer to divalent, trivalent or tetravalent bridging groups which are formed from the corresponding monovalent group by the loss of one or more hydrogen atom(s). Whether such a term refers to a monovalent group or to a polyvalent group will be clear from the context. Where a polyvalent bridging group is formed from a cyclic moiety, the linking bonds may be on any suitable ring atom, according to the normal rules of valency. As used herein, the term "alkyl" refers to a straight or branched saturated monovalent hydrocarbon radical, having the number of carbon atoms as indicated. For example, the term "(C1-5)alkyl" includes C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5 alkyl groups. By way of non-limiting example, suitable alkyl groups include methyl (-Me), ethyl (-Et), propyl (-Pr), iso-propyl, butyl (-Bu), iso-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl (-Pent). Alkoxy refers to the group "alkyl-O-", where alkyl is as defined above. By way of non-limiting example, suitable alkoxy groups include methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy and isopropoxy. It will be understood that the invention comprehends the different diastereomers in isolation from each other as well as mixtures. The counter-ions, which compensate the charged forms of the compounds of the present invention, are pharmaceutically acceptable counter-ions such as hydrogen, or more preferably alkali or alkali-earth metals ions, which include sodium, calcium, magnesium and potassium. Other 'compound' group definitions will be readily understandable by the skilled person based on the previous definitions and the usual conventions of nomenclature. It will be appreciated that any optional feature that has been described above in relation to any one aspect of the invention may also be applicable to any other aspect of the invention. In the description of exemplified compounds, "IC50" represents the anti-factor Xa activity. Applications Compounds described here above can be used as a medicament. More in particular, they can be used as medicament intended for the treatment of a blood clotting disorder. Blood clotting disorder are, in particular, one of venous thrombosis or arterial thrombosis, including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, acute coronary syndromes, myocardial infarction and stroke. Blood clotting disorders may also result from atrial fibrillation. The compounds can also be used during ECC (Extracorporeal blood circuit). Therefore it is important that the anticoagulant effect can be inhibited or suppressed.

Preparation of compound 12: Sulfatation The sulphur trioxide-pyridine complex (4.2 mmol, 30 equiv.) was added to a solution of compound 11 (0.14 mmol) in anhydrous pyridine (3 mL).

Biological testing It will be understood that a variety of assays are suitable for testing the biological activity of the compounds of the present invention. However, suitable methods for testing the biological activity of the compounds of the present invention are listed below. Determination of anti-factor Xa activity of compounds (IC 50 ) The compounds of the present invention inhibit blood coagulation factor Xa through activation of antithrombin (AT). The compounds were compared as to their ability of inhibiting factor Xa in the presence of AT under standard conditions. For each compound a curve was plotted representing the inhibition % vs. concentration. The concentration inhibiting 50% of the factor Xa activity (IC50) was determined. A commercially available system was used for this purpose: Stachrom HP kit (Diagnostica Stago). This assay was carried out on a STA Compact (Diagnostica Stago). Quantification of compounds in plasma Rat plasmatic concentration of compounds (µg compound / mL plasma) was determined using a bioassay based on their anti-factor Xa activity (Stachrom HP kit, Diagnostica Stago as described above). This assay was carried out on a STA Compact (Diagnostica Stago). A specific calibration curve was performed with each compound to be quantified in rat plasma. Pharmacokinetic study after intravenous administration (half-life of elimination, T1/2) The pharmacokinetics of the compounds of the present invention were investigated in female Wistar Han rats after intravenous administration. Blood samples were taken at various time points and blood (9 volumes) was mixed with sodium citrate (1 volume) and cooled immediately on ice. The sample was subjected to a centrifugation at 3000 x g for 10 minutes at low temperature (the plasma is typically stable for 24 h at temperature below 8 °C) and stored frozen at -20 °C. Concentation of compound (per mL of plasma) was determined by their anti-factor Xa activity using factor Xa activity as described above. For each compound, the half-life of elimination was calculated from the concentration versus time curve thus obtained. Results Family 1 (R2and R7form a bridge, R4= -NH2and R5= R6) compound OR5/ORb IC50 (nM) T1/2 (h) (Rat) 13h -OMe 99 1.2 ± 0.1 13i -OEt 45 1.5 ± 0.1 13j -OPr 47 1.8 ± 0.1 13k -OBu 34 2.2 ± 0.1 13l -OPent 34 3.2 ± 0.1 Comparison 1 Compound PA01 was synthesized in a similar manner as described by Petitou in WO 99/36428. Compound PA01 has a half-life T1/2 in rat of 3.5 ± 0.3 h and an IC50 activity of 34 nM. Compound PA01 and compound 13h differ in the R4 group: compound (PA01) having an -OMe group and compound 13h having a -NH2 group. When they are compared, it is observed that the half-life of compound 13h is decreased by about 66% with regards to the half-life of compound PA01. A comparison can also be made with compounds 13i to 13l. It should be observed that these compounds all have a half-life shorter than that of compound PA01 while their factor Xa inhibitory activity is preserved. Comparison 2 Compound PA02 was synthesised in a similar manner as described in EP 2 074 131. Compound PA02 has a half-life T1/2 in rat of 4.8 ± 0.5 and an IC50 activity of 108 nM. Compounds 13h to 13l differ from compound PA02 by having an alkyloxy group in the R5 and R6 with a lower number of carbon atoms. The half-lives in rat of compounds 13h to 13k are shorter than that of compounds PA02, going from 1.2 h (-OMe) to 3.2 h (-OPent). Furthermore, anti-factor Xa activity of compounds 13h to 13l is increased in comparison with that of compound PA02, i.e. the IC50 of compounds 13h to 13k is decreased. The IC50 values of compounds 13h to 13l go from 99 nM (-OMe) down to 34 nM (-OBu and -OPent). It should be noted that this restricted selection has yielded compounds with short half-lives in comparison with the compounds of the prior art.

When they are compared, it is observed that the half-life of compound 15h is decreased by about 54% with regards to the half-life of compound PA01. A comparison can also be made with compounds 15a and 15i. It should be observed that these compounds have a half-life shorter than that of compound PA01. Further, compounds 15h, 15i and 15k, display lower IC50 activity and thus are better factor Xa inhibitor than compound PA01. Comparison 4 Compound PA02 and compound 15a differ in the R5 and R6 groups by compound PA02 having a -OHex (hexoxy) group while compound 15a has a -OH group and in the R4 group by compound PA02 having a -NH2 group while compound 15a has a -NH-LC-biotin group. When both are compared, it is observed that the half-life of compound 15a is decreased by about 73% with regards to compound PA02. Compounds 15h to 15k differ from compound PA02 by having an alkyloxy group in the R5 and R6 with a lower number of carbon atoms. The half-lives of compounds 15h to 15k are shorter than that of compounds PA02. Furthermore, activity of compounds 15h to 15k is increased in comparison with that of compound PA02. The IC50 value of compound 15a is 56 nM, while those of compounds 15h to 15i remain under 33 nM. Comparison 5 Compounds of family 1 and of family 3 differ in the R4 group, compounds of Family 1 having a -NH2 group whereas those of Family 3 have a -NH-LC-biotin group. Compounds of Family 3 have a higher anti-factor Xa activity (lower IC50) than compounds of Family 1 while still having acceptable half-life values. Therefore, the grafting of a biotin group on the compounds of Family 1 surprisingly increases the anti-factor Xa activity. Family 4 (R 2 and R 7 form a bridge, R 4 = -NH-LC-biotin and R 5 ≠ R 6 ) compound OR5/OR6 IC50 (nM) T1/2 (h) (Rat) 15b -OH/OMe 42 1.3 ± 0.1 15e -OMe/OH 65 1.3 ± 0.1 15c -OH/OEt 30 2.2 ± 0.2 15f -OEt/OH 50 1.3 ± 0.0 Comparison 6 compounds of Family 2 and of family 4 differ in the R4 group by compounds of Family 2 having a -NH2 group whereas those of Family 4 have a -NH-LC-biotin group. Compounds of Family 4 have a higher anti-factor Xa activity (lower IC50) than compounds of Family 2 while still having acceptable half-life values. Therefore, the grafting of a biotin group on the compounds of Family 2 surprisingly increases the anti-factor Xa activity. Family 5 (R 2 = alcoxy, R 7 = H, R 4 = -NH 2 ) compound OR5/OR6 IC50 (nM) T1/2 (h) (Rat) 17h -OMe/OMe 59 1.2 ± 0.1 17c -OH/OEt 103 1.3 ± 0.1 Family 6 (R2= alcoxy, R7= H, R4= -NH-LC-biotin) compound OR5/OR6 IC50 (nM) T1/2 (h) (Rat) 18a -OH/OH 53 1.9 ± 0.1 18b -OH/OMe 34 2.4 ± 0.1 18e -OMe/OH 55 1.5 ± 0.1 18f -OEt/OH 39 2.3 ± 0.2 18c -OH/OEt 31 1.9 ± 0.2 Comparison 7 When comparing corresponding compounds of Family 5 and family 6, which differ in the R4 group, Family 5 has a -NH2 group whereas those of Family 6 have a -NH-LC-biotin group, the anti-factor Xa activity of the compounds of Family 6 are higher than the anti-factor Xa activity of the compounds of Family 5 while still having acceptable half-life values. Therefore, the grafting of a biotin group on the compounds of Family 5 surprisingly increases the anti-factor Xa activity.
