Actions of nizatidine, a selective histamine H2-receptor antagonist, on gastric acid secretion in dogs, rats and frogs.
Nizatidine (LY139037), a selective histamine H2-receptor antagonist, is a potent inhibitor of gastric acid secretion.
It was 17.8 times as active as cimetidine on histamine (10(-5) M)-induced secretion from the isolated gastric mucosa of the bullfrog.
Nizatidine was 8.9 times as active as cimetidine on basal acid secretion of the chronic gastric fistula rats after s.c. administration.
Against acid secretion from the vagally innervated gastric fistula and Heidenhain pouch of dogs stimulated with submaximal doses of histamine, methacholine and gastrin, nizatidine was, respectively, 6.5, 5 and 4.7 times as active as cimetidine by i.v.
administration.
Nizatidine was very well absorbed from the gut and was 5 to 10 times as active as cimetidine on gastric acid secretion of dogs induced by submaximal and maximal doses of histamine when given p.o.
Equal molar doses of nizatidine showed equal peak effects when given i.v., s.c. or i.m.
Pharmacological data indicate that nizatidine is safe and effective as an agent for the control of excessive gastric acid secretion.
