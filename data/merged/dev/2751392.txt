Developmental changes in lactate dehydrogenase-X activity in young jaundiced male rats.
This study was designed to examine the testicular maturation in both jaundiced (jj) and nonjaundiced (Jj) male Gunn rats as indicated by the activity of a testis and sperm-specific enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase-X (LDH-X), and serum testosterone levels.
Testicular cytosolic LDH-X activity was determined by oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH).
Serum testosterone levels were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA).
Testicular LDH-X activity increased rapidly between 30 and 50 days of age in both Jj and jj Gunn rats.
LDH-X activity was significantly lower in the jj Gunn rats at 50 and 60 days of age.
Testosterone level was significantly lower in the jj Gunn rats at 50 days of age.
LDH-X activity and serum testosterone levels were similar for both genotypes at 180 days of age.
The delay of testicular maturation in the jaundiced males seems to be due to lower LDH-X activity and serum testosterone levels.
