Mutations in the follicle-stimulating hormone-beta (FSH beta) and FSH receptor genes in mice and humans.
Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), a dimeric glycoprotein synthesized in the anterior pituitary gland, is important for the production of sex steroids and gametes.
FSH-beta (FSH beta) and FSH receptor (FSHR) knockout mice display impaired ovarian follicular development and infertility in females and small testes, oligospermia, and fertility in males.
Humans with FSH beta gene mutations tend to have a more severe phenotype than those with FSHR gene mutations, although infertility and varying degrees of impaired sex steroid production occur in both types of mutations.
Data from human and mouse mutations in the FSH beta and FSHR genes suggest that FSH is necessary for normal pubertal development and fertility in males and females.
