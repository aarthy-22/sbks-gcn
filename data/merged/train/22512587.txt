A review on the development in the field of NIDDM based thiazolidinedione PPARγ agonists.
Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors gamma (PPARγ) are a class of ligand activated transcription factors with a prominent role in the regulation of metabolic processes.
The present work aims towards examining the functional and structural features that facilitate the binding of small molecules based on Thiazolidinedione pharmacophore to PPARs.
The intent of this article is to review all the reported thiazolidinediones and associated groups of PPARγ ligands.
