AUSTRALIA Patents Act 1990 COMPLETE SPECIFICATION INNOVATION PATENT PLATE CARRIER The following statement is a full description of the invention, including the best method of performing it known to me: ΐ PLATE CARRIER In the entertainment or catering industries for instance, for the delivery and serving of prepared food or meals, new technology Regen ovens and Cook-Chill style technology is allowing the final preparation of large numbers of meals, ready to serve, in a very short time. It is critical therefore, that the food is delivered from the kitchen to the customer quickly and efficiently. This will minimise the waiting time for the consumer or customer and maximize the delivery capability of the people delivering and serving the food. This is especially important when there are a large number of customers who need to be served simultaneously. Inefficient delivery methods do not allow best practice for staff utilization or high quality customer focus. Current methods of delivery either lack the ability to carry, deliver and serve large numbers easily, quickly and efficiently, or are not adaptable enough to cope with a variety of plate sizes and types. The conventional method of delivery of plates of prepared food is to hand carry the plates, or to carry them on a tray, or to use a carrying device that is limited in its ability to hold a large number of plates at any one time. This results in slow delivery, inefficient service and poor utilisation of serving and waiting staff. The result is inefficiency and poor customer service. It is therefore the primary and preferred object of the invention to provide a plate carrying device that allows the quick and efficient loading, carrying and serving of a large number of plates simultaneously. Typical devices used to carry plates of prepared food have been designed to carry a specific size, shape and design of plate. Each new size, shape and design of plate requires the device to be re-designed and constructed anew. Using an existing device for alternative size, shape and designs does not allow the plates to be carried safely without slipping or tipping during loading, carrying or serving. It is therefore another preferred objective of the invention to provide a device that is able to carry a large variety of size, shape and designed plates, such that the device can be utilised by a very wide variety of service providers in the entertainment and catering industries, without the need for re-design or modification. Typical devices that can carry a variety of plate sizes are limited because of the design and materials used and therefore do not provide an anti-slip surface designed to firmly retain a wide variety of plates. It is therefore another preferred objective of the invention to provide a device that is able to carry a large variety of size and shaped plates without the possibility of slipping within the device while the plates are being carried, delivered and served. Typical devices used to carry pates are limited by the materials used and construction methods. It is therefore another preferred objective of the invention to provide a device such that it is robust, dishwasher safe, meets industry food hygiene standards for the materials used, is easily cleaned and can be cleaned in industrial dishwashers. Broadly the invention comprises a device with a handle that is connected to two rods that run vertically down from the handle. Five, or more as required, plate holders are connected to the two rods laterally and at right angles to the rods such that the plate holders sit horizontally. A third vertical rod is at 90 degrees to the two rods and equidistance from each rod, and connected to the plate holders to form the third connected rod. The three rods and the plate holders are designed to retain the plates in a secure position within the device. The quadrant opposite the third rod is open, allowing the removal and insertion of plates without losing any retention properties of the device as a whole. This fourth quadrant also is shaped to provide the best possible loading access, carrying position and serving access for the staff. The invention may be better understood with reference to the accompanying drawings, which show one example of the invention. The drawings depict the application from a holistic context. In order that the invention may be readily understood and put into practical effect, preferred embodiments are described by way of example with reference to accompanying drawings as stated. Figure 1 is an isometric view of the entire plate carrying device. This figure depicts the invention for clarity, without specifying preferred embodiments. The device is lifted by the handle (1). The handle is connected to the two vertical rods (2). A third rod (3) is connected to the plate holders (4) to provide rigidity and a method of retention of the plates when carried. This Figure also demonstrates that the device can be placed on a horizontal surface and remain stable and upright. There is a cap (5) on the top of the third rod (3) and rubber feet (6) shown on the bottom of all three rods. These feet (6) ensures best stability during the loading and serving phases of the delivery process. Figure 2 is a plan view of the entire plate carrying device showing the relative position of the three vertical rods ((2, 3) and the connections to the plate holders (4). This view also depicts the relative position of the handle (1) such that the device, when carried, is upright with the plate holders horizontally located, ensuring the best plate retention possible. This view also highlights the shaped fourth quadrant (7) which allows the device to be in closer lateral proximity to the legs of the person carrying the device, ensuring ease of carriage and greatest carriage stability. In addition, this view demonstrates the use of shaped and raised nodules (8) that allow carriage of square plates within the same device, without alteration, while maximising the retention and anti-slip properties of the device. These nodules provide fixed points that the comers of plates are retained against. As there are only two sets of four nodules in the trine adjacent to the fourth quadrant, they slightly elevate the plate in that trine and provide even greater plate lateral stability and plate anti-slip properties for the device. Figure 3 is a close up isometric view of the top handle (1) and two plate holders (4) clearly demonstrating the curved plate holder design which provides excellent plate retention for a large variety of plate size, shape and design. Also evident is the centre opening (9) of the plate holder, which is large enough to accommodate a wide variety of plates and their under side shape and design, including ridging, which is typical of most varieties of plates in use in the industry. This figure clearly demonstrates the concave shape of the plate holders (4), providing excellent plate retention and stability. Also evident are the sets of raised nodules (8) that enhance the anti-slip properties and increase the lateral stability while providing excellent retention for plates of different shape, size and design. Figure 4 is an isometric view of the entire device with a typical circular plate in location on each plate holder. Figure 5 is an isometric view of the entire device with a typical square plate in location on each plate holder, clearly demonstrating the devices’ ability to carry plates and various size, shape and design. It is readily apparent to the skilled observer that the present invention provides a plate carrying device therefore, which has many advantages over the prior arrangements. Various changes and modifications may be made to the embodiments described and illustrated without departing from the present invention defined in the appended claims.
