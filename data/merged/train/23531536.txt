The Protective Effects of α-Lipoic Acid on Kidneys in Type 2 Diabetic Goto-Kakisaki Rats via Reducing Oxidative Stress.
To evaluate the protective effects of α-lipoic acid on the kidneys of Goto-Kakisaki (GK) diabetic rats, ten GK diabetic rats were randomly divided into a diabetic control group and a lipoic acid-treated diabetic group with α-lipoic acid 35 mg·Kg-1 intraperitoneal injections.
Four healthy Wistar rats served as normal controls.
Malonaldehyde (MDA), ascorbic acid (vitamin C), vitamin E, glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels in renal homogenate, and urine protein excretion were measured.
The expression of mRNA for NF-κB, NADPH oxidase subunits p22phox and p47phox in renal tissue was examined by realtime PCR.
Pathological changes in renal tissue were evaluated by light and electron microscopy.
There were significant increases in urine protein excretion, MDA levels and the expression of mRNA of NF-κB, p22phox and p47phox, and significant decreases in GSH, SOD, vitamin C and vitamin E levels in the diabetic control group compared with the normal control group.
Pathological changes of renal tissue were more progressive in the diabetic control group than in the normal control group.
All the parameters above were improved in the α-lipoic acid-treated diabetic group.
Oxidative stress is increased in the kidney of type 2 diabetic GK rats.
It is associated with the progression of diabetic nephropathy.
α-lipoic acid can protect renal function in diabetic rats via its antioxidant activity.
