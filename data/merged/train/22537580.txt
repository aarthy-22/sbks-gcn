Two new C-15 enolic acyl phragmalin-type limonoids from Chukrasia tabularis var. velutina.
Two new C-15 enolic acyl phragmalin-type limonoid orthoesters, chukvelutilide G (1) and chukrasine F (2), were isolated from the stem barks of Chukrasia tabularis var.
velutina.
Their structures were elucidated by their extensive high resolution-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS), one- and two-dimensional spectroscopic analysis, including heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC), HMBC and NOESY experiments.
