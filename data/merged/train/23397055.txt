Impaired function of prejunctional adenosine A1 receptors expressed by perivascular sympathetic nerves in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats.
Increased sympathetic nervous system activity contributes to deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertension in rats.
ATP and norepinephrine (NE) are coreleased from perivascular sympathetic nerves.
NE acts at prejunctional α2-adrenergic receptors (α2ARs) to inhibit NE release, and α2AR function is impaired in DOCA-salt rats.
Adenosine, an enzymatic ATP degradation product, acts at prejunctional A1 adenosine receptors (A1Rs) to inhibit NE release.
We tested the hypothesis that prejunctional A1R function is impaired in sympathetic nerves supplying mesenteric arteries (MAs) and veins (MVs) of DOCA-salt rats.
Electrically evoked NE release and constrictions of blood vessels were studied in vitro with use of amperometry to measure NE oxidation currents and video microscopy, respectively.
Immunohistochemical methods were used to localize tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and A1Rs in perivascular sympathetic nerves.
TH and A1Rs colocalized to perivascular sympathetic nerves.
Adenosine and N(6)-cyclopentyl-adenosine (CPA, A1R agonist) constricted MVs but not MAs.
Adenosine and CPA (0.001-10 µM) inhibited neurogenic constrictions and NE release in MAs and MVs.
DOCA-salt arteries were resistant to adenosine and CPA-mediated inhibition of NE release and constriction.
The A2A adenosine receptor agonist CGS21680 (C23H29N7O6.HCl.xH2O) (0.001-0.1 μM) did not alter NE oxidation currents.
We conclude that there are prejunctional A1Rs in arteries and both pre- and postjunctional A1Rs in veins; thus, adenosine selectively constricts the veins.
Prejunctional A1R function is impaired in arteries, but not veins, from DOCA-salt rats.
Sympathetic autoreceptor dysfunction is not specific to α2ARs, but there is a more general disruption of prejunctional mechanisms controlling sympathetic neurotransmitter release in DOCA-salt hypertension.
