Cytotoxic and Anti-Inflammatory Eunicellin-Based Diterpenoids from the Soft Coral Cladiella krempfi.
Five new eunicellin-based diterpenoids, krempfielins E-I (1-5) and seven known compounds (6-12) were isolated from the organic extract of a Taiwanese soft coral Cladiella krempfi.
The structures of the new metabolites were elucidated on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analysis.
Metabolites 5, 6, 10 and 12 were shown to exhibit cytotoxicity against a limited panel of cancer cell lines.
Furthermore, compounds 6 and 10 could potently inhibit the accumulation of the pro-inflammatory iNOS protein, and 6 and 12 could significantly reduce the expression of COX-2 protein in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage cells.
