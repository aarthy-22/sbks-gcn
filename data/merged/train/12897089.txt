Oxidative stress-related factors in Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes: relevance for angiotensin II signalling.
BACKGROUND: Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes (BS/GS) have a blunted Gq protein-mediated cell signalling despite high circulating angiotensin II (Ang II) levels.
This is associated with reduced Galphaq gene expression, intracellular inositol trisphosphate and Ca(++) release, PKC activity and cell reactivity.
Ang II is a powerful stimulator of vascular oxidases but BS/GS patients show reduced total volatile LDL oxidation products and reduced LDL susceptibility to oxidation suggesting low level of oxidative stress.
Therefore, we evaluated oxidative stress-related proteins in plasma and monocytes of patients with BS/GS, at baseline and after Ang II stimulation.
METHODS: In two BS and seven GS patients, biochemically and genetically characterized, and in 10 age- and sex-matched control subjects, we measured total plasma antioxidant power (AOP), plasma peroxynitrite level and gene expression of the NADH/NADPH oxidase subunit p22(phox), TGFbeta and haeme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in circulating monocytes in basal condition and after stimulation with Ang II.
Furthermore, we investigated the C(242)T polymorphism of p22(phox), whose topography in a potential haeme-binding site suggests a role in the regulation of oxidative stress.
RESULTS: AOP was higher in BS/GS patients than in controls (3.27 +/- 0.95 mmol/l vs 1.05 +/- 0.16, P = 0.002), together with higher plasma renin activity and aldosterone level (9.88 +/- 4.64 vs 0.95 +/- 0.08 nmol Ang I/h/ml, P < 0.0001; and 0.73 +/- 0.13 vs 0.18 +/- 0.01 nmol/l, P < 0.0001, respectively).
The plasma peroxynitrite level was undetectable both in patients and controls.
mRNA expression of p22(phox) and TGFbeta was reduced in BS/GS patients compared to controls [0.35 +/- 0.08 vs 0.53+/-0.05 densitometric units (d.u.), P = 0.005, and 0.82 +/- 0.07 vs 1.15 +/-
0.25 d.u., P = 0.006, respectively].
HO-1 mRNA was increased in BS/GS patients in comparison to controls (0.88 +/- 0.07 vs 0.78 +/- 0.11 d.u., P = 0.037).
After acute Ang II exposure, p22(phox), TGFbeta and HO-1 gene expression significantly increased only in controls (from 0.59 +/- 0.12 to 0.96 +/- 0.11, P < 0.001, from 0.97 +/- 0.1 to 1.27 +/-
0.22, P < 0.008, and from 0.62 +/- 0.1 to 0.82 +/-
0.09, P < 0.001, respectively).
Finally, C(242)T polymorphism of p22(phox) was undetectable.
CONCLUSIONS: The intracellular responses to Ang II mediated by reactive oxygen species are reduced in BS/GS patients.
This may contribute to their vascular hyporeactivity.
