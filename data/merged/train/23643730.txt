Juglone, isolated from Juglans mandshurica Maxim, induces apoptosis via down-regulation of AR expression in human prostate cancer LNCaP cells.
Juglone is a natural compound which has been isolated from Juglans mandshurica Maxim.
Recent studies have shown that juglone had various pharmacological effects such as anti-viral, anti-bacterial and anti-cancer.
However, its anti-cancer activity on human prostate cancer LNCaP cell has not been examined.
Thus, the current study was designed to elucidate the molecular mechanism of apoptosis induced by juglone in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer LNCaP cells.
MTT assay was performed to examine the anti-proliferative effect of juglone.
Occurrence of apoptosis was detected by Hoechst 33342 staining and flow cytometry in LNCaP cells treated with juglone for 24h.
The result shown that juglone inhibited the growth of LNCaP cells in a dose-dependent manner.
Morphological changes of apoptotic body formation after juglone treatment were observed by Hoechst 33342 staining.
This apoptotic induction was associated with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and caspase-3, -9 activation.
Moreover, we found that juglone significantly inhibited the expression levels of androgen receptor (AR) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in a dose-dependent manner, as well as abrogated up-regulation of AR and PSA genes with and/or without dihydrotestosterone (DHT).
Take together, our results demonstrated that juglone might induce the apoptosis in LNCaP cell via down-regulation of AR expression.
Therefore, our results indicated that juglone may be a potential candidate of drug for androgen-sensitive prostate cancer.
