The effects of gender difference on monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension in rats.
The present study aimed to compare the effect of gender difference on hemodynamic consequences in the development of monocrotaline (MCT)-induced pulmonary hypertension in rat.
The effect of antioxidant enzyme systems on the development of pulmonary hypertension mediated by the phytotoxin MCT and the effect of gender on these antioxidant systems were also investigated.
For this purpose, the right ventricular pressures (RVPs) and right ventricular/heart weight (HW) ratios were compared between groups and the glutathione (GSH) level and superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities were determined
in lung and liver tissue samples of rats.
RVP and right ventricular/HW ratios significantly increased in the MCT group compared to the control group.
In the MCT group, RVP was significantly higher in males than females.
MCT-induced pulmonary hypertension resulted in decreased GSH level, decreased GST and SOD activities and increased CAT activity in lung and liver tissues of both male and female rats.
In addition, the lung and liver GSH level and GST and SOD levels were higher in female control rats compared to male control rats.
The results of the present study, that antioxidant enzyme activities were different between the groups, highlight the possible role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of MCT-induced pulmonary hypertension in rats.
Moreover, the lower antioxidant defense capacity of male rats than female rats may be considered as a cause of more aggressive course of MCT-induced pulmonary hypertension in males compared to females.
