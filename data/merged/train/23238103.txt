Age dependent differences in the regulation of hippocampal steroid hormones and receptor genes: relations to motivation and cognition in male rats.
Estrogen and estrogenic functions are age-dependently involved in the modulation of learning, memory and mood in female humans and animals.
However, the investigation of estrogenic effects in males has been largely neglected.
Therefore, we investigated the hippocampal gene expression of estrogen receptors α and β (ERα, β) in 8-week-old, 12-week-old and 24-week-old male rats.
To control for possible interactions between the expression of the estrogen receptor genes and other learning-related steroid receptors, androgen receptors (AR), corticosterone-binding glucocorticoid receptors (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) were also measured.
Furthermore, the concentrations of the ligands 17β-estradiol, testosterone and corticosterone were measured.
The spatial training was conducted in a hole-board.
The 8-week-old rats exhibited higher levels of general activity and exploration during the training and performed best with respect to spatial learning and memory, whereas no difference was found between the 12-week-old and 24-week-old rats.
The trained 8-week-old rats exhibited increased gene expression of ERα compared with the untrained rats in this age group as well as the trained 12-week-old and 24-week-old rats.
The concentrations of estradiol and testosterone, however, were generally higher in the 24-week-old rats than in the 8-week-old and 12-week-old rats.
The ERα mRNA concentrations correlated positively with behavior that indicate general learning motivation.
These results suggest a specific role of ERα in the age-related differences in motivation and subsequent success in the task.
Thus, estrogen and estrogenic functions may play a more prominent role in young male behavior and development than has been previously assumed.
