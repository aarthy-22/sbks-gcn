The Androgen Metabolite, 5α-Androstane-3β,17β-Diol (3β-Diol), Activates the Oxytocin Promoter Through an Estrogen Receptor-β Pathway.
Testosterone has been shown to suppress the acute stress-induced activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; however, the mechanisms underlying this response remain unclear.
The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is regulated by a neuroendocrine subpopulation of medial parvocellular neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN).
These neurons are devoid of androgen receptors (ARs).
Therefore, a possibility is that the PVN target neurons respond to a metabolite in the testosterone catabolic pathway via an AR-independent mechanism.
The dihydrotestosterone metabolite, 5α-androstane-3β,17β-diol (3β-diol), binds and activates estrogen receptor-β (ER-β), the predominant ER in the PVN.
In the PVN, ER-β is coexpressed with oxytocin (OT).
Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that 3β-diol regulates OT expression through ER-β activation.
Treatment of ovariectomized rats with estradiol benzoate or 3β-diol for 4 days increased OT mRNA selectively in the midcaudal, but not rostral PVN compared with vehicle-treated controls.
3β-Diol treatment also increased OT mRNA in the hypothalamic N38 cell line in vitro.
The functional interactions between 3β-diol and ER-β with the human OT promoter were examined using an OT promoter-luciferase reporter construct (OT-luc).
In a dose-dependent manner, 3β-diol treatment increased OT-luc activity when cells were cotransfected with ER-β, but not ER-α.
The 3β-diol-induced OT-luc activity was reduced by deletion of the promoter region containing the composite hormone response element (cHRE).
Point mutations of the cHRE also prevented OT-luc activation by 3β-diol.
These results indicate that 3β-diol induces OT promoter activity via ER-β-cHRE interactions.
