Complexity in influenza virus targeted drug design: interaction with human sialidases.
With the global spread of the pandemic H1N1 and the ongoing pandemic potential of the H5N1 subtype, the influenza virus represents one of the most alarming viruses spreading worldwide.
The influenza virus sialidase is an effective drug target, and a number of inhibitors are clinically effective against the virus (zanamivir, oseltamivir, peramivir).
Here we report structural and biochemical studies of the human cytosolic sialidase Neu2 with influenza virus sialidase-targeting drugs and related compounds.
