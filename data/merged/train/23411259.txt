A water-alcohol extract of Citrus grandis whole fruits has beneficial metabolic effects in the obese Zucker rats fed with high fat/high cholesterol diet.
Epidemiological studies suggest that citrus fruits and compounds such as flavonoids, limonoids and pectins have health promoting effects.
Our aim was to study the effects of Citrus grandis (L.) Osbeck var.
tomentosa hort.
fruit extract on the energy metabolism.
A whole fruit powder from dry water and alcohol extracts of C. grandis containing 19% naringin flavonoid was prepared.
The effects of the citrus extract were followed in the obese Zucker rats fed with the HFD.
The circulatory levels of GLP-1 decreased significantly by the extract in comparison to the HFD group, whereas the decreased ghrelin levels were reversed.
The levels of PYY were decreased in all HFD groups.
The leptin amounts decreased but not significantly whereas insulin and amylin were unchanged.
The cholesterol and glucose levels were somewhat but not systematically improved in the HFD fed rats.
Further studies are needed to identify the active compounds and their mechanisms.
