Tricycloalternarenes F-H: three new mixed terpenoids produced by an endolichenic fungus Ulocladium sp. using OSMAC method.
Three new mixed terpenoids, tricycloalternarenes (TCAs) F-H (1-3), together with ten known tricycloalternarenes (4-13), were isolated from the Czapek's culture of an endophytic fungus Ulocladium sp. Their structures were identified by extensive spectroscopic experiments (NMR and MS) and comparison with literature data.
TCA 1b (5) showed weak activity against the Bacille Calmette-Guerin strain with the MIC of 125μg/mL. TCA 9b (10) exhibited strong cytotoxic activity against Hela cell line with IC50 of 8.58μM.
