DETAILED DESCRIPTION Embodiments of the invention relate to grain incomplete filling 1 (GIF1) proteins and genes and their uses in improving grain filling, seed sizes, and grain yields in crops. GIF1 genes encode cell wall invertases in various plants. Embodiments of the invention, for example, relate to the use of GIF1 proteins from Arabidopsis (AtGIF1, or ATCWINV1), rice (OsGIF1, or OsCIN2) and maize (ZmGIF1, ZmCWIN2; also know as Mn1) in the improvement of grain fillings, seed sizes and grain yields of these plants and similar crops. In most agriculturally important plants, carbohydrate is distributed through the sieve element system to the sink organs in the form of sucrose, the end product of photosynthesis in source organs. In the sink organs, sucrose is cleaved, by invertase or sucrose synthetase, to monomers that are used to synthesize carbohydrate polymers (e.g., starch), which are the storage forms of photosynthesis products. The inventors of the present invention discovered that GIF1 genes can control crop grain fillings. Non-expression or lowered expression of these genes would significantly interfere with crop grain fillings, reduce seed weights, and crop yields. Comparatively, enhanced expression of these genes could facilitate crop grain fillings and increase seed weights and crop yields. These genes were cloned and named GIF1 genes (Grain Incomplete Filling 1). Investigations confirmed that normal expression of GIF1 in wild-type plants led to normal growth of crop grains, while mutation of GIF1 causing nonexpression of the GIF1 proteins would result in poor crop qualities, low seed vigor, and poor resistance towards storage diseases. Importantly, these features were notably improved in transgenic crops with enhanced expression of GIF1 proteins. Based on the aforementioned findings, the current invention has been completed. As used herein, “crop” refers to, but not limited to, Graminae, Brassicaceae (Cruciferae), Fabaceae (Leguminosae), Malvaceae, Chenopodiacea, Asteraceae, Myyrtaceae, Salicaceae, and xylophyta, and the like. Preferably, crops includes, but not limited to, rice, wheat, barley, maize, broomcorn, soybean, cotton, canola, sugar beet, alfalfa, rye, sorghum, sugarcane, sunflower, oilseed rape (rapeseed), vegetables, Eucalyptus, poplar, etc. As used herein, the term “isolated” refers to a substance which has been isolated from the original environment. For naturally occurring substance, the original environment is the natural environment. e.g., the polynucleotide and polypeptide in a naturally occurring state in the viable cells are not isolated or purified. However, if the same polynucleotide and polypeptide have been isolated from other components naturally accompanying them, they are isolated or purified. As used herein, “GIF1” refers to grain incomplete filling 1. Analogs of these genes are found in common crops. “GIF1 gene” and “GIF1 protein” refer to the corresponding gene and protein, respectively. They may be referred to as “GIF1” without regard to the source. Alternatively, they may be referred to as, for example, AtGIF1, OsGIF1, or ZmGIF1, based on their sources from Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa (rice), and Zea mays (maize), respectively. As used herein, “isolated GIF1 protein” or “isolated GIF1 polypeptide” refers to an GIF1 protein that does not exist in the natural environment, which includes a completely purified GIF1 protein. Substantively purified GIF1 protein contains almost no naturally relevant proteins, lipids, saccharides, or other substances. The GIF1 proteins could be purified by those skilled in the art using standard protein purification techniques. A purified polypeptide forms a single main band on a non-reductive PAGE gel. Polypeptides of the present invention can be recombinant polypeptides, natural polypeptides, or synthetic polypeptides, preferably recombinant polypeptides. Polypeptides of the present invention may be purified natural products or chemically synthetic products. Alternatively, they may be produced from prokaryotic or eukaryotic hosts, such as bacteria, yeast, higher plant, insect, and mammalian cells, using recombinant techniques. According to the hosts used in the recombinant production, the polypeptides may be glycosylated or non-glycosylated. Polypeptides of the present invention could bear or not bear the initial methionine residues. The invention further comprises fragments, derivatives or analogues of GIF1. As used herein, the term “fragment,” “derivative” or “analogue” mean a polypeptide that essentially retains the same biological functions or activity of GIF1 protein. Based on the following descriptions and examples, one having ordinary skill in the art could easily determine whether the polypeptides have the same biological functions or activities as the GIF1 proteins. A polypeptide fragment, derivative or analogue of the present invention could be (i) a polypeptide with one or more amino acid residues deleted or inserted, or one or more conserved or non-conserved amino acid residue (preferably conserved amino acid residue) being substituted, wherein the substituted amino acid residues could be encoded or not encoded by the genetic codes; or (ii) a polypeptide with one or more amino acid residues including substituted groups; or (iii) one in which a mature polypeptide is fused with another compound, such as a compound to increase the half-life of the polypeptide (for example, polyethylene glycol), or (iv) one in which the additional amino acids, such as a leader or secretary sequence or a sequence used for purifying polypeptide or pro-protein, are fused to the polypeptide. Such fragments, derivatives and analogs are known to the artisans based on the teachings herein. As used herein, the term “OsGIF1 protein” refers to a polypeptide with the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 and OsGIF1 protein activity. The term “AtGIF1 protein” refers to a polypeptide with the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 7 and AtGIF1 protein activity. the term “ZmGIF1 protein” refers to a polypeptide with the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 10 and ZmGIF1 protein activity.

For example, protein functions are usually unaltered when substituted with amino acids of similar or analogous characteristics. Furthermore, protein functions are usually unaltered following addition of one or more amino acids at the C-terminal and/or N-terminal.

The polynucleotides may be in the form of DNA or RNA. DNA may include cDNA, genomic DNA or synthetic DNA. DNA may be single-stranded or double-stranded. DNA may be a coding strand or a non-coding strand. Sequence of the coding region that encodes mature polypeptide of OsGIF1 may be the same as in ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 3, or is a degenerate variant thereof. As used herein, a “degenerate variant” of OsGIF1 refers to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a protein of SEQ ID NO: 2, but contains a coding region that is different from the coding region shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 3. Sequence of the coding region that encodes mature polypeptide of AtGIF1 may be the same as in ID NO: 6 or SEQ ID NO: 8, or is a degenerate variant thereof. As used herein, a “degenerate variant” of AtGIF1 refers to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a protein of SEQ ID NO: 7, contains a coding region that is different from the coding region as shown in SEQ ID NO: 6 or SEQ ID NO: 8. Sequence of the coding region that encodes mature polypeptide of ZmGIF1 may be the same as in ID NO: 9 or SEQ ID NO: 11, or is a degenerate variant thereof. As used herein, a “degenerate variant” of ZmGIF1 refers to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a protein of SEQ ID NO: 10, contains a coding region that is different from the coding region as shown in SEQ ID NO: 9 or SEQ ID NO: 11. Polynucleotides encoding the polypeptides of SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:7, or SEQ ID NO:10 may include those encoding the mature polypeptides, those encoding mature polypeptides and various additional encoding sequences, those encoding mature polypeptides (and optional additional encoding sequences) and non-encoding sequences. The term a “polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide” may be a polynucleotide that encodes the polypeptide. It may also include polynucleotide with an additional encoding sequence and/or non-encoding sequence. The invention also relates to the variants of the aforementioned polynucleotides, encoding the polypeptides having the same amino acid sequences as described herein, or their fragments, analogues, and derivatives. The variants of the polynucleotides may be naturally occurring allelic variants or non-naturally occurring variants. Such nucleotide variants may include substitution variants, deletion variants, and/or insertion variants. As known in the art, an allelic variant is a substituted form of a polynucleotide, within which one or more nucleotides may be substituted, deleted and/or inserted without substantially altering the function of the encoded polypeptide. The invention also relates to polynucleotides that may hybridize with the aforementioned sequences, wherein the two sequences have a sequence identity of at least 50%, preferably at least 60%, preferably at least 65%, preferably at least 70%, more preferably at least 75%, more preferably at least 80%, and more preferably at least 90%, most preferably at least 95%. The invention specifically relates to polynucleotides that may hybridize with the polynucleotides of the invention under stringent conditions. “Stringent conditions” as used herein refers to (1) hybridization and elution at relatively low ionic strength and high temperature, such as 0.2×SSC, 0.1% SDS, and 60° C.; or (2) hybridization in the presence of denaturant, such as 50% (v/v) formamide, 0.1% calf serum/0.1% Ficoll, 42° C., etc; or (3) hybridization only when sequence identity between the two sequences was at least above 85%, preferably above 90%, preferably above 95%. In addition, the hybridizable polynucleotides encoded polypeptides share the same biological functions and activities as the mature polypeptides. The invention also relates to nucleic acid fragments that may hybridize with the aforementioned sequences. As used herein, the length of a “nucleic acid fragment” is at least 15 nucleotides, preferably at least 30 nucleotides, more preferably at least 50 nucleotides, most preferably at least 100 nucleotides. The nucleic acid fragments can be used in amplifying techniques of nucleic acids (e.g. PCR) to determine and/or isolate the GIF1 protein-encoding polynucleotides. It should be understood that although the GIF1 genes in the invention are obtained from rice, maize, Arabidopsis, and the like, genes from other crops having high homology (e.g. above 50%, such as above 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, even 95% sequence identity) with these GIF1 genes are also included within the scope of the invention. Methods and tools for identifying the sequence homology are known in the art, such as BLAST. Following the discovery of these GIF1 genes, the inventors also succeeded in discovering highly homologous genes in other crops such as AF030420 gene in wheat, AJ534447 gene in barley, and X69321 gene in carrot, using BLAST. The applications of these highly homologous genes in crop grain filling, sugar metabolic regulation and accumulation, and crop improvement are also included within the protected scope of the invention. Full-length sequences of the GIF1 nucleotides or their fragments can be prepared by PCR amplifications, recombinations or synthetic methods. For PCR amplification, one can obtain said sequences by designing primers based on the nucleotide sequences disclosed herein, especially the ORF, and using cDNA library commercially available or prepared by routine techniques in the art as templates. When the sequences are long, it is usually necessary to perform two or more PCR amplifications and link the amplified fragments together correctly. Once the sequences are obtained, one can produce lots of the sequences by recombinant methods. Usually, said sequences may be cloned into vectors which may be then transformed into host cells. The sequences may be isolated from the amplified host cells using conventional techniques. Further, the sequences can be synthesized, especially when the fragments are short. Typically, several small fragments may be synthesized and linked together to obtain a long sequence. It is completely feasible to chemically synthesize the DNA sequences encoding the protein of invention, or the fragments or derivatives thereof. The DNA sequence can thereafter be introduced into various available DNA molecules (or vectors) and cells in the art. In addition, mutations can be introduced into the protein sequences by chemical synthesis. This invention also relates to vectors containing the polynucleotides of the invention, the host cells obtained from the vectors or GIF1 encoding sequences of the invention via genetic engineering, and the methods for obtaining the polypeptides of the invention using recombinant techniques. Using conventional DNA recombinant techniques (Science, 1984; 224:1431), the polynucleotide sequences of the invention can be used to express or produce recombinant GIF1 proteins. Generally, it comprises the following steps: (1) transfecting or transforming appropriate host cells with a polynucleotide (or a variant) encoding GIF1 polypeptide or a vector containing the polynucleotide;(2) culturing the host cells in an appropriate medium;(3) isolating or purifying the protein from the medium or cells. The GIF1 polynucleotide sequences in the invention can be inserted into recombinant expression vectors. The term “recombinant expression vector” refers to a bacterium plasmid, phage, yeast plasmid, virus of plant cell, virus of mammalian cell or other vectors known in the art. Any plasmid or vector can be used as long as it is capable of replicating and is stable in the host. As an important characteristic, an expression vector usually contains an origin of replication, promoter, a marker gene and a translation regulation element. Methods known by those skilled in the art can be used for the construction of expression vectors containing the DNA sequences encoding GIF1 proteins and proper transcription/translation regulation elements. These methods include in vitro recombinant DNA techniques, DNA synthesis techniques, in vivo recombinant techniques, and so on. The DNA sequences may be effectively linked to a proper promoter in the expression vector to direct the synthesis of mRNA. The expression vector may also include a ribosome binding site for initiating translation and a transcription terminator. Furthermore, the expression vectors preferably include one or more selective marker genes, which provide a phenotype for selecting transformed host cells, such as dihydrofolate reductase, neomycin resistance, and green fluorescence protein (GFP) for eukaryotic cell culture, and kanamycin as well as ampicillin resistance for E. coli. The vectors that contain aforementioned proper DNA sequences, promoter or regulation sequences can be transformed into appropriate host cells to express the proteins. The hose cells can be prokaryotic cells, such as bacterium cells; or lower eukaryotic cells, such as yeast cells; or higher eukaryotic cells, such as plant cells. Typical examples are E. coli, Streptomyces, Agrobacterium tumefaciens; fungus cells such as yeast; plant cells, etc. When the polynucleotides of the invention are expressed in higher eukaryotic cells, insertion of an enhancer sequence in the vector can enhance transcription. Enhancer is a DNA cis-acting element with about 10-300 bp, which acts on the promoter to enhance gene transcription. Artisans in the art know how to select proper vectors, promoters, enhancers and host cells. Transformation of host cells with recombinant DNA may be performed using conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art. When the host is a prokaryote, such as E. coli, competent cells capable of DNA uptake, can be prepared from cells harvested after exponential growth phase and subsequently treated by the CaCl2 method using known procedures. Another method includes the use of MgCl2. Transformation can also be performed through electroporation when necessary. When the host is an eukaryote, DNA transfection methods, including calcium phosphate co-precipitation, conventional mechanical methods such as microinjection, electroporation, or liposome encapsulation, may be used. Plant transformation may also use the method of Agrobacterium tumefaciens transformation or particle gun transformation, such as the leaf disc method, rice immature embryo transformation method, etc. Transformed plant cells, tissues and organs can be regenerated to plants to obtain a plant with an improved grain filling ability or grain quality. The obtained transformants may be cultured using conventional methods to express the polypeptides encoded by the genes of the invention. Culture medium may be selected from various conventional culture media based on the host cells used. When the host cells have grown to a proper density, the selected promoter may be induced using appropriate methods (such as temperature transformation or chemical induction), followed by incubation for an additional period of time. The recombinant polypeptides in the aforementioned methods may be expressed intracellularly or on the cell membranes, or secreted to the outside the cells. If necessary, the recombinant proteins may be isolated and purified using various isolation techniques according to its physical, chemical or other characteristics. These techniques are known to those skilled in the art. Examples of the techniques include, but are not limited to, conventional renaturation treatment, treatment with protein precipitator (saltingout), centrifugation, cell lysis by osmosis, ultra-treatment, ultracentrifugation, size-exclusion chromatography (gel filtration), absorption chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), other liquid chromatography techniques or a combination thereof. The recombinant GIF1 proteins or polypeptides may be subject to various applications, including screening of antibodies, polypeptides or other ligands that enhance or inhibit the GIF1 protein functions. Screening polypeptide banks using expressed recombinant GIF1 proteins can be used to find valuable polypeptide molecules that are capable of inhibiting or stimulating GIF1 protein functions. Polynucleotides of the invention may be partly or entirely fixed on a microassay or DNA chip (also termed as “gene chip”) as a probe for the differential expression analysis of genes in tissues. Transcription product of GIF1 proteins may also be tested by in vitro amplification of RT-PCR with GIF1 specific primers. The invention also relates to methods for improving crops, wherein the methods may comprise enhancing the expression of GIF1 genes or their homologous genes in the crops. The methods for enhancing the expression of GIF1 genes or their homologous genes are known to those skilled in the art, such as driving the expression of GIF1 genes using strong promoters. Enhancer (such as the first intron of rice waxy gene, and the first intron of Actin gene) may be alternatively used to enhance the expression of GIF1 genes. Strong promoters suitable for the methods of the invention include, but not limited to, 35S promoter, Ubi promoters of rice and maize, etc. As a preferred embodiment of the invention, a method for improving crops may comprise the followings steps: (1) providing Agrobacterium tumefaciens harboring an expression vector, wherein the expression vector comprises a DNA sequence encoding a GIF1 protein; (2) contacting a plant a cell, a tissue or an organ with the Agrobacterium tumefaciens of step (1), to allow for transfection of said DNA sequence encoding the GIF1 protein into the plant cell, tissue, or organ, and to allow for integration into the host chromosome; (3) selecting the plant cell, tissue or organ transfected with the DNA sequence encoding the GIF1 protein; (4) regenerating the plant cell, tissue or organ of step (3) into a plant. Any appropriate conventional means, including reagents, temperature, pressure condition, etc, may be used for the application of the methods. Moreover, the invention also relates to applications of the crop grain filling traits as tracing labels for transgenic plant offspring. Furthermore, the grain filling traits of said genes may also be applied as indication labels for the eu-hybrids during breeding by crossing. In one example of the invention, an OsGIF1 gene having a genome sequence of 6840 bp (SEQ ID NO: 3) was presented. The ORF was located at 2380-2594, 3723-4605, 4994-5152, 5903-6168, 6276-6364, 6651-6840, and the total cDNA (SEQ ID NO: 1) was 1797 bp, which encoded a protein (SEQ ID NO: 2) comprising 598 amino acids. The OsGIF1 gene can be used to provide novel approaches for improving crop varieties, and therefore exhibits a profound potential for practical application. In one example of the invention, an AtGIF1 gene having a genome sequence of 2957 bp (SEQ ID NO: 8) was presented. The total cDNA (SEQ ID NO: 6) was 1755 bp, which encoded a protein (SEQ ID NO: 2) comprising 584 amino acids. The AtGIF1 gene can be used to provide novel approaches for improving crop varieties, and therefore exhibits a profound potential for practical application. In one example of the invention, a ZmGIF1 gene having a genome sequence of 4412 bp (SEQ ID NO: 11) was presented. The total cDNA (SEQ ID NO: 9) was 1782 bp, which encoded a protein (SEQ ID NO: 10) comprising 593 amino acids. The ZmGIF1 gene can be used to provide novel approaches for improving crop varieties, and therefore exhibits a profound potential for practical application. Advantages of the present invention may include: (1) it is the first time to isolate and obtain a novel crop grain filling gene GIF1, which is capable of dominating grain filling and controlling crop quality. (2) crop grain filling gene GIF1 serves as a gene for dominating crop grain filling and enhancing crop yield as well as quality, and is applied to varietal improvement. Embodiments of the invention may be further illustrated by the following examples. It is appreciated that these examples are only intended to illustrate the invention, but not to limit the scope of the invention. For the experimental methods in the following examples, they may be performed under routine conditions, e.g., those described by Sambrook et. al., in Molecule Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, New York: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989, methods reported in PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual by Carl W. Dieffenbach and Gabriela S. Devksler eds. (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1995), or as instructed by the manufacturers, unless otherwise specified. Materials and Methods 1. Cloning and transformation of pCAMBIA1301-OsGIF1 OsGIF1 was digested by restriction enzymes Mun1 and BamH1, and was thereafter ligated to BamHI and EcoRI digested pBluescript sk+ (Stratagene). The clone produced was further digested by Hind III and Bam HI, and was cloned to equally digested pCAMBIA1301 (cf. http://www.bios.net/daisy/cambia/585.html#dsy585_gus_intron) to obtain pCAMBIA1301-OsGIF1. Transformation of pCAMBIA1301-OsGIF1 into Agrobacterium tumefaciens was carried out using the following protocol: 1. add 1 μg of pCAMBIA1301-OsGIF1 plasmid to competent cells of Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA 105 (Hood, E. E., Gelvin, S. B., Melchers, L. S, and Hoekema, A., Transgenic Res., 1993, 2, 208-218) and incubate on ice for 30 min; 2. freeze the cells by liquid nitrogen for 1 min; 3. thaw frozen cells in 37° C. water; 4. add 1 mL of YEP and incubate at 28° C. for 2-4 h; 5. spread 200 μl of the above suspension on antibiotics-containing YEP plates; 6. incubate the plates for 2 days at 28° C. until positive colonies are observed and select the positive colonies. 2. Induction and Transformation of the Calli of Rice Mature Embryos Hulls of ZH11 and mutant (Osgif1) seeds were removed. The seeds were immersed in 70% ethanol for 1 min, and then in 20% (v/v) NaClO for 20 min with shaking. They were then washed with sterilized water for 5-6 times to yield ivory white grains without abnormal smell. Excessive water was blotted with aseptic filter paper, and the calli were induced on the NBD/N6 culture medium. After being cultured in dark at 26° C. for 1 week, the calli were peeled off, and the endosperm, embryo and radicel were collected. The calli were subcultured in dark on the NBD/N6 culture medium (Sigma), and were passaged every 2-3 weeks as receptors. 3. Agrobacterium-Mediated Transformation of Rice Calli In accordance with embodiments of the invention, Agrobacterium-mediated transformation may be performed as follows: 1. inoculate the calli on the NBD/N6 medium, and incubate in dark at 25-26° C. for 4 days; 2. prepare YEB CM culture medium; 3. streak Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA105 containing the recombinant plasmid pCAMBIA1301-OsGIF1 on YEB medium (containing 50 ul/ml of Kan and 20 ug/ml of Rif), and culture the same at 28° C., 200 rpm for 36 h; 4. culture the bacteria until OD660 reaches 1.0-1.5; 5. transfer the calli into a sterilized triangular flask; 6. pour proper amount of the above cultured Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA105 into the flask and ensure that all the calli are immersed therein; 7. incubate at ambient temperature for 20 min with gentle shaking; 8. remove the bacterium suspension and blot excessive suspension using aseptic filter paper; transfer the calli onto the NBD culture medium (+AS100); 9. co-culture at 20-25° C. for 2-3 days; 10. transfer the co-cultured calli into a sterilized triangularflask, wash the calli with sterilized water containing 500 mg/L carbenicillin for 2-3 time to remove the bacteria; 11. transfer the Galli to the selective medium (containing NBD, 200 mg/L of Timent and 50 mg/L of hygromicin (Hyg)) for screening of transformed cells. Perform two to three screening cycles (3 weeks for each). 12. transfer the pre-differentiated calli to differential medium (containing NB, 2 mg/L of BAP, and 0.5 mg/L of NAA) after 2-3 week, incubate at 26° C. for 16 h with light and 8 h in dark. 13. transfer the resistance regenerated plant to root media (containing 1/2MS and 0.5 mg/L of NAA) after 2-3 weeks for strong seedling and rooting; 14. wash away the agar from the resistance regenerated plant after 3 weeks, transplant it to the greenhouse, and collect the seeds for molecular identification. 4. Quantification of Sugar and Starch Developing grains were harvested, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80° C. until use. Sugar content and starch levels in grains without hulls were determined using the method by Hampp et al. (Hampp, R., Egger, B., Effenberger, S. & Einig, W. Carbon Allocation in Developing Spruce Needles—Enzymes and Intermediates of Sucrose Metabolism. Physiologia Plantarum 90, 299-306 (1994)). Example 1 Population Construction, Gene Cloning and Function Analysis The inventor discovered a rice mutant from the mutant bank induced from Zhonghua 11 (ZH11), wherein the seed filling of the mutant was seriously compromised. Vegetative growth of the mutant crop showed no significance to wild-type ones, while grain filling was significantly compromised with a decrease in the weight of 1,000 grains of 15-30% and a reduction in rice quality. It was then entitled Osgif1 (grain incomplete filling 1), which confirmed that the OsGIF1 gene was an important gene that controlled the crop yield and rice quality through grain filling. The inventor obtained a gene mapping population through the hybridization between the Osgif7 mutant and Zhenshan 97. A scan for the LIF1 locus was performed through Bulked Segregant Analysis (BSA) using the 130 pairs of SSR primers uniformly distributed on the 12 rice chromosomes. The Lif1 locus was primarily mapped to be near the SRD5 region on the long arm of chromosome 4, and was ultimately mapped to a 32-kb fragment between caps-4 and caps-8 comprising three putative genes. The inventor discovered a 1-nt deletion in the Osgif1 mutant (nt 4588 on the DNA sequence of OsGIF1 genome) based on the DNA sequencing of the mutant and wild-type crops. Through fine-mapping of OsGIF1, sequencing and function validation, the inventor obtained the genome sequence of wild-type OsGIF1 (DNA) as shown by SEQ ID NO: 3 (including promoter), the sequence of OsGIF1 coding region (cDNA sequence) as shown by SEQ ID NO: 1, and the protein sequence of OsGIF1 as shown by SEQ ID NO: 2. In the case of the aforementioned mutation (deletion of the No. 4588 nucleotide in the genome sequence of OsGIF1), the mutant did not express OsGIF1 protein. Example 2 Effect of GIF1 Gene on Grain Filling and Yield The inventor compared various phenotypes of rice grains from gif1 mutant with those of OsGIF1 wild-type ZH11 crops. Results were shown in Table 2. TABLE 2 Effect of gif1 mutant on rice grain phenotype gif1/ Signif- ZH11 gif1 ZH11 icance Ear number/crop 11.00 ± 2.30 9.96 ± 2.73 0.90 no Seed number/ear 122.12 ± 33.71 124.82 ± 30.70 1.02 no Seed number/crop 1343.29 ± 372.12 1279.38 ± 239.05 0.95 no Number of incomplete 35.56 ± 10.83 34.33 ± 15.68 0.97 no filling seed/ear Seed weight (g)/ear 2.90 ± 0.73 2.45 ± 0.63 0.84 yes Seed weight (g)/crop 32.14 ± 8.60 25.09 ± 4.44 0.78 yes weight of 1,000 24.00 ± 0.01 19.71 ± 0.01 0.82 yes seeds (g) weight of 1,000 brown 21.33 ± 0.1 16.15 ± 0.15 0.76 yes rice grains (g) As illustrated in the Table, the gif1 mutation interfered with seed filling and reduced crop yield although ear number or seed number was not affected. The results showed in following Example 3 demonstrated that transgenic complementation could effectively eliminate such effects and control rice grain filling, and thus increasing the crop yield. Example 3 Effect of OsGIF1 Gene on Rice Quality The grains of brown rice and polished rice having wild-type OsGIF1 gene were big and full, while those of the mutant rice without the expression of OsGIF1 gene were small and not full. The inventor constructed the recombinant plasmid of pCAMBIA1301-OsGIF1 containing OsGIF1 gene, and transformed the same to the mutant (gif1) calli. The mutant transgetic plant was thus obtained, which could regain the wild-type features. Results were shown in FIG. 1 and FIGS. 7(a-g). The grains of brown rice and polished rice having wild-type OsGIF1 gene were big and full, while those of mutant rice without the expression of OsGIF1 gene were small and not full. Therefore, the mutant (gif1) had reduced rice quality, whereas transgenic complementation could effectively compensate for the reduction in rice quality as induced by the gif1 mutation and thereby improving the crop quality. Besides, the inventor constructed the recombinant plasmid of pCAMBIA1301-OsGIF1 containing OsGIF1 gene, and transformed the same into the calli of wild-type rice (cultivar TP309). Transgenic crop overexpressing OsGIF1 was obtained, and was compared with the wild-type crop. Results showed that the former possessed bigger and heavier grains as shown by FIGS. 8 and 9 (a-c). mRNAs were extracted from transgenic rice of G-2 and G-8 overexpressing OsGIF1, wild-type rice (WT), and empty vector transformed rice (Vector) to separately amplify OsGIF1 through RT-PCR. The amplified products were detected by agarose electrophoresis, and results showed that the transgenic rice overexpressing GIF1 possessed higher expression level of the OsGIF1 gene (FIG. 9d). Example 4 Effect of OsGIF1 Gene on Seed Vigor Plants with wild-type OsGIF1 gene showed strong rooting and rapid leaf growth, while plants with mutant gif1 gene showed significantly weak rooting and slow leaf growth. The inventor constructed the recombinant plasmid of pCAMBIA1301-OsGIF1 containing OsGIF1 gene, and transformed the same to the calli of the mutant (gif1) to produce the mutant transgenic plant. Rooting and leaf of the transgenic plant could regain the wild-type features. As illustrated in FIG. 2, plants with wild-type OsGIF1 gene showed strong rooting and rapid leaf growth, while plants with mutant gif gene showed significantly weak rooting and slow leaf growth. Results demonstrated that the gif1 mutant caused a reduced seed vigor, whereas complementation could effectively eliminate the reduction in seed vigor as induced by the gif1 mutant. Example 5 Effect of OsGIF1 Gene on Seed Ear and Resistance to Storage Diseases The inventor constructed the recombinant plasmid of pCAMBIA1301-OsGIF1 containing the OsGIF1 gene, and transformed the same to the calli of the mutant (gif1) to produce the mutant transgenic plant. Resistance of the transgenic plant to storage diseases was restored to the wild-type level. Results are shown in FIGS. 3 and 4. As shown in FIG. 3, plants with wild-type OsGIF gene possessed full ears, while plants with mutant gif gene possessed notably shriveled ears which were more susceptible to diseases. FIG. 4 showed the typical storage disease bacteria isolated from the seeds of gif1 mutant plant, wherein FIGS. 4A and 4B refer to the isolated Rhizopus sp. and Alternaria sp., respectively. In addition, some other storage disease bacteria were also isolated. Results indicated that gif1 mutant reduced ear quality and crop resistance towards storage diseases, thus shortening the storage time. Comparatively, transgenic complementation could eliminate such interference and improve the crop resistance. Example 6 Tissue Specificity of OsGIF1 Gene The inventor constructed a clone comprising OsGIF1 promoter region operably linked to the GUS reporter gene, and transformed the same into ZH11 rice. Tissue specific expression of the GUS reporter gene and OsGIF1 gene as promoted by the OsGIF1 promoter was evaluated. Detailed construction method was as follows: Promoter of the OsGIF1 gene was obtained by PCR with forward primer (tataagettgateggccatactcc (SEQ ID NO: 4)), reverse primer (taggatccctttgctctcacacttg (SEQ ID NO: 5)), and using the OsGIF1 genome DNA as template. The promoter was cloned into pBI101 (from Clonetech, bearing GUS), which was then digested by EcoR I and Hind III. The fragment obtained was collected and ligated to equally digested pCAMBIA1300 to produce the desired clone containing pCAMBIA1300+promoter+GUS (method for the tissue coloration assay was described in Jeferenson, R A (1987) Plant Mol Biol Rep). As shown in FIGS. 5A-K, specific expression of the OsGIF1 gene was detected in the root, internode, and vascular trace in the dorsiventral region of the seed. In addition, mRNA was extracted from wild-type or mutant crops, and OsGIF1 was separately amplified through RT-PCR. The amplified products were detected by agarose electrophoresis. The results were shown in FIGS. 5L-N. FIG. 5L showed the RT-PCR result of mRNA from gif1 mutant and wild-type crops; FIG. 5M showed the RT-PCR result of mRNA from different rice tissues; FIG. 5N showed the RT-PCR result of mRNA from rice ear on different days after flowering (DAF). Example 7 Effect of OsGIF1 Gene on Sugar Metabolism and Accumulation in Grains The inventor constructed the recombinant plasmid of pCAMBIA1301-OsGIF1 containing OsGIF1 gene, and transformed the same to the calli of the mutant (gif1) to produce the mutant transgenic plants. Sugar metabolism and accumulation of the transgenic plants were monitored and compared with that of the wild-type ZH11 plant. As shown in FIGS. 6 and 7 (h-j), OsGIF1 could successfully regulate sugar metabolism and accumulation in grains, thus regulating grain quality. In addition to the OsGIF1 gene described above, inventors of the present invention also investigated genetic manipulation of GIF1 genes and proteins from Arabidopsis (AtGIF1) and maize (ZmGIF1). As with OsGIF1 gene, these GIF1 genes (AtGIF1 and ZmGIF1) were also able to improve growth rate, grain yield and starch contents in maize. These results suggest that other GIF1 genes and proteins would also have the abilities to improve the graining filling and yields of crops. The following examples will use maize (Zea mays L.), specifically the elite maize (Zea mays L.) inbred line Ye478, to illustrate such uses. From the inbred line (Ye478), different transgenic plants may be produced by the Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation, as noted abovew. For analysis of tissue expression of ZmGIF1, total RNA was extracted from various tissues of B73 maize with RNAiso Plus™ and RNAiso-Mate™ for Plant Tissue (TaKaRa, Dalian, China), and treated with RNase-free DNase (Promega, Shanghai, China). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed with the ReverTra Ace® (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan). Gene Clone and Plasmid Construction The ZmGIF1 gene and 2-kb promoter region were cloned from the B73 maize. The AtGIF1 gene was cloned from Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia-0). Total RNA was isolated with the TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen, Shanghai, China) following the manufacturer's instructions. The coding sequences of the various GIF1 genes, respectively, together with double cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter, the bar gene, which enables the plant to resist the herbicide glufosinate, were cloned into pCAMBIA3301, after appropriate digestion using standard protocols described by Sambrook et al. (Supplementary FIG. 3). The resultant plasmids were then introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105 by the freeze-thaw method. Complementation Test and β-Glucuronidase (GUS) Activity Analyses The ZrnGIF1 gene with its promoter region was inserted into the binary vector pCAMBIA3301 to generate the plasmid pZmPr-ZnGIF1. The plasmid was introduced into the mn1 mutant (i.e., Zmgf1 mutant). To generate ZmGIF1 promoter-GUS construct, the 2-kb promoter region was inserted into the pCAMBIA3381Z vector and introduced into the inbred line Ye478. GUS activities in the transgenic plants were assessed by histochemical assays. Molecular Analyses Genomic DNA was isolated from maize leaves by the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method. PCR assays were performed with specific primers. Total RNA was prepared from maize tissues using TRIZOL® reagent (Invitrogen, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For RT-PCR, 1-5 μg of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis with the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas). Real-time PCR was carried out with primers and SYBR Green Realtime PCR Master Mix (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan). Chlorophyll Fluorescence Measurements, IAA and Sugar Content Determination of Maize Plants in Flowerpots Seeds of T2 homozygous transgenic and wild type (WT) lines (Ye478) were sown in the flowerpots (diameter, 28 cm; height, 28 cm) with homogeneous loam and were grown in a greenhouse at 32/22° C. (day/night) with a photon flux density of 700 μmol/m2/s, a relative humidity of 50-60% and a photoperiod of 14/10 h (light/dark). The plants were thinned to two plants per pot when they reached the 4-leaf stage, and were watered sufficiently every day till the 13-leaf stage. Then, the photosynthesis activities were measured on the 10th fully-expanded leaves using Junior-PAM (Walz, Germany) after a 5 min dark adaptation according to the manufacturer's protocol. For the IAA content determinations, the 13th leaf was frozen with liquid nitrogen, homogenized and then lyophilized. Samples of 2 g dry weight (DW) were purified and finally analyzed at Hunan Normal University (Changsha, China) using the described methods. For the sugar content, the 5th, 8th and 11th leaves were used. The fresh weight (FW) of aerial parts of WT and transgenic lines were measured. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) The kernels from mature mutant, complementary, WT and transgenic maize were harvested and dried. Then, these kernels were cast into blocks, and the sections were cemented onto aluminum specimen support stubs, coated with gold by sputter coating, and examined in a scanning electron microscope (JSM-6360LV; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). Field Trials Field experiments were carried out in the Experimental Field of Jiyuan (Henan Province, April 2011), Nanbin Farm (Hainan Province, October 2011) and Zhangye (Gansu Province, June 2012) using transgenic lines (T3, T4 and T5, respectively) and WT. The trial plots were arranged in a random complete block design with three replications. Forty seeds of each homozygous transgenic and WT line were sown in a double row plot. The plot was 2.5 m length, 1.2 m width and with an interval of 0.25 m between plants. Three replicates were planted. The plants were thinned at the five-leaf stage, resulting in 20 plants in each plot (a population density of approximately 66,700 plants/ha). Growth perfounance was observed during the whole life cycle. Plants at the flowering stage were self-pollinated. Cobs and kernels were collected to take pictures, measure the 100-grain weight and detect sugar concentration on days 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 after pollination. Kernels of 12 DAP were collected for invertase activity assay. After harvest, ears were dried to constant weight, and then the ear length, ear weight, grain rows, grain number, 1000-grain weight, and starch content were measured for ten randomly selected ears for each plot. Statistical Analysis All data are presented as the mean±SE. Data were statistically examined using ANOVA methodology, and differences in value means were compared according to Duncan's multiple comparison tests. All analyses were performed with the SPSS 17.0 for windows. A value of P<0.05 was considered statistically significant difference. Example 8 Expression of ZmGIF1 in Maize (Ye478) RT-PCR analyses demonstrated that ZmGIF1 (ZmCWIN2; also know as Mn1) is ubiquitous expressed in all tested tissues, including root, leaves, stem, and tassels, with the most abundant expression in developing seeds (FIG. 10a). The results shown in FIG. 10a were obtained with cDNA derived from the indicated tissues as templates in PCR with ZmGIF1 gene specific primers. The Actin1 gene was used as an internal control. To elucidate the action site of ZmGIF1, the expression of ZmGIF1 was investigated using a pZmGIF1-β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter transgene (pGIF1-GUS) (FIG. 11a). GUS activity was mainly detected in growing root and shoot tip (FIG. 10b,c), with a strong expression in the basal endosperm transfer layer in the kernel (at 21 DAP (days after pollination)) during early grain-filling (FIG. 10d). This observation is consistent with increased ZmGIF1 transcript accumulations in the filling grains post 10 DAP (FIG. 10a). To confirm the invertase activity, ZmGIF1 was expressed under its native promoter in mn1 mutant (FIG. 11b). As shown in FIG. 12, transformation of ZmGIF1 restored the mn1 seed phenotype to the wild type). These results show that the phenotypic changes manifested by the mn1 mutant indeed result from disruption of the ZmGIF1 gene. To investigate the utility of the GIF1 proteins, three constructs containing AtGIF1, OsGIF1 or ZmGIF1 were constructed and introduced into the genome of Ye478, respectively (FIG. 11c). Fifteen AtGIF1, seven OsGIF1 and eleven ZmGIF1 transgenic plants, and six homozygous lines of each construct (gene) from these trangenic plants were identified in the T3 generation. Twelve of these homozygous lines, four lines with different expression levels of each gene, were chosen for further experiments. Homozygous T3 plants were grown in the greenhouse for PCR and RT-PCR confirmation. High levels of GIF1 transcript were detected in all tested transgenic plants. In contrast, no AtGIF1 or OsGIF1 transcript was detected in the wild type plants (FIGS. 13-15). To assess whether the enhanced expression of invertase would affect the normal growth and development of transgenic plants, PCR and RT-PCR confirmed homozygous T3 plants were grown in the greenhouse. We observed that transgenic plants grew faster and produced larger ears, as compared to the wild type plants. The seeds were larger and heavier as well (data not shown). To assure these phenotype changes, homozygous T3 plants were grown in Jiyuan (Henan Province, China) for field trial (transgenic trial penult number: 2011-T032). These transgenic plants produced greater biomass (FIG. 16), bigger grain cobs (FIG. 17), and seeds (FIG. 13-15), resulting in improved grain yield per plant (Table 3).

Forty seeds from homozygous T3 transgenic and WT lines were sown in a double-row plot. The plot was 2.5 m in length, with a width of 1.2 m and an interval of 0.25 m between plants. The plants were thinned at the five-leaf stage, resulting in 20 plants in each plot (a population density of approximately 66,700 plants/ha). Four independently selected transgenic lines were used. Seeds were harvested in October for starch content analyses. Values shown are means±s.e.m. Values labeled with different letters are significantly different by Duncan's multiple comparison tests at P<0.05 (n=3). To test whether expression of introduced genes increased invertase activity in the transgenic plants, homozygous T4 plants were simultaneously grown in greenhouse and Nanbin farm (Sanya, Hainan province, China). Cell wall invertase activity in leaves and developing seeds of wild type and transgenic plants was examined. Under both growth conditions, transgenic plants grew faster and bigger than the nontransgenic wild type plants (FIG. 18-20). The cell wall invertase activity of leaves (FIG. 21a-c) and developing grains at 12 DAP (FIG. 21d-f) of transgenic lines was significantly higher than that of the wild type plants. This was consistent with the higher glucose and fructose content (FIG. 22b,c; 23), and with the faster shoot growth (FIG. 18) and grain filling (FIG. 22d) of transgenic grains compared to the wild type grains at the early filling stage. The extents of all the phenotype changes were correlated with the expression levels of introduced genes in the transgenic lines: lines showing higher expression levels of transgenes exhibited higher levels of cell wall invertase activity, and consequently produced greater shoot biomass and larger ears with bigger seed size and numbers than did those transgenic lines showing relatively lower expression levels of transgene (FIGS. 13-21). The growths of T5 cobs of the wild-type and different transgenic lines (T4) were found to differ starting at 7 DAP. Transgenic cobs grew faster and bigger than the wild type controls (FIG. 24-25). Consistently, the transgenic cobs (T6) was bigger (FIGS. 26-28), and the grain yield of transgenic lines was higher than the nontransgenic controls. The enhanced grain yield resulted from both increased seed numbers and seed sizes (weights) per ear (Table 3). The grain yield and yield increase were affected by the weather and location where the plants were grown. The final grain yield in Jiyuan (2011) was lower than that in Zhangye (2012) where the sunlight is stronger (Table 3). However, transgenic lines grown in both locations consistently showed a higher grain yield per plant relative to wild type plants. The grain yield increased 145.3% for AtGIF1-3, 141.2% for OsGIF1-4, 127.0% for ZmGIF1-3 in 2011, and 53.6% for AtGIF1-3, 65.8% for OsGIF1-4, 109.2% for ZmGIF1-1 in 2012. It has been well documented that invertase-mediated sucrose cleavage directly or indirectly regulates the levels of key plant hormones during seed development. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is the predominant hormone in kernels of maize. Although no significant phenotype changes is caused in the vegetative growth, the deficiency of Mn1 locus in mn1 leads to pleiotropic changes including altered sugar levels and decreased IAA accumulation throughout seed development (FIG. 12a-e). Molecular study revealed that the decreased levels of IAA in mn1 seeds are mainly due to the reduced expression of the endosperm-specific ZmTar1 gene of the IPA branch. We hypothesized that constitutive expression of the introduced invertase gene would increase IAA accumulations in transgenic plants, which subsequently promoted the shoot growth. Indeed, except those lines expressing AtGIF1, all the transgenic lines expressing OsGIF1 or ZmGIF1 accumulated more IAA in the leaves than did the notransgenic controls (FIG. 29a). This is also consistent with the higher transcriptional level of ZmTar1 in the leaves of these transgenic plants (FIG. 29b). The normal vegetative growth and the unchanged ZmTar1 expression in the leaves of mn1 mutant further supported this hypothesis (FIG. 30a). We compared the photosynthesis between wild type and transgenic plants grown in the greenhouse. Both maximal efficiency of PSII photochemistry (Fv/Fm) and photosynthetic electron transport rate (ETR) in transgenic plants were higher (FIG. 31). All these results suggested that photosynthesis was also improved in transgenic plants and such an improvement was associated with an improvement in the actual PSII efficiency. In addition, we examined the starch content and composition of seeds from wild type and transgenic plants. When checked with scanning electron microscope, no significant difference was seen between wild type and mn1 seed starch (FIG. 30b-d). However, larger starch granules were observed in the seeds of transgenic plants (FIG. 32). Detailed examination demonstrated that the total starch content, the ratios of amylopectin to amylase, and the percentages of large starch granules (>20 μm in diameter) significantly increased in the seeds of all transgenic lines which showed high expression levels of introduced invertase genes (Tables 3-6). The total starch content increased 6.2% in AtGIF1-3, 13% in OsGIF1-4, and 19.4% in ZmGIF1-1 (Tables 3).

Values labeled with different letters are significantly different by LSD multiple comparison tests at P<0.05 (n=3). The above results clearly show that GIF1 genes and their homologs would be useful in applications to regulate grain filling and crop yields. Various related sequences having high homologies and/or conserved sequences should also have these activities. FIG. 33 shows Sequence alignments of GIF1 with homologous proteins from different plants. The BLAST search program (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) was used to look for invertase sequences homologous to GIF1. The highest homologous invertase sequences were aligned using a GENEDOC software. The aligned invertases include the functionally known OsGIF1 (rice ADE60571.1), OsCIN1 (rice ADE60654.1), PtINCW1 (PaxgINV1 ABY81288.1), PtINCW2 (PaxgINV2 ABY81289.1) and ZmCWIN1 (maize AAD02511.1), ZmGIF1 (also known as Mn1; NM—001112126), and functionally unknown invertases ATCWINV2 (Arabidopsis NP—190828.2) and AtGIF1 (Arabidopsis NP—566464.1). The β-fructosidase motif, the Cys catalysis site, and the conserved glycosylation motif are indicated. That these sequences have these conserved domains suggests that variants of the above described sequences would have the same functions if they also include these conserved domains.
