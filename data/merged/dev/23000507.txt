Experimental tooth movement-induced osteoclast activation is regulated by sympathetic signaling.
Experimental tooth movement (ETM) changes the distribution of sensory nerve fibers in periodontal ligament and the bone architecture through the stimulation of bone remodeling.
As the sympathetic nervous system is involved in bone remodeling, we examined whether ETM is controlled by sympathetic signaling or not.
In male mice, elastic rubber was inserted between upper left first molar (M1) and second molar (M2) for 3 or 5 days.
Nerve fibers immunoreactive for not only sensory neuromarkers, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), but also sympathetic neuromarkers, such as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) were increased in the periodontal ligament during ETM.
To elucidate the effect of the sympathetic signal mediated by ETM, mice were intraperitoneally injected with a β-antagonist, propranolol (PRO: 20 μg/g/day), or a β-agonist, isoproterenol (ISO: 5 μg/g/day) from 7 days before ETM.
PRO treatment suppressed the amount of tooth movement by 12.9% in 3-day ETM and by 32.2% in 5-day ETM compared with vehicle treatment.
On the other hand, ISO treatment increased it.
Furthermore, ETM remarkably increased the osteoclast number on the bone surface (alveolar socket) (Oc.N/BS) in all drug treatments.
PRO treatment suppressed Oc.
N/BS by 39.4% in 3-day ETM, while ISO treatment increased it by 32.1% in 3-day ETM compared with vehicle treatment.
Chemical sympathectomy using 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA: 250 μg/g) showed results similar to those for PRO treatment in terms of both the amount of tooth movement and osteoclast parameters.
Our data showed that blockade of sympathetic signaling inhibited the tooth movement and osteoclast increase induced by ETM, and stimulation of sympathetic signaling accelerated these responses.
These data suggest that the mechano-adaptive response induced by ETM is controlled by sympathetic signaling through osteoclast activation.
