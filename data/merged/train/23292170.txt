Marked decline in beta cell function during pregnancy leads to the development of glucose intolerance in Japanese women.
The aim of this study is to investigate glucose metabolism longitudinally during pregnancy to explore mechanisms underlying gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
We reviewed a total of 62 pregnant Japanese women who underwent a 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) twice during pregnancy (median: early, 13; late, 28 weeks' gestation) because of positive GDM screening.
All showed normal OGTT results in early pregnancy.
Based on late OGTT, 15 had GDM (late-onset GDM) and 47 normal glucose tolerance (NGT).
In early pregnancy, there were no significant differences in insulin sensitivity (insulin sensitivity index derived from OGTT [ISOGTT] and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance [HOMA-IR]) and insulin secretion (a ratio of the total area-under-the-insulin-curve to the total area-under-the-glucose-curve [AUCins/glu] and insulinogenic index [IGI]) between the NGT and late-onset GDM groups.
In each group, insulin sensitivity significantly decreased from early to late pregnancy, most in the late-onset GDM group (each p < 0.05).
The insulin secretion showed no significant changes with advancing pregnancy in both of the groups, although late-onset GDM showed significantly lower IGI compared with NGT in late OGTT (p < 0.05).
When assessed beta cell function by OGTT-derived disposition index (i.e. Insulin Secretion-Sensitivity Index-2 and IGI/fasting insulin), the indices significantly decreased from early to late pregnancy in the both groups (each p < 0.05).
Women with late-onset GDM showed significantly lower indices compared with NGT (each p < 0.05).
The failure of beta cell to compensate for decreased insulin sensitivity could contribute to the development of the late-onset GDM.
