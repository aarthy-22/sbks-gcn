Effects of 17α-ethynylestradiol-induced cholestasis on the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin in rats: reduced biliary excretion and hepatic metabolism of doxorubicin.
Abstract 1.
Since the prevalent hormonal combination therapy with estrogen analogues in cancer patients has frequency and possibility to induce the cholestasis, the frequent combination therapy with 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE, an oral contraceptive) and doxorubicin (an anticancer drug) might be monitored in aspect of efficacy and safety.
Doxorubicin is mainly excreted into the bile via P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2) in hepatobiliary route and metabolized via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A subfamily.
Also the hepatic Mrp2 (not P-gp) and CYP3A subfamily levels were reduced in EE-induced cholestatic (EEC) rats.
Thus, we herein report the pharmacokinetic changes of doxorubicin with respect to the changes in its biliary excretion and hepatic metabolism in EEC rats.
2.
The pharmacokinetic study of doxorubicin after intravenous administration of its hydrochloride was conducted along with the investigation of bile flow rate and hepatobiliary excretion of doxorubicin in control and EEC rats.
3.
The significantly greater AUC (58.7% increase) of doxorubicin in EEC rats was due to the slower CL (32.9% decrease).
The slower CL was due to the reduction of hepatic biliary excretion (67.0% decrease) and hepatic CYP3A subfamily-mediated metabolism (21.9% decrease) of doxorubicin.
These results might have broader implications to understand the altered pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacologic effects of doxorubicin via biliary excretion and hepatic metabolism in experimental and clinical estrogen-induced cholestasis.
