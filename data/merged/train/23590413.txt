Canagliflozin , an inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
INTRODUCTION: Canagliflozin is an orally administered sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor proposed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
Canagliflozin improves glycemic control in an insulin-independent fashion through inhibition of glucose reuptake in the kidney.
AREAS COVERED: This article reviews the available data on the pharmacodynamics, the pharmacokinetics and metabolism, and the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin.
Relevant articles were identified via PubMed using the search term canagliflozin with no date restriction.
The authors also discuss the abstracts from canagliflozin studies presented at large diabetes conferences.
EXPERT OPINION: Canagliflozin offers a relatively modest reduction in HbA1c, FPG, and PPG.
It has a low incidence of hypoglycemia and a reduction in body weight.
Dose adjustment may be recommended in the elderly, those on loop diuretics, and those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) if there are concerns or symptoms of volume-related side effects.
Issues remain with observed increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and the odds of heart attack and stroke.
Canagliflozin offers a novel mechanism of action, a modest glycemic control, and a favorable side-effect profile.
It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in April 2013 and is undergoing evaluation by the European Medicines Agency.
