Technical Field The present invention relates to techniques used in the fermentation industry, more specifically, a method for producing an L-amino acid or nucleic acid by fermentation using a microorganism, in which culture is performed with precipitating the L-amino acid or nucleic acid. Background Art L-Amino acids are industrially produced by fermentation using amino acid-producing bacteria belonging to the coryneform bacteria or the family Enterobacteriaceae and having an L-amino acid-producing ability. As these amino acid-producing bacteria, strains isolated from the nature as well as artificial mutants of such strains and recombinant strains in which L-amino acid biosynthesis enzyme is enhanced by genetic recombination are used in order to improve the productivity. Examples of such bacteria include, for example, for L-tryptophan fermentation, a bacterium of which anthranilate synthetase activity, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase activity and tryptophan synthase activity are enhanced (Patent document 1), and bacteria of which tryptophan operon is amplified (Patent documents 2 to 4). Examples of the techniques for L-glutamic acid fermentation include a technique of increasing L-glutamic acid-producing ability by enhancing the glutamate dehydrogenase gene (gdh), isocitrate dehydrogenase gene (icdA), aconitate hydratase gene (acnA, acnB) and citrate synthase gene (gltA) (Patent document 5). Examples of bacteria for L-threonine fermentation include a microorganism of which aspartokinase III gene (lysC) and aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase gene (asd) as well as the aspartokinase I gene (thrA), homoserine kinase gene (thrB) and threonine synthase gene (thrC) encoded by the thr operon are enhanced (Patent document 6), and so forth. Although L-amino acid-producing abilities are considerably increased by the aforementioned breeding of microorganisms and improvement of production methods, it is still desired to develop more inexpensive and efficient methods for producing L-amino acids in order to respond to increase of demand in future. Methods of performing fermentation while precipitating L-amino acid accumulating in a culture medium are also known (Patent documents 7 and 8). As for L-glutamic acid, a method for producing L-glutamic acid by using a microorganism which can accumulate L-glutamic acid with its precipitation has been disclosed (Patent document 9). Moreover, a fermentation method utilizing crystallization in which crystals of amino acid having a mean particle diameter of 1 to 120 µm are added to medium is also known (Patent document 10). However, productivities of the aforementioned methods are insufficient as compared to those obtainable in usual fermentation methods in which crystals are not precipitated, and further improvements have been desired.

Examples of the nucleic acid include purine nucleosides, purine nucleotides, and so forth. The purine nucleosides include inosine, xanthosine, guanosine, adenosine, and so forth, and the purine nucleotides include 5'-phosphate esters of the purine nucleosides, for example, inosinic acid, (inosine-5'-phosphate, henceforth also referred to as "IMP"), xanthylic acid (xanthosine-5'-phosphate, henceforth also referred to as "XMP"), guanylic acid (guanosine-5'-monophosphate, henceforth also referred to as "GMP"), adenylic acid (adenosine-5'-monophosphate, henceforth also referred to as "AMP"), and so forth. The nucleic acid referred to in the present invention includes nucleic acid derivatives Ara-U (uracil arabinoside), ZVA (Z-valacyclovir). In the present invention, the aforementioned L-amino acids, nucleic acids and derivatives thereof may also be referred to as "target substance". The stirring impeller is a device for stirring a liquid medium contained in a fermentation tank, and shape thereof is not particularly limited. The stirring impeller usually consists of an axis and fins (blades) fixed on the axis, or the fins or a part thereof may constitute the axis. The stirring impeller usually rotates around the axis as the center, but it may operate in other ways. As shape of the fins, those in the form of turbine, paddle, propeller, anchor, ribbon, or the like may be used, but it is not limited to these. Moreover, the number of fins and disposition of each fin are not also particularly limited. The stirring impeller operates upon receiving power with the axis from a power machinery such as motors. About the stirring impeller, for example, Chemical Engineering Manual (Kagaku Kogaku Binran, edited by Chemical Engineering Association, revised 4th edition, pp.1310-1311, Maruzen Co., Ltd.) can be referred to. In the present invention, power density of the stirring impeller means power of the stirring impeller per unit volume of fermentation broth. Power of the stirring impeller is calculated by subtracting power (output) of a power machine at the time of performing stirring in an empty fermentation tank from power (output) of the power machine at the time of stirring the fermentation broth. Specifically, the power can be calculated from, for example, when the power machine is a motor, current which flows in the motor and efficiency of the motor. The power can also be measured by preparing a calibration curve showing the relation of the current which flows in a motor and the power, and converting the current into the power using the calibration curve. Furthermore, the power can also be calculated in accordance with the following equation from a value of torque applied on the stirring impeller, which is measured by using an instrument for measuring torque such as torque meter or torque sensor. Power PkW=T x2x π x n/1000T: Torque [N·m]n: Rotation number of stirring impeller [/s] A value obtained by dividing the value of power measured as described above with the volume of the medium is the power density of the stirring impeller. In the present invention, the power density of the stirring impeller is preferably controlled to 0.5 kW/m3 to 2.4 kW/m3 during fermentation after precipitation of crystals or addition of seed crystals. The power density of the stirring impeller is controlled to be more preferably 2.0 kW/m3 or lower, particularly preferably 1.5 kW/m3 or lower, most preferably 1.0 kW/m3 or lower. The lower limit of the power density of the stirring impeller is controlled to be 0.5 kW/m3 or higher, more preferably 0.6 kW/m3 or higher, most preferably 0.7 kW/m3 or higher. The power density of the stirring impeller is controlled to be within the aforementioned range after precipitation of crystals or addition of seed crystals, and it is preferably continuously controlled as described above until completion of the fermentation. Moreover, if the power density of the stirring impeller is substantially controlled to be within the mentioned range, it may temporarily exceed the aforementioned range. Specifically, if the power density of the stirring impeller is within the aforementioned range for 50% or more, preferably 70% or more, more preferably 90% or more, of the period after precipitation of crystals or addition of seed crystals until fermentation or accumulation of target substance reaches a plateau, the power density of the stirring impeller is substantially controlled. The power density of the stirring impeller before precipitation of crystals or addition of seed crystals is preferably higher than the aforementioned range defined for the period after precipitation of crystals or after addition of seed crystals, and it is preferably controlled to be 2.6 kW/m3 or higher, more preferably 2.8 kW/m3 or higher, particularly preferably 3.0 kW/m3 or higher. If the power density of the stirring impeller is substantially controlled to be within the mentioned range, it may be temporarily lower than the aforementioned range. Specifically, if the power density of the stirring impeller is within the aforementioned range for 50% or more, preferably 70% or more, more preferably 90% or more, of the period from the start of the fermentation or the target substance production period described later to precipitation of crystals or addition of seed crystals, the power density of the stirring impeller is substantially controlled. In the present invention, if the amount of accumulated target substance exceeds the saturation solubility thereof, or exceeds supersaturation state, crystals of the target substance spontaneously precipitate. Therefore, if the microorganism has an ability to accumulate the target substance in the medium in an amount providing a concentration exceeding the saturation solubility, any operation for precipitating the target substance is not necessary. However, in order to promote precipitation of the target substance, crystals may be added. The seed crystals means crystals added to the medium as required for such a purpose. Although the seed crystals are not limited to those of the target substance so long as they are effective for promoting precipitation of the crystals, they are desirably crystals of the target substance. For example, in the case of L-tryptophan fermentation, crystals of L-tryptophan are desirable. As for concentration of the seed crystals to be added, when the microorganism which produces the target substance has an ability to precipitate crystals in the medium in the fermentation process, the seed crystals are desirably added in an amount of 0.5 g/L or more, preferably 1 g/L or more, more preferably 5 g/L or more, still more preferably 10 g/L or more. When the microorganism has not any ability to accumulate the target substance in the medium in an amount providing a concentration exceeding the saturation solubility, it is necessary to add the target substance to the medium in such an amount that concentration of the target substance exceeds the saturation solubility. Although the target substance to be added in such a case may be in the form of solution, or fine particles or crystals, it preferably contains crystals at least as seed crystals. In this case, the amount of the seed crystals is desirably 10 g/L or more, preferably 20 g/L or more, more preferably 30 g/L or more, still more preferably 50 g/L or more. In the present invention, any substance added in order to promote precipitation of the target substance is, whether it is a solution or powder, included in the scope of the seed crystal, unless specified. In any case, as for the upper limit of the concentration of the seed crystals to be added, concentration is not particularly defined, so long as substance production and growth of the microorganism is not markedly decreased. However, it is preferably 100 g/L or lower, more preferably 90 g/L or lower, still more preferably 80 g/L or lower, particularly preferably 70 g/L or lower. Although the seed crystals may be added any time during the period before the microorganism having an ability to produce the target substance is inoculated to the medium, or culture period after the microorganism is inoculated to the medium, they are preferably added, for example, after the microorganism is inoculated to the medium, and around when the concentration of the target substance in the medium reaches the saturation solubility and before crystals of the target substance precipitate in the medium, more preferably when the concentration of the target substance is at a level providing supersaturation, and before crystals of the target substance precipitate in the medium. If such a timing is represented by the culture time, they are preferably added around 5 hours, desirably around 10 hours, more desirably around 15 hours, still more desirably around 20 hours, most desirably around 25 hours, after the start of the culture or the start of the target substance production stage described later. Furthermore, the seed crystals are preferably added when about 0.2, preferably about 0.3, still more preferably about 0.4, of the total culture time for target substance production or time from the target substance production stage to completion of the culture, which is taken as 1, passes. The saturation solubility referred to here means a concentration of the target substance dissolved in the liquid medium which is saturated with the target substance. That is, it means a steady concentration of the target substance obtained when the supersaturation of the target substance is cancelled. The solubilities of L-amino acids and nucleic acids are as shown in Tables 1 and 2, and the seed crystals are preferably added around when the concentration reaches any of these concentrations.

In the present invention, the power of the stirring impeller before the precipitation of crystals or addition of seed crystals is preferably higher than that after the precipitation of crystals or addition of seed crystals. Although the power of the stirring impeller before the precipitation of crystals or addition of seed crystals may be any power so long as it is within a range preferred for the growth of the microorganism, it is desirably controlled to be 2.4 kW/m3 or higher, preferably 2.6 kW/m3 or higher, more preferably 2.8 kW/m3 or higher, still more preferably 3.0 kW/m3 or higher, most preferably 3.2 kW/m3 or higher. The method of the present invention may include a stage for proliferating a microorganism having an ability to produce a target substance (proliferation phase) and a stage for producing the target substance (target substance production phase). In such a case, it is preferable to allow the microorganism to sufficiently grow in the proliferation stage, and to make it maximally accumulate the target substance in the target substance production phase. Moreover, precipitation of the target substance or addition of seed crystals is preferably attained in the final stage of the growth phase or the target substance - production phase. The total seed crystals to be added may be added at once, divided portions of the total seed crystals may be added two or more times, or they may be added continuously. The "proliferation phase" referred to in the present invention means the stage when the carbon source is primarily used for cell growth, that is, the stage when the microorganism is logarithmically proliferating. The "target substance production phase" referred to in the present invention means the stage when the carbon source is mainly used for target substance production after a period of 10 hours, preferably 15 hours, more preferably 20 hours, from the start of the culture. Power of the stirring impellers in the proliferation phase is not particularly limited, so long as it is within a range suitable for growth of the microorganism, and specifically, it is the same as the power of the stirring impellers used before the precipitation of crystals or addition of seed crystals described above. Any medium may be used for the present invention so long as it contains a carbon source and a nitrogen source as nutrients. As a culture method for the present invention, any of batch culture, fed-batch culture, or continuous culture may be used. In the present invention, the fed-batch culture refers to a culture method in which the medium is continuously or intermittently fed into the culture vessel, and the medium is not extracted until the end of the culture. The continuous culture means a method in which the medium is continuously or intermittently fed into the culture vessel during the culture, and the medium is extracted from the vessel (usually in a volume equivalent to the volume of the fed medium) at the same time. The "starting medium" means the medium used in the batch culture before feeding the feed medium in the fed-batch culture or continuous culture, and the "feed medium" means a medium to be supplied to a fermenter when fed-batch culture or continuous culture is performed. The feed medium may contain all or a part of the components necessary for the growth of a microorganism. The term "fermentation medium" means a medium contained in a fermenter, and a target substance is collected from this fermentation medium. Furthermore, the term "fermenter" means a vessel in which the target substance production is performed, and the shape of this vessel is not limited. For example, a fermentation tank or a jar fermenter may be used. Furthermore, the volume of the fermenter is not limited so long as a target substance can be produced and collected. As the carbon source in the medium which is used for the present invention, saccharides such as glucose, glycerol, fructose, sucrose, maltose, mannose, galactose, starch hydrolysate, and molasses can be used, and glucose and sucrose are particularly preferred. In addition, organic acids such as acetic acid and citric acid and alcohols such as ethanol and methanol can also be used independently or in combination with another carbon source. Furthermore, as a raw material of the carbon source, cane molasses, beet molasses, high test molasses, citrus molasses and invert sugar may be used, and hydrolysates of natural raw materials such as cellulose, starch, corn, cereal, and tapioca may also be used. Furthermore, carbon dioxide dissolved in the culture medium can also be used as the carbon source. These carbon sources can be used in the starting medium and feed medium. The medium may contain one or two or more kinds of these carbon sources. Furthermore, the same carbon source may be used for the starting medium and the feed medium, or the carbon source of the feed medium may be different from that of the starting medium. For example, glucose may be used as the carbon source of the starting medium, while sucrose may be used as the carbon source of the feed medium. As the nitrogen source in the medium of the present invention, ammonia, ammonium salts such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium carbonate, ammonium chloride, ammonium phosphate and ammonium acetate, urea, nitrates, and so forth can be used. Ammonia gas and aqueous ammonia used to adjust the pH can also be utilized as the nitrogen source. Furthermore, peptone, yeast extract, meat extract, malt extract, corn steep liquor, soybean hydrolysate, and so forth can also be utilized. The medium may contain one or more kinds of these nitrogen sources. These nitrogen sources can also be used for both the starting medium and the feed medium. Furthermore, the same nitrogen source can be used for both the starting medium and the feed medium, or the nitrogen source of the feed medium may be different from that of the starting medium. The medium may contain a phosphoric acid source in addition to the carbon source and the nitrogen source. As the phosphoric acid source, potassium dihydrogenphosphate, dipotassium hydrogenphosphate, phosphate polymers such as pyrophosphoric acid, and so forth can be utilized. Furthermore, the medium of the present invention may contain a growth promoting factor (a nutrient with a growth promoting effect), in addition to the carbon source and nitrogen source. As the growth promoting factor, trace metals, amino acids, vitamins, fatty acids, nucleic acids as well as peptone, casamino acid, yeast extract, soybean protein degradation product, and so forth containing the foregoing substances can be used. Aromatic amino acids and branched chain amino acids, in particular, share a common biosynthesis system, and therefore a biosynthesis system of the microorganism for an amino acid other than the target amino acid may be attenuated as described later. In such a case, it is preferable to add the amino acid for which biosynthesis system is attenuated to the medium. For example, when the target amino acid is L-tryptophan, it is desirable to add L-phenylalanine and/or tyrosine, and when the target amino acid is L-phenylalanine, it is desirable to add L-tryptophan and/or L-tyrosine (WO2003/048374). Examples of the trace metals include iron, manganese, magnesium, calcium, and so forth. Examples of the vitamins include vitamin B1, vitamin B2, vitamin B6, nicotinic acid, nicotinic acid amide, vitamin B12, pyridoxine, pantothenic acid, and so forth. These growth promoting factors may be present in the starting medium or the feed medium. Furthermore, when an auxotrophic mutant that requires an amino acid or the like for growth is used, it is preferable to supplement the required nutrient to the medium. In particular, since an L-amino acid biosynthetic pathway is enhanced and an L-amino acid degrading ability is often attenuated in an L-amino acid-producing bacteria which can be used for the present invention as described later, one or more of L-lysine, L-homoserine, L-isoleucine, and L-methionine are preferably added. It is also preferable for nucleic acid-producing bacteria to similarly add a required substance to the medium. The starting medium and the feed medium may have the same or different compositions. Furthermore, when the feed medium is fed at multiple stages, the compositions of the feed media fed at the various stages may be the same or different. The culture is preferably performed as aeration culture at a fermentation temperature of 20 to 45°C, particularly preferably at 30 to 42°C. As for the gas supplied to the fermentation tank, it is also possible to supply high concentration oxygen simultaneously with air, and thereby elevate the oxygen concentration in the supply gas, as well as air (refer to Japanese Patent Publication (KOKOKU) Nos. 05-048117 and 5-39594). The oxygen supply amount may be such an amount that the oxygen concentration in the medium is 2 to 4 ppm, and it is preferable to supply a mixed gas of high concentration oxygen of 40 to 100% oxygen concentration and air at 1/10 to 1.5/1 vvm. The high concentration oxygen can be prepared by using an oxygen concentrator. As the oxygen concentrator, there are those of PSA type and oxygen enrichment membrane type, and a method of evaporating liquid oxygen with an evaporator and supplying it to a fermentation tank, or directly supplying liquid oxygen to a fermentation tank can be used. The aeration culture is performed with the pH adjusted to 5 to 9. If pH is lowered during the culture, for example, calcium carbonate or an alkali such as ammonia gas and aqueous ammonia is added to neutralize the culture. When the target amino acid is an acidic amino acid, for example, L-glutamic acid, it is desirable to perform the culture at pH 3 to 9, preferably pH 3 to 5. When the culture is performed under such conditions preferably for about 10 to 120 hours, a marked amount of target substance is accumulated in the culture medium. Although the concentration of target substance which accumulates is not limited so long as it is higher than that observed with wild-type strains and the target substance can be collected from the medium, it may be 50 g/L or higher, desirably 75 g/L or higher, more desirably 100 g/L or higher when the target substance is an L-amino acid, and it may be 50 g/L or higher, desirably 75 g/L or higher, more desirably 100 g/L or higher, when the target substance is a nucleic acid. The target substance can be collected according to a known collection method from the culture medium after the culture. For example, the target substance precipitated in the medium can be collected by centrifugation or filtration. Moreover, the target substance which is dissolved in the medium may be crystallized, and then the precipitated target substance and the crystals may be isolated together. In the present invention, the culture of the microorganism may be performed as seed culture and main culture in order to ensure accumulation of more target substance than a certain level. For example, the seed culture may be performed as shaking culture using a flask or the like, or batch culture, and the main culture may be performed as fed-batch culture or continuous culture. Alternatively, both the seed culture and the main culture may be performed as batch culture. Furthermore, prior to the seed culture and the main culture, pre-culture may be performed once or twice or more times to successively make the culture scale larger. In these culture methods, when the target substance concentration reaches the intended level, a part of the target substance may be extracted, and fresh medium may be added to repeat the culture. As the fresh medium to be added, a medium containing a carbon source and a nutrient having a growth promoting effect (growth promoting factor) is preferred. As the carbon source, glucose, sucrose, and fructose are preferred. As the growth promoting factor, nitrogen sources, phosphoric acid, amino acids, and so forth are preferred. As the nitrogen source, ammonia, ammonium salts such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium carbonate, ammonium chloride, ammonium phosphate and ammonium acetate, urea, nitrates, and so forth can be used. Furthermore, as the phosphoric acid source, potassium dihydrogenphosphate and dipotassium hydrogenphosphate can be used. As for the amino acids, when an auxotrophic mutant strain is used, it is preferable to supplement the required nutrient. When fed-batch culture or continuous culture is performed in the present invention, the feed medium may be intermittently fed so that the supply of saccharide or nutrition source is temporarily stopped. The supply of the feed medium is stopped, for example, at maximum, 30% or less, preferably 20% or less, particularly preferably 10% or less, of the feeding time. When the feed medium is intermittently fed, the feed medium may be added over a predetermined time, and the second and following additions may be controlled to begin when a rise in the pH or dissolved oxygen concentration is detected by a computer upon depletion of the carbon source in the fermentation medium during the addition-stopped period prior to a certain medium-addition period, so that the substrate concentration in the culture tank be always automatically maintained at a low level (U.S. Patent No. 5,912,113). As the carbon source, glucose, sucrose, and fructose are preferred. As the growth promoting factor, nitrogen sources, phosphoric acid, amino acids, and so forth are preferred. As the nitrogen source, ammonia, ammonium salts such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium carbonate, ammonium chloride, ammonium phosphate and ammonium acetate, urea, nitrates, and so forth can be used. Furthermore, as the phosphoric acid source, potassium dihydrogenphosphate and dipotassium hydrogenphosphate can be used. As for the amino acids, when an auxotrophic mutant strain is used, it is preferable to supplement the required nutrient. Furthermore, the feed medium may be one type of medium, or a mixture of two or more types of media. When two or more types of feed media are used, the media may be mixed and fed by using one feed can, or the media may be separately fed by using two or more feed cans. When fed-batch culture is performed, the feed medium is preferably fed in such an amount that the saccharide amount in the feed medium or the whole fermentation medium does not exceed 30 g/L, and it is preferably controlled to be 20 g/L or lower, more preferably 10 g/L or lower. In particular, the saccharide concentration is preferably controlled so that it is in the aforementioned concentration range at the end of the logarithmic proliferation of the microorganism and thereafter. The feed rate of the carbon source can be controlled by using the method described in U.S. Patent No. 5,912,113. Furthermore, saccharide and phosphoric acid are preferably fed at such concentrations so that saccharide and phosphoric acid serve as limiting factors of the bacterial cell growth. Phosphoric acid can be present in the feed medium in an amount of 2 or lower, preferably 1.5 or lower, more preferably 1 or lower, expressed in terms of the phosphorous/carbon (P/C) ratio (refer to U.S. Patent No. 5,763,230). When the continuous culture method is used in the present invention, the medium may be extracted and fed simultaneously, or a part of the medium may be extracted, and then the medium may be fed. Furthermore, the method may also be a continuous culture method including recycling cells in which the culture medium containing a target substance and bacterial cells is extracted, and only the cells are returned to the fermenter (French Patent No. 2669935). As the method for continuously or intermittently feeding a nutrient source, the same method as used in the fed-batch culture is used. When the culture medium is intermittently extracted, a part of the target substance is extracted when the target substance concentration reaches a predetermined level, and a fresh medium is fed to continue the culture. Furthermore, the culture is preferably performed so that the final volume of the medium after adding the medium is equal to the volume of the culture medium before the extraction. The term "equal" means that the volume corresponding to about 93 to 107% of the volume of the medium before the extraction. When the culture medium is continuously extracted, the extraction is desirably started at the same time as or after the feeding of the nutrient medium. For example, within 5 hours at maximum, desirably 3 hours, more desirably 1 hour, after the start of the feeding, the extraction can be started. Furthermore, the extraction volume of the culture medium is preferably equal to the volume of the fed medium. The continuous culture method of recycling bacterial cells includes intermittently or continuously extracting the fermentation medium when the target substance concentration reaches a predetermined level, extracting only the target substance, and re-circulating filtration residues containing bacterial cells into the fermentation vessel, and it can be performed by referring to, for example, French Patent No. 2669935. Furthermore, the crystals precipitated by the crystallization method of the present invention may be extracted from the fermentation tank during the culture. Specifically, there may be used a method of increasing productivity by performing fermentation in a fermentation tank according to the method of the present invention, extracting the fermentation broth containing the target substance and cells from the fermentation broth, collecting crystals of the target substance by centrifugation or concentration, and recycling the fermentation broth to the fermentation tank. For example, in the apparatus shown in Fig. 1, there can be used a method of circulating fermentation broth containing the target substance and cells via the line A, concentrating crystals of the target substance by centrifugation B, extracting the crystals from the line C, and recycling the fermentation broth to the fermentation tank via the line D. In such a method, the cells may be or may not be recycled to the fermentation tank. For the centrifugation of the crystals, a liquid cyclone is preferably used (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 5-92944). Furthermore, for the production of a nucleic acid, by allowing purine nucleoside phosphorylase and phosphoribosyltransferase to act on inosine or guanosine prepared by the method of the present invention, 5'-inosinic acid or 5'-guanylic acid can be obtained. Moreover, it is also possible to phosphorylate the purine nucleoside produced using the microorganism usable for the present invention by allowing phosphotransferase to act on the purine nucleoside to produce a purine nucleotide (nucleoside 5'-phosphoric acid ester) (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2000-295996). For example, the method for producing a purine nucleotide using an Escherichia bacterium into which a gene encoding inosine guanosine kinase of Escherichia coli is introd uced (WO91/08286) and the method for producing a purine nucleotide using Corynebacterium ammoniagenes into which a gene encoding inosine guanosine kinase of Exiguobacterium acetylicum is introduced (WO96/30501) can be used. Moreover, it is also possible to produce a purine nucleotide (nucleoside 5'-phosphoric acid ester) by allowing a microorganism having an ability to produce a nucleoside 5'-phosphoric acid ester or acid phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.2) to act on the purine nucleoside produced by using the microorganism usable for the present invention and a phosphate donor selected from the group consisting of polyphosphoric acid, phenyl phosphate and carbamyl phosphate. Although the microorganism having an ability to produce a nucleoside 5'-phosphoric acid ester is not particularly limited so long as a microorganism having an ability to convert a purine nucleoside into a purine nucleotide is chosen, examples include, for example, the microorganism disclosed in International Patent Publication WO96/37603. Moreover, Escherichia blattae JCM 1650, Serratia ficaria ATCC 33105, Klebsiella planticola IFO 14939 (ATCC 33531), Klebsiella pneumoniae IFO 3318 (ATCC 8724), Klebsiella terrigena IFO 14941 (ATCC 33257), Morganella morganii IFO 3168, Enterobacter aerogenes IFO 12010, Enterobacter aerogenes IFO 13534 (ATCC 13048), Chromobacterium fluviatile IAM 13652, Chromobacterium violaceum IFO 12614, Cedecea lapagei JCM 1684, Cedecea davisiae JCM 1685, Cedecea neteri JCM 5909, and so forth disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 07-231793 can also be used. As the acid phosphatase, for example, those disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2002-000289 can be used, and an acid phosphatase of which affinity to a nucleoside is increased (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 10-201481), a mutant acid phosphatase of which nucleotidase activity is decreased (WO96/37603), a mutant acid phosphatase of which phosphoric acid ester hydrolysis activity is decreased (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2001-245676) and so forth can be more preferably used. It is also possible to obtain a purine nucleotide by chemically phosphorylating a purine nucleoside produced using the microorganism usable for the present invention (Bulletin of the Chemical Society of Japan, 42, 3505). Moreover, a method of obtaining GMP by coupling the microorganism having an XMP-producing ability usable for the present invention and XMP aminase activity using the ATP-regenerating system of a microorganism, and a method of obtaining IMP by coupling inosine kinase (Biosci. Biotech. Biochem., 51, 840 (1997); Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 63-230094) can also be used. Inosine, guanosine or purine nucleoside prepared by the method of the present invention used for the aforementioned preparation of purine nucleotide may be a purified product, or purine nucleoside fermentation broth, or a crude product containing a purine nucleoside. <2> Microorganisms usable for the present invention The microorganism used for the present invention is not particularly limited, so long as a microorganism having an ability to produce an L-amino acid or nucleic acid, and able to accumulate the L-amino acid or nucleic acid in a liquid medium when it is cultured in the medium is chosen. The amount of the L-amino acid or nucleic acid to be accumulated is not also particularly limited so long as it can be accumulated in such an amount that it can be collected from the medium. However, the microorganism preferably has an ability to crystallize the target substance in the medium, and it is desirable that the microorganism can accumulate the target substance, for example, at a concentration higher than the concentrations described in Tables 1 and 2. For example, when the pH of an aqueous solution containing L-glutamic acid is reduced, the solubility of L-glutamic acid markedly decreases around pKa (4.25) of the γ-carboxyl group, and is the lowest at the isoelectric point (pH 3.2). Although it also depends on the medium composition, L-glutamic acid usually dissolves in an amount of 10 to 20 g/L at pH 3.2, 30 to 40 g/L at pH 4.0, and 50 to 60 g/L at pH 4.7, at about 30°C. As the microorganism usable for the present invention or a parent strain which is used to derive the microorganism, microorganisms belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae, typical examples of which are Escherichia bacteria and Pantoea bacteria, coryneform bacteria, and so forth can be used. In addition, methanol-utilizing bacteria such as Methylophilus bacteria and Methylobacillus bacteria, which can produce L-amino acid from methanol, may also be used. Further examples of microorganisms belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae include enterobacteria belonging to γ-proteobacteria such as those belonging to the genus Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Serratia, Erwinia, Salmonella, Morganella, or the like, and examples of other microorganisms include Alicyclobacillus bacteria, Bacillus bacteria, yeasts belonging to the genus Saccharomyces, Candida or the like, and so forth. As the Escherichia bacteria, those mentioned in the work of Neidhardt et al. (Neidhardt, F.C. et al., Escherichia coli and Salmonella Typhimurium, American Society for Microbiology, Washington D.C., 1208, table 1), such as Escherichia coli, can be utilized. Examples of wild-type strains of Escherichia coli include, for example, the K12 strain and derivatives thereof, Escherichia coli MG1655 strain (ATCC No. 47076), W3110 strain (ATCC No. 27325), and so forth. They are available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Address: P.O. Box 1549, Manassas, VA 20108, United States of America). That is, registration numbers are given to each of the strains, and the strains can be ordered by using these registration numbers. The registration numbers of the strains are listed in the catalogue of the American Type Culture Collection (refer to http://www.atcc.org/). Furthermore, examples of the Enterobacter bacteria include Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter aerogenes and so forth, and examples of the Pantoea bacteria include Pantoea ananatis. Some species of Enterobacter agglomerans have been recently re-classified into Pantoea agglomerans, Pantoea ananatis, Pantoea stewartii or the like, based on the nucleotide sequence analysis of 16S rRNA, etc.. Both of the Enterobacter bacteria and Pantoea bacteria may be used so long as the chosen bacterium is classified into the family Enterobacteriaceae. When a Pantoea ananatis strain is bred by a genetic engineering technique, Pantoea ananatis AJ13355 strain (FERM BP-6614), AJ13356 strain (FERM BP-6615), AJ13601 strain (FERM BP-7207) and derivatives thereof can be used. These strains were identified as Enterobacter agglomerans when they were isolated, and deposited as Enterobacter agglomerans. However, they were recently re-classified as Pantoea ananatis on the basis of nucleotide sequencing of 16S rRNA and so forth as described above. Specific examples of the Methylophilus bacteria include Methylophilus methylotrophus, and typical examples of Methylophilus methylotrophus include the AS1 strain (NCIMB 10515) and so forth. The Methylophilus methylotrophus AS1 strain is available from the National Collections of Industrial and Marine Bacteria (Address: NCIMB Lts., Torry Research Station, 135, Abbey Road, Aberdeen AB9 8DG, United Kingdom). Specific examples of the Methylobacillus bacteria include Methylobacillus glycogenes, Methylobacillus flagellatum, and so forth. Examples of Methylobacillus glycogenes include the T-11 strain (NCIMB 11375), ATCC 21276 strain, ATCC 21371 strain, ATR80 strain (described in Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol., vol. 42, pp.67-72, 1994), A513 strain (described in Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol., vol. 42, pp.67-72 (1994)), and so forth.

Examples of Methylobacillus flagellatum include the KT strain (described in Arch. Microbiol., vol. 149, pp.441-446, 1988) and so forth. The coryneform bacteria are a group of microorganisms defined in Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology, 8th Ed., p.599 (1974), and microorganisms classified into such aerobic, Gram-positive and nonacid-fast bacilli which are unable to sporulate can be used. The coryneform bacteria include bacteria which have previously been classified into the genus Brevibacterium but are presently united into the genus Corynebacterium (Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 41:255-260 (1991)), and bacteria belonging to the genus Brevibacterium or Microbacterium, which are closely related to the genus Corynebacterium. Specific examples of such coryneform bacteria include the following: Corynebacterium acetoacidophilumCorynebacterium acetoglutamicumCorynebacterium alkanolyticumCorynebacterium callunaeCorynebacterium glutamicumCorynebacterium liliumCorynebacterium melassecolaCorynebacterium thermoaminogenes (Corynebacterium efficiens)Corynebacterium herculisBrevibacterium divaricatumBrevibacterium flavumBrevibacterium immariophilumBrevibacterium lactofermentumBrevibacterium roseumBrevibacterium saccharolyticumBrevibacterium thiogenitalisCorynebacterium ammoniagenesBrevibacterium albumBrevibacterium cerinumMicrobacterium ammoniaphilum Specific examples of these bacteria include the following strains: Corynebacterium acetoacidophilum ATCC 13870Corynebacterium acetoglutamicum ATCC 15806Corynebacterium alkanolyticum ATCC 21511Corynebacterium callunae ATCC 15991Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13020, ATCC 13032, ATCC 13060Corynebacterium lilium ATCC 15990Corynebacterium melassecola ATCC 17965Corynebacterium efficiens AJ12340 (FERM BP-1539)Corynebacterium herculis ATCC 13868Brevibacterium divaricatum ATCC 14020Brevibacterium flavum ATCC 13826, ATCC 14067, AJ12418 (FERM BP-2205)Brevibacterium immariophilum ATCC 14068Brevibacterium lactofermentum ATCC 13869 (Corynebacterium glutamicum TCC 13869)Brevibacterium roseum ATCC 13825Brevibacterium saccharolyticum ATCC 14066Brevibacterium thiogenitalis ATCC 19240Brevibacterium ammoniagenes ATCC 6871, ATCC 6872Brevibacterium album ATCC 15111Brevibacterium cerinum ATCC 15112Microbacterium ammoniaphilum ATCC 15354 These strains are available from, for example, the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Address: P.O. Box 1549, Manassas, VA 2010812301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Maryland 20852, United States of America). The AJ12340 strain was deposited on October 27, 1987 in National Institute of Bioscience and Human Technology of Agency of Industrial Science and Technology (currently independent administrative agency, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, International Patent Organism Depositary, Tsukuba Central 6, 1-1, Higashi 1-Chome, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki-ken, 305-5466, Japan), with a deposit number of FERM BP-1539 under the provisions of Budapest Treaty. The AJ12418 strain was deposited on January 5, 1989 in National Institute of Bioscience and Human Technology of Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, with a deposit number of FERM BP-2205 under the provisions of the Budapest Treaty. When Bacillus bacteria are used, examples thereof include Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus pumilus, and so forth. Examples of Bacillus subtilis include Bacillus subtilis 168 Marburg strain (ATCC 6051), Bacillus subtilis PY79 strain (Plasmid, 1984, 12, 1-9), and so forth.

Examples of Bacillus pumilus include Bacillus pumilus Gottheil No. 3218 (ATCC 21005) (U.S. Patent No. 3,616,206), and so forth. Hereinafter, methods for imparting an L-amino acid-or nucleic acid-producing ability to such parent strains as mentioned above are described. To impart the ability to produce an L-amino acid or a nucleic acid, methods conventionally employed in the breeding of coryneform bacteria or bacteria of the genus Escherichia (see "Amino Acid Fermentation", Gakkai Shuppan Center (Ltd.), 1st Edition, published May 30, 1986, pp. 77-100) can be used. Such methods include methods of acquiring an auxotrophic mutant, an analogue-resistant strain, or a metabolic regulation mutant, or constructing a recombinant strain so that it overexpresses an L-amino acid or nucleic acid biosynthesis enzyme. Here, in the breeding of an L-amino acid-producing bacteria, one or more of the above described properties such as auxotrophy, analogue-resistance, or metabolic regulation mutation may be imparted. Expression of one or more L-amino acid biosynthesis enzymes may be enhanced. Furthermore, the methods of imparting properties such as an auxotrophic mutation, analogue resistance, or metabolic regulation mutation may be combined with the methods of enhancing the biosynthesis enzymes. An auxotrophic mutant strain, L-amino acid or nucleic acid analogue-resistant strain, or metabolic regulation mutant strain with an ability to produce an L-amino acid or nucleic acid can be obtained by subjecting a parent strain or wild-type strain to a conventional mutagenesis, such as exposure to X-rays or UV irradiation, or treatment with a mutagen such as N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, etc., and then selecting those which exhibit an autotrophy, analogue resistance, or metabolic regulation mutation and which also have the ability to produce an L-amino acid from the obtained mutant stains. An auxotrophic mutant strain, L-amino acid analogue-resistant strain, or metabolic regulation mutant strain with an ability to produce an L-amino acid can be obtained by subjecting a parent strain or wild-type strain to a conventional mutagenesis, such as exposure to X-rays or UV irradiation, or treatment with a mutagen such as N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine or ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), etc., and then selecting those which exhibit an autotrophy, analogue resistance, or metabolic regulation mutation and which also have the ability to produce an L-amino acid from the obtained mutant stains. Methods for imparting L-amino acid-producing ability and amino acid-producing bacteria will be specifically exemplified below. L-Tryptophan, L-phenylalanine, and L-tyrosine are all aromatic amino acids and share a common biosynthesis pathway. Examples of the genes encoding the biosynthesis enzymes for these aromatic amino acids include deoxyarabino-heptulosonate phosphate synthase (aroG), 3-dehydroquinate synthase (aroB), shikimic acid dehydrogenase (aroE), shikimate kinase (aroL), 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (aroA), and chorismate synthase (aroC) (European Patent Laid-open No. 763127). It is known that these genes are controlled by the tyrosine repressor (tyrR), so activity of an aromatic amino acid biosynthesis enzyme may also be increased by deleting the tyrR gene (see European Patent Laid-open No. 763127). The abbreviations in parentheses after the enzyme names represent the gene names (the same shall apply to the same occasions hereafter). In order to enhance the productivity of each of the target aromatic amino acids, biosynthesis of an amino acid other than the target amino acid may be attenuated. For example, when the target amino acid is L-tryptophan, biosynthetic pathways of L-phenylalanine and/or L-tyrosine may be attenuated (U.S. Patent No. 4,371,614). Furthermore, 3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosonate-7-phosphate synthetase (aroF, aroG) is subject to feedback inhibition by aromatic amino acids. Therefore, the enzyme may be modified so that it is not subject to the feedback inhibition. An aromatic L-amino acid-producing bacterium can be obtained by, for example, introducing a mutant aroF in which the L-aspartic acid at position 147 or the L-serine at position 181 is replaced by another amino acid, or introducing a mutant aroG gene in which the L-aspartic acid at position 146 from the N-terminus, the L-methionine at position 147, the L-proline at position 150 or the L-alanine at position 202, or both the L-methionine at position 157 and the L-alanine at position 219 are replaced by other amino acid(s) (European Patent Laid-open No. 0488424). An example of a gene involved in the synthesis of branched chain amino acids is the ilvGMEDA operon, and this operon is subject to expression control (attenuation) by L-valine and/or L-isoleucine and/or L-leucine. Therefore, productivity of a microorganism for these L-amino acids can be improved by introducing into the microorganism the ilvGMEDA operon in which the region required for attenuation is removed or mutated. Aromatic amino acids and branched chain amino acids share a common biosynthesis system, and therefore it is preferable to use a strain in which a biosynthesis system specific for an aromatic amino acid or branched chain amino acid other than the target L-amino acid is attenuated. For example, a strain which can efficiently produce an target L-amino acid can be obtained by attenuating the biosynthesis system of L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine when the target amino acid is L-tryptophan, attenuating the biosynthesis system of L-tryptophan and L-tyrosine when the target amino acid is L-phenylalanine, attenuating the biosynthesis system of L-leucine and L-isoleucine when the target amino acid is L-valine, attenuating the biosynthesis system of L-valine and L-leucine when the target amino acid is L-isoleucine, or attenuating the biosynthesis system of L-valine and L-isoleucine when the target amino acid is L-leucine. Attenuation of a biosynthesis system can be attained by introducing a mutation into a gene coding for an enzyme of the biosynthesis system or obtaining a strain which requires an L-amino acid synthesized by a biosynthesis system desired to be attenuated using a synthetic medium containing that L-amino acid. Methods for imparting L-amino acid-producing ability and microorganisms to which L-amino acid-producing ability is imparted, and which are usable for the present invention are exemplified below. L-Tryptophan-producing bacteria Examples of L-tryptophan-producing bacteria and parent strains which can be used to derive them include, but are not limited to, strains belonging to the genus Escherichia, such as E. coliJP4735/pMU3028 (DSM10122) and JP6015/pMU91 (DSM10123) which are deficient in tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase encoded by mutant trpS gene (U.S. Patent No. 5,756,345), E. coli SV164 (pGH5) having a serA allele encoding phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase not subject to feedback inhibition by serine and a trpE allele encoding anthranilate synthase not subject to feedback inhibition by tryptophan (U.S. Patent No. 6,180,373); E. coli AGX17 (pGX44) (NRRL B-12263) and AGX6(pGX50)aroP (NRRL B-12264) deficient in the enzyme tryptophanase (U.S. Patent No. 4,371,614), E. coli AGX17/pGX50,pACKG4-pps in which a phosphoenolpyruvate-producing ability is enhanced (WO97/08333, U.S. Patent No. 6,319,696), and so forth. L-Tryptophan-producing bacteria belonging to the genus Escherichia which have enhanced activity of the protein encoded by the yedA or yddG gene may also be used (U.S. Patent Published Applications 2003/0148473 A1 and 2003/0157667 A1). Examples of L-tryptophan-producing bacteria and parent strains which can be used to derive them also include strains in which one or more activities of the following enzymes are enhanced: anthranilate synthase (trpE), phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (serA), and tryptophan synthase (trpAB). The anthranilate synthase and phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase both are subject to feedback inhibition by L-tryptophan and L-serine, therefore a mutation desensitizing the feedback inhibition may be introduced into these enzymes. Specific examples of strains having such a mutation include E. coli SV164 which harbors desensitized anthranilate synthase and a transformant strain SV164(pGH5) obtained by introducing into the E. coli SV164 the plasmid pGH5, which contains a mutant serA gene encoding a feedback inhibition-desensitized phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase. Examples of L-tryptophan-producing bacteria and parent strains which can be used to derive them also include a strain which has enhanced activity of 3-phosphoserine phosphatase (serB) (U.S. Patent No. 4,371,614), a strain which has enhanced activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pckA) (WO2004/090125) and a strain which constitutively expresses the maleate synthase-isocitrate lyase-isocitrate dehydrogenase-kinase/phosphatase operon (ace operon) or in which expression of this operon is enhanced (WO2005/103275). Examples of L-tryptophan-producing bacteria and parent strains for deriving them also include strains into which the tryptophan operon containing a gene encoding inhibition-desensitized anthranilate synthase has been introduced (Japanese Patent Laid-open Nos. 57-71397, 62-244382, U.S. Patent No. 4,371,614). Moreover, L-tryptophan-producing ability may be imparted by enhancing expression of a gene which encodes tryptophan synthase in the tryptophan operon (trpBA). Tryptophan synthase consists of α and β subunits which are encoded by the trpA and trpB genes, respectively. In addition, L-tryptophan-producing ability may be improved by enhancing expression of the isocitrate lyase-malate synthase operon (WO2005/103275). As coryneform bacteria, Corynebacterium glutamicum AJ12118 (FERM BP-478, Japanese Patent No. 01681002), which is resistant to sulfaguanidine, the coryneform bacterium introduced with the tryptophan operon (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 63-240794), and the coryneform bacterium introduced with a gene coding for shikimate kinase derived from a coryneform bacterium (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 01-994749) can be used. L-Phenylalanine-producing bacteria Examples of L-phenylalanine-producing bacteria and parent strains which can be used to derive them include, but are not limited to, strains belonging to the genus Escherichia, such as E. coli AJ12739 (tyrA::Tn10, tyrR) (VKPM B-8197), E. coli HW1089 (ATCC 55371) harboring a mutant pheA34 gene (U.S. Patent No. 5,354,672), E. coli MWEC101-b (Korean Patent No. 8903681), E. coli NRRL B-12141, NRRL B-12145, NRRL B-12146, and NRRL B-12147 (U.S. Patent No. 4,407,952). Also, as a parent strain, E. coli K-12 [W3110 (tyrA)/pPHAB (FERM BP-3566), E. coli K-12 [W3110 (tyrA)/pPHAD] (FERM BP-12659), E. coli K-12 [W3110 (tyrA)/pPHATerm] (FERM BP-12662) and E. coli K-12 [W3110 (tyrA)/pBR-aroG4, pACMAB] named as AJ12604 (FERM BP-3579) may be used (European Patent Publication No. 488424 B1). Furthermore, L-phenylalanine-producing bacteria belonging to the genus Escherichia with an enhanced activity of the protein encoded by the yedA gene or the yddG gene may also be used (U.S. Patent Publiched Applications No. 2003/0148473 A1 and 2003/0157667 A1). As phenylalanine-producing coryneform bacteria, the Cornebacterium glutamicum BPS-13 (FERM BP-1777), K77 (FERM BP-2062), and K78 (FERM BP-2063) (European Patent Laid-open No. 331145, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 02-303495), of which phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase or pyruvate kinase activity is reduced, tyrosine-auxotrophic strain (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 05-049489), and so forth can be used. A bacterium which efficiently produces phenylalanine can also be obtained by modifying a bacterium so that the bacterium incorporate by-products, for example, by increasing the expression of the L-tryptophan uptake gene, tnaB or mtr, or the L-tyrosine uptake gene, tyrP (European Patent No. 1484410). L-Tyrosine-producing bacteria Examples of tyrosine-producing bacteria include Escherichia bacteria with a desensitized prephenate dehydratase gene (tyrA). The expression product of this gene is desensitized to inhibition by tyrosine (European Patent Application Laid-open No. 1616940). L-Valine-producing bacteria Examples of L-valine-producing bacteria and parent strains which can be used to derive L-valine-producing bacteria include, but are not limited to, strains which have been modified to overexpress the ilvGMEDA operon (U.S. Patent No. 5,998,178). It is preferred that the region in the ilvGMEDA operon which is required for attenuation is removed so that expression of the operon is not attenuated by the L-valine that is produced. Furthermore, it is preferred that the ilvA gene in the operon is disrupted so that threonine deaminase activity is decreased. Examples of L-valine-producing bacteria which can be used to derive L-valine-producing bacteria also include mutant strains with amino-acyl t-RNA synthetase having a mutation (U.S. Patent No. 5,658,766). For example, E. coli VL1970, which has a mutation in the ileS gene encoding isoleucine tRNA synthetase, can be used. E. coli VL1970 was deposited at the Russian National Collection of Industrial Microorganisms (VKPM) (1 Dorozhny proezd., 1 Moscow 117545, Russia) on June 24, 1988 under an accession number VKPM B-4411. Furthermore, mutants requiring lipoic acid for growth and/or lacking H+-ATPase can also be used as parent strains (WO96/06926). Examples of L-valine-producing bacteria of coryneform bacteria include, for example, strains modified so that expression of a gene encoding an L-valine biosynthetic enzyme is enhanced. Examples of the L-valine biosynthesis enzyme include enzymes encoded by genes present on the ilvBNC operon, that is, acetohydroxy acid synthetase encoded by ilvBN and isomero-reductase encoded by ilvc (WO00/50624). Since the ilvBNC operon is subject to expression regulation by L-valine and/or L-isoleucine and/or L-leucine, it is desirable to eliminate attenuation to avoid expression suppression by L-valine that is produced. Impartation of L-valine-producing ability to coryneform bacteria may be performed by decreasing or eliminating activity of at least one kind of enzyme which is involved in a metabolic pathway that decreases L-valine production. For example, decrease of the activity of threonine dehydratase involved in the L-leucine synthesis, or activity of an enzyme that involved in D-panthothenate synthesis is contemplated (WO00/50624). Examples of methods for imparting L-valine-producing ability also include imparting resistance to an amino acid analogue or the like. Examples include, for example, mutant strains which are auxotrophic for L-isoleucine and L-methionine, and resistant to D-ribose, purine ribonucleoside or pyrimidine ribonucleoside, and have an ability to produce L-valine (FERM P-1841, FERM P-29, Japanese Patent Publication No. 53-025034), mutant strains resistant to polyketides (FERM P-1763, FERM P-1764, Japanese Patent Publication No. 06-065314), and mutant strains resistant to L-valine in a medium containing acetic acid as the sole carbon source and sensitive to pyruvic acid analogues (fluoropyruvic acid etc.) in a medium containing glucose as the sole carbon source (FERM BP-3006, BP-3007, Japanese Patent No. 3006929). L-Isoleucine-producing bacteria Examples of L-isoleucine-producing bacteria and parent strains which can be used to derive L-isoleucine-producing bacteria include, but are not limited to, mutants having resistance to 6-dimethylaminopurine (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 5-304969), mutants having resistance to an isoleucine analogue such as thiaisoleucine and isoleucine hydroxamate, and mutants additionally having resistance to DL-ethionine and/or arginine hydroxamate (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 5-130882). In addition, recombinant strains transformed with genes encoding proteins involved in L-isoleucine biosynthesis, such as threonine deaminase and acetohydroxy acid synthase, can also be used as parent strains (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2-458, French Patent No. 0356739, and U.S. Patent No. 5,998,178). Examples of L-isoleucine-producing strains of coryneform bacteria include the coryneform bacterium of which brnE gene coding for a branched chain amino acid excretion protein is amplified (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2001-169788), the coryneform bacterium imparted with L-isoleucine-producing ability by protoplast fusion with an L-lysine-producing bacterium (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 62-74293), the coryneform bacterium of which homoserine dehydrogenase is enhanced (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 62-91193), the threonine hydroxamete resistant strain (Japanese Patent Laid-open No 62-195293), α-ketomalonic acid resistant strain (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 61-15695), and the methyl lysine resistant strain (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 61-15696). L-Leucine-producing bacteria Examples of L-leucine-producing bacteria and parent strains for deriving L-leucine-producing bacteria include, but are not limited to, Escherichia bacteria, such as E. coli strains resistant to leucine (for example, the strain 57 (VKPM B-7386, U.S. Patent No. 6,124,121)) or leucine analogues including β-2-thienylalanine, 3-hydroxyleucine, 4-azaleucine and 5,5,5-trifluoroleucine (Japanese Patent Publication No. 62-34397 and Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 8-70879); E. coli strains obtained by the genetic engineering method described in WO96/06926; and E. coli H-9068 (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 8-70879). The bacterium usable for the present invention may also be improved by enhancing the expression of one or more genes involved in L-leucine biosynthesis. Examples of such genes include genes of the leuABCD operon, which are preferably represented by a mutant leuA gene coding for isopropylmalate synthase desensitized to feedback inhibition by L-leucine (U.S. Patent No. 6,403,342). In addition, the bacterium usable for the present invention may be improved by enhancing the expression of one or more genes coding for proteins which excrete L-amino acid from the bacterial cell. Examples of such genes include the b2682 and b2683 genes (ygaZH genes) (European Patent Laid-open No. 1239041 A2). Examples of L-leucine-producing strains of coryneform bacteria include the 2-thiazolealanine and β-hydroxyleucine-resistant strains (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 8-266295), the valine analogue-resistant strain (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 63-248392), the valine auxotrophic strain (Japanese Patent Publication No. 38-4395), the S-(2-aminoethyl)-L-cysteine (AEC) resistant strain (Japanese Patent Publication No. 51-37347), and the phenylalanine, valine and isoleucine auxotrophic strain (Japanese Patent Publication No. 54-36233). L-Glutamic acid-producing bacteria Preferred examples of L-glutamic acid-producing bacteria include strains in which expression of a gene encoding an L-glutamic acid biosynthetic enzyme is enhanced. Examples of such genes include, but are not limited to, genes encoding glutamate dehydrogenase (gdhA), glutamine synthetase (glnA), glutamate synthetase (gltAB), isocitrate dehydrogenase (icdA), aconitate hydratase (acnA, acnB), citrate synthase (gltA), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (ppc), pyruvate dehydrogenase (aceEF, lpdA), pyruvate kinase (pykA, pykF), phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (ppsA), enolase (eno), phosphoglyceromutase (pgmA, pgmI), phosphoglycerate kinase (pgk), glyceraldehyde-3-phophate dehydrogenase (gapA), triose phosphate isomerase (tpiA), fructose bisphosphate aldolase (fbp), phosphofructokinase (pfkA, pfkB), glucose phosphate isomerase (pgi), methylcitrate synthase (prpC) and so forth. Examples of strains which have been modified so that expression of the citrate synthetase gene, the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase gene, the isocitrate dehydrogenase gene, the pyruvate dehydrogenase gene, and/or the glutamate dehydrogenase gene is enhanced include those disclosed in European Patent Laid-open Nos. 1078989, 955368, and 952221. The modification for imparting L-glutamic acid producing ability may be attained by decreasing or eliminating activity of an enzyme that catalyzes a reaction branching off from the L-glutamic acid biosynthesis pathway and producing a compound other than L-glutamic acid. Examples of such an enzyme that catalyzes a reaction branching off from the L-glutamic acid biosynthesis pathway and producing a compound other than L-glutamic acid include isocitrate lyase (aceA), α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (sucA), acetohydroxy acid synthase (ilvG), acetolactate synthase (ilvI), formate acetyltransferase (pfl), lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), glutamate decarboxylase (gadAB), 1-pyrroline-5-carboxilate dehydrogenase (putA), and so forth. For example, in order to decrease the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity, a modification may be performed by using the sucA (odhA) gene coding for the Elo subunit of the enzyme. Examples of strains with decreased α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity include, for example, the following strains: Brevibacterium lactofermentum ΔS strain (WO95/34672)Brevibacterium lactofermentum AJ12821 (FERM BP-4172; French Patent No. 9401748)Brevibacterium flavum AJ12822 (FERM BP-4173; French Patent No. 9401748)Corynebacterium glutamicum (FERM BP-4174; French Patent No. 9401748)Pantoea ananatis AJ13601 (FERM BP-7207)Klebsiella planticola AJ13410 (FERM BP-6617)Pantoea ananatis AJ13355 (FERM BP-6614)Pantoea ananatis AJ13356 is deficient in α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity as a result of disruption of the αKGDH-E1 subunit gene (sucA). This strain was identified as Enterobacter agglomerans when it was isolated and deposited as the Enterobacter agglomerans AJ13356. However, it was recently re-classified as Pantoea ananatis on the basis of nucleotide sequencing of 16S rRNA and so forth. Although AJ13356 was deposited at the aforementioned depository as Enterobacter agglomerans, it is described as Pantoea ananatis in this specification. Furthermore, the ability to produce L-glutamic acid in coryneform bacteria can also be achieved by a method of amplifying the yggB gene (NCgl 1221;NP_600492. Reports small-conductance. [gi:19552490], WO2006/070944), and a method of introducing a mutant yggB gene in which a mutation is introduced into the coding region. The microorganism used for the production method of the present invention may be a microorganism modified so that D-xylose-5-phosphate phosphoketolase activity and/or fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase activity is enhanced. Either one or both of the D-xylose-5-phosphate phosphoketolase activity and fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase activity may be activated. Examples of other methods for imparting or enhancing L-glutamic acid-producing ability include a method of imparting resistance to an organic acid analogue, a respiratory chain inhibitor, etc., and a method of imparting sensitivity to a cell wall synthesis inhibitor. Examples of such methods include the methods of imparting resistance to monofluoroacetic acid (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 50-113209), the method of resistance to adenine or thymine (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 57-065198), the method of attenuating urease (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 52-038088), the method of imparting resistance to malonic acid (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 52-038088), the method of imparting resistance to benzopyrones or naphthoquinones (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 56-1889), the method of imparting resistance to HOQNO (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 56-140895), the method of imparting resistance to α-ketomalonic acid (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 57-2689), the method of imparting resistance to guanidine (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 56-35981), the method of imparting sensitivity to penicillin (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 4-88994), and so forth. Specific examples of such resistant strains include the following strains: Brevibacterium flavum AJ3949 (FERM BP-2632; Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 50-113209)Corynebacterium glutamicum AJ11628 (FERM P-5736; Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 57-065198)Brevibacterium flavum AJ11355 (FERM P-5007; Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 56-1889)Corynebacterium glutamicum AJ11368 (FERM P-5020; Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 56-1889)Brevibacterium flavum AJ11217 (FERM P-4318; Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 57-2689)Corynebacterium glutamicum AJ11218 (FERM P-4319; Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 57-2689)Brevibacterium flavum AJ11564 (FERM BP-5472; Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 56-140895)Brevibacterium flavum AJ11439 (FERM BP-5136; Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 56-35981)Corynebacterium glutamicum H7684 (FERM BP-3004; Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 04-88994)Brevibacterium lactofermentum AJ11426 (FERM P-5123; Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 56-048890)Corynebacterium glutamicum AJ11440 (FERM P-5137; Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 56-048890)Brevibacterium lactofermentum AJ11796 (FERM P-6402; Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 58-158192) L-Threonine-producing bacteria Preferred examples of microorganisms having L-threonine-producing ability preferably used for the present invention include bacteria belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae in which an activity of L-threonine biosynthesis system enzyme is enhanced. Examples of genes coding for L-threonine biosynthetic enzymes include the aspartokinase III gene (lysC), aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase gene (asd), aspartokinase I gene (thrA), homoserine kinase gene (thrB), and threonine synthase gene (thrC) encoded by the thr operon. Two or more kinds of these genes may be introduced. The genes coding for the L-threonine biosynthetic enzymes may be introduced into an Enterobacteriaceae bacterium with decreased threonine decomposition. Examples of the Escherichia bacterium with decreased threonine decomposition include, for example, the TDH6 strain which is deficient in threonine dehydrogenase activity (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2001-346578), and so forth. The activities of the L-threonine biosynthetic enzymes are inhibited by the end product L-threonine, and therefore L-threonine biosynthetic enzymes are preferably modified so as to be desensitized to feedback inhibition by L-threonine when constructing L-threonine producing strains. The above-described thrA, thrB and thrC genes constitute the threonine operon which has an attenuator structure. The expression of the threonine operon is inhibited by isoleucine and threonine in the culture medium and also repressed by attenuation. This attenuation can be eliminated or reduced by removing a leader sequence or attenuator in the attenuation region (Lynn, S.P., Burton, W.S., Donohue, T.J., Gould, R.M., Gumport, R.I., and Gardner, J.F.J., Mol. Biol. 194:59-69 (1987); WO02/26993; WO2005/049808). The native promoter present in the upstream region of the threonine operon may be replaced by a non-native promoter (WO98/04715), or the threonine operon may be constructed so that expression of the threonine biosynthetic genes is controlled by the repressor and promoter of λ-phage (European Patent No. 0593792). Furthermore, mutant Escherichia bacteria that are desensitized to feedback inhibition by L-threonine can be obtained by selecting strains resistant to α-amino-β-hydroxyisovaleric acid (AHV). It is preferable that the copy number of the feedback-resistant threonine operon is increased, or the expression of the modified operon is increased by connecting it to a potent promoter. The copy number can be increased by using, in addition to amplification using a plasmid, transposon, Mu-phage, or the like so that the operon is transferred onto the chromosome. The gene encoding aspartokinase III (lysC) is preferably modified so that the enzyme is desensitized to feedback inhibition by L-lysine. Such a modified lysC gene can be obtained by the method described in U.S. Patent No. 5,932,453. L-Threonine-producing bacteria can also be preferably obtained by enhancing expression of genes involved in the glycolytic pathway, TCA cycle, or respiratory chain, or genes that regulate expression of these genes, or genes involved in sugar uptake, besides the L-threonine biosynthetic enzyme genes. Examples of these genes that are effective for L-threonine production include the transhydrogenase gene (pntAB, European Patent No. 733712), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase gene (pepC, WO95/06114), phosphoenolpyruvate synthase gene (pps, European Patent No. 877090), and pyruvate carboxylase gene derived from coryneform bacterium or Bacillus bacterium (WO99/18228, European Patent Laid-open No. 1092776). L-Threonine-producing bacteria can also be preferably obtained by enhancing expression of a gene that imparts L-threonine resistance and/or a gene that imparts L-homoserine resistance, or by imparting L-threonine resistance and/or L-homoserine resistance to the host bacterium. Examples of the genes that impart the above-mentioned resistance include the rhtA gene (Res. Microbiol. 154:123-135 (2003)), rhtB gene (European Patent Laid-open No. 0994190), rhtC gene (European Patent Laid-open No. 1013765), yfiK gene, and yeaS gene (European Patent Laid-open No. 1016710). Exemplary methods for imparting L-threonine resistance to a host bacterium include those described in European Patent Laid-open No. 0994190 or WO90/04636. E. coli VKPM B-3996 (U.S. Patent No. 5,175,107) can be exemplified as an L-threonine-producing bacterium. The strain VKPM B-3996 was deposited on November 19, 1987 at the Russian National Collection of Industrial Microorganisms (VKPM), GNII Genetika (Russia, 117545 Moscow 1, Dorozhny proezd, 1) under the registration number VKPM B-3996. The VKPM B-3996 strain contains the plasmid pVIC40 (WO90/04636) which was obtained by inserting the threonine biosynthetic genes (threonine operon, thrABC) into a wide host range plasmid vector pAYC32 containing the streptomycin resistance marker (Chistorerdov, A.Y., and Tsygankov, Y.D., Plasmid, 16, 161-167 (1986)). In pVIC40, aspartokinase I-homoserine dehydrogenase I encoded by the thrA gene in the threonine operon is desensitized to feedback inhibition by threonine. E. coli VKPM B-5318 (refer to European Patent No. 0593792) can also be exemplified as L-threonine-producing bacterium. The VKPM B-5318 strain was deposited in the Russian National Collection of Industrial Microorganisms (VKPM) GNII Genetika (Russia, 117545 Moscow 1, Dorozhny proezd, 1) on May 3, 1990 under a registration number of VKPM B-5318. The VKPM B-5318 strain is prototrophic with regard to L-isoleucine, and harbors a recombinant plasmid DNA constructed so that the threonine operon, i.e., threonine biosynthesis genes, deficient in the attenuator region, which is an originally contained transcription regulation region, is located downstream from the λ phage-derived temperature-sensitive C1 repressor, PR-promoter, and the gene coding for N-terminal of Cro protein, and the expression of the threonine biosynthesis genes are regulated by the repressor and the promoter derived from λ phage. L-Glutamine-producing bacteria Examples of method for imparting L-glutamine-producing ability by breeding include, for example, a method of modifying a bacterium so that expression of a gene coding for an enzyme which is involved in L-glutamine biosynthesis is enhanced. Examples of the enzyme which is involoved in L-glutamine biosynthesis include, for example, glutamine synthetase and glutamate dehydrogenase (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2002-300887). Modification for imparting L-glutamine-producing ability may also be attained by reducing or deleting activity of an enzyme which catalyzes a reaction branching off from the biosynthesis pathway of L-glutamine and producing another compound. For example, it is conceivable to reduce intracellular glutaminase activity (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2004-187684). Examples of methods for imparting or enhancing L-glutamine-producing ability by breeding include imparting resistance to amino acid analogues and so forth. Examples further include imparting 6-diazo-5-oxo-norleucine resistance (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 3-232497), imparting purine analogue resistance and/or methionine sulfoxide resistance (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 61-202694), imparting α-ketomalonic acid resistance (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 56-151495), imparting resistance to a peptide containing glutamic acid (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2-186994) and so forth. Specific examples of coryneform bacteria having L-glutamine -producing ability include the following strains: Brevibacterium flavum AJ11573 (FERM P-5492, see Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 56-151495)Brevibacterium flavum AJ12210 (FERM P-8123, see Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 61-202694)Brevibacterium flavum AJ12212 (FERM P-8123, see Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 61-202694)Brevibacterium flavum AJ12418 (FERM-BP2205, see Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2-186994)Brevibacterium flavum DH18 (FERM P-11116, see Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 3-232497)Corynebacterium melassecola DH344 (FERM P-11117, see Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 3-232497)Corynebacterium glutamicum AJ11574 (FERM P-5493, see Japanese Patent Laid-open No. No. 56-151495) L-Cysteine-producing bacteria Examples of L-cysteine-producing bacteria include, but are not limited to, strains belonging to the genus Escherichia, such as E. coli JM15 which is transformed with different cysE alleles encoding feedback-resistant serine acetyltransferases (U.S. Patent No. 6,218,168, Russian Patent Application No. 2003121601), E. coli W3110 with overexpressed genes which encode proteins which promote excretion of substances toxic to cells (U.S. Patent No. 5,972,663), E. coli strains with reduced cysteine desulfohydrase activity (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 11-155571), E. coli W3110 with increased activity of a positive transcriptional regulator for cysteine regulon encoded by the cysB gene (WO01/27307A1), and so forth. In the L-amino acid-producing bacteria used for the preset invention, genes involved in sugar uptake, sugar metabolism (glycolytic pathway) and energy metabolism may be amplified in addition to the genes encoding characteristic biosynthesis enzymes. Examples of the genes involved in sugar metabolism include the genes coding for the enzymes of the glycolytic pathway and sugar uptake genes, and include glucose-6-phosphate isomerase gene (pgi, WO01/02542), phosphoenolpyruvate synthase gene (pps, European Patent Laid-open No. 877090), phosphoglucomutase gene (pgm,WO03/04598), fructose bisphosphate aldolase gene (fbp,WO03/04664), pyruvate kinase gene (pykF,WO03/008609), transaldolase gene (talB,WO03/008611), fumarase gene (fum, WO01/02545), phosphoenolpyruvate synthase gene (pps, European Patent Laid-open No. 877090), non-PTS sucrose uptake gene (csc, European Patent Laid-open No. 149911), and sucrose-assimilating gene (scrAB operon, WO90/04636). Examples of the genes encoding enzymes involved in energy metabolism include the transhydrogenase gene (pntAB, U.S. Patent No. 5,830,716) and cytochrome bo-type oxidase gene (cyoB, European Patent No. 1070376). Methods for imparting nucleic acid-producing ability to a microorganism and nucleic acid-producing bacteria will be exemplified below. A bacterium having an ability to produce a nucleic acid can be obtained by imparting, for example, purine nucleoside auxotrophy or resistance to a drug such as purine analogue to such bacteria as described above (Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 38-23099, 54-17033, 55-45199, 57-14160, 57-41915 and 59-42895). For example, a Bacillus bacterium having auxotrophy or drug resistance can be obtained by treating the bacterium with mutatgen which is used for usual mutagenesis treatment such as N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (NTG) or EMS (ethyl methanesulfonate). Examples of Bacillus bacteria which produce a purine nucleoside include the followings. As a specific example of inosine-producing strain belonging to the genus Bacillus, the Bacillus subtilis KMBS16 strain can be used. This strain is derived from the known Bacillus subtilis trpC2 strain (168 Marburg), wherein the purR gene encoding the purine operon repressor (purR::spc), the purA gene encoding succinyl-AMP synthase (purA::erm), and the deoD gene encoding purine nucleoside phosphorylase (deoD::kan) are disrupted (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2004-242610, U.S. Patent Published Application No. 2004166575 A1). The Bacillus subtilis AJ3772 strain (FERM P-2555, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 62-014794) and so forth may also be used. Examples of Bacillus bacteria having an ability to produce guanosine include the Bacillus bacterium which has increased IMP dehydrogenase activity (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 3-58787), Bacillus bacterium which is obtained by introducing a vector comprising a gene conferring resistance to purine analogue or decoyinine into an adenine auxotrophic mutant (Japanese Patent Publication No. 4-28357), and so forth. Examples of Bacillus bacteria which produce a purine nucleotide include the followings. As inosinic acid-producing Bacillus bacteria, inosine-producing strains of Bacillus subtilis which have attenuated phosphatase activity have been reported (Uchida, K. et al., Agr. Biol. Chem., 1961, 25, 804-805; Fujimoto, M., Uchida, K., Agr. Biol. Chem., 1965, 29, 249-259). Examples of guanylic acid-producing bacteria include mutants of Bacillus bacteria which have adenine auxotrophy, resistance to decoyinine or methionine sulfoxide and an ability to produce 5'-guanylic acid (guanosine-5'-monophosphate, henceforth referred to as "GMP") (Japanese Patent Publication No. 56-12438). Furthermore, a xanthylic acid-producing bacterium can be constructed by the method used for breeding of coryneform bacteria of which typical example is Corynebacterium ammoniagenes. For example, by obtaining a PRPP amidotransferase-enhanced strain (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 8-168383), an aliphatic amino acid-resistant strain (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 4-262790), or a dehydroproline-resistant strain (South Korean Patent Unexamined Publication No. 2003-56490), a xanthylic acid-producing bacterium can be constructed. Moreover, examples of a method for breeding Bacillus bacteria which have an ability to produce a purine-derived substance also include enhancing activity of an enzyme which is involved in purine biosynthesis which is common to the biosynthesis of purine nucleosides and purine nucleotides, i.e., purine biosynthesis enzyme, in bacterial cells. The activity of the enzyme in the cells is preferably increased to a level greater than that of an unmodified strain of Bacillus bacterium, for example, a wild-type Bacillus bacterium. The phrase "activity is increased" encompasses, for example, when number of enzyme molecules per cell is increased, and when specific activity per enzyme molecule is increased, and so forth. For example, the activity can be increased by increasing expression amount of the gene of the enzyme. Examples of the enzyme involved in the purine biosynthesis include, for example, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase (PRPP synthetase [EC: 2.7.6.1]), and so forth. Some of the catabolites produced by metabolism of sugar sources such as glucose that flow into the pentose phosphate pathway are converted into ribose-5-phosphate via ribulose-5-phosphate. From the biosynthesized ribose-5-phosphate, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) is produced, which is an indispensable precursor for purine nucleoside, histidine and tryptophan biosyntheses. Specifically, ribose-5-phosphate is converted into PRPP by phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase. Therefore, an ability to produce purine-derived substance can be imparted to a Bacillus bacterium by modifying it so that the activity of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase thereof is increased. The phrase "activity of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase is increased" means that the activity of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase increases as compared to that of an unmodified strain such as a wild strain or a parent strain. The activity of the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase can be measured by, for example, the method of Switzer et al. (Methods Enzymol., 1978, 51, 3-11) or Roth et al. (Methods Enzymol., 1978, 51, 12-17). A Bacillus bacterium in which the activity of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase is increased can be produced by, for example, increasing expression of a gene encoding the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase in a Bacillus bacterium according to a method of using a plasmid or integrating the gene into a chromosome, which can be performed in the same manner as that of the method described in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2004-242610. On the other hand, when PRPP which is an indispensable precursor for purine nucleoside, histidine and tryptophan biosyntheses is once produced, some of it is converted into purine nucleotides and purine nucleosides by the enzymes involved in the purine biosynthesis. Examples of genes encoding such enzymes include the genes of the purine operon from Bacillus subtilis, specifically, genes of the purEKB-purC(orf)QLF- purMNH(J)-purD operon (Ebbole D.J. and Zalkin H., J. Biol. Chem., 1987, 262, 17, 8274-87) (at present, also called purEKBCSQLFMNHD, Bacillus subtilis and Its Closest Relatives, Editor in Chief: A.L. Sonenshein, ASM Press, Washington D.C., 2002, Genbank Accession No. NC_000964), and the genes of the pur regulon from Escherichia coli (Escherichia and Salmonella, Second Edition, Editor in Chief: F.C. Neidhardt, ASM Press, Washington D.C., 1996). Accordingly, by enhancing expression of these genes, an ability to produce a purine-derived substance can be imparted or enhanced. In addition, genes of the purine operon which can be used for the present invention are not limited to these, and genes derived from other microorganisms, animals and plants may also be used. Examples of the method for increasing expression of the purine operon include increasing expression of genes of the purine operon in a Bacillus bacterium by a method of using a plasmid or integrating the genes into a chromosome or the like. The second method for increasing expression of the purine operon includes replacing a native promoter of the purine operon with a stronger promoter, and replacing the -35 or -10 region of the native promoter with a consensus sequence. For example, in Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis 168 Marburg strain, ATCC 6051), the -35 sequence of the purine operon is a consensus sequence (TTGACA), but the -10 sequence is TAAGAT, which differs from the consensus sequence TATAAT (Ebbole, D.J. and H. Zalikn, J. Biol. Chem., 1987, 262, 8274-8287). Therefore, by replacing the -10 sequence (TAAGAT) with a consensus sequence, by approximating the -10 sequence (TAAGAT) close to the consensus sequence, or changing it to TATAAT, TATGAT or TAAAAT, the transcriptional activity of the purine operon can be increased. A promoter sequence can be replaced by the same method as that of the gene substitution, which is described below. The third method for increasing expression of the purine operon includes decreasing expression of the purine operon repressor (U.S. Patent No. 6,284,495). The phrase "expression of a purine operon repressor" includes both transcription of a purine operon gene and translation of a transcription product. Furthermore, "decreasing expression" include decreasing the expression to be lower than that in an unmodified strain such as a wild-type Bacillus bacterium, and substantially eliminating the expression. Expression of the purine operon repressor (purine repressor) can be decreased by, for example, treating a Bacillus bacterium with ultraviolet ray irradiation or mutagen used in a usual mutagenesis treatment such as NTG or EMS and selecting a mutant showing decreased expression of the purine repressor can be employed. Furthermore, a Bacillus bacterium with decreased expression of the purine repressor can also be obtained by, for example, besides a mutagenesis treatment, replacing a gene encoding the purine repressor on a chromosome (purR, GenBank Accession NC_000964, coding region corresponds to the nucleotide numbers 54439 to 55293) with a corresponding gene that does not normally function (hereafter, also referred to as "disrupted-type gene") by homologous recombination utilizing a gene recombination technique (Experiments in Molecular Genetics, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1972); Matsuyama, S. and Mizushima, S., J. Bacteriol., 1985, 162, 1196-1202). Furthermore, an ability to produce a purine-derived substance can also be enhanced by attenuating uptake of purine-derived substances into cells. For example, the uptake of purine nucleosides by the cells can be attenuated by blocking a reaction involved in the uptake of purine nucleosides by the cells. Examples of the reaction involved in the uptake of purine nucleosides by the cells include reactions catalyzed by nucleoside permeases. Furthermore, when a purine nucleoside is produced, activity of an enzyme which decomposes the purine nucleoside may be decreased in order to enhance the ability to produce purine nucleoside. Examples of such an enzyme include purine nucleoside phosphorylase. Purine nucleotides biosynthesized from PRPP by enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis are dephosphorylated and thereby converted into a purine nucleoside. To efficiently cause accumulation of a purine nucleoside, it is preferable to reduce an activity of purine nucleoside phosphorylases, which further degrade purine nucleosides into hypoxanthine or the like. That is, it is preferable to attenuate or eliminate an activity of a purine nucleoside phosphorylase that employs purine nucleosides such as inosine, as a substrate. Specifically, the purine nucleoside phosphorylase activity can be decreased by disrupting the deoD and pupG genes encoding purine nucleoside phosphorylase in Bacillus bacteria. The Bacillus bacterium usable for the present invention may be modified by disrupting one or both of the deoD and pupG genes. As the deoD and pupG genes, for example, those genes derived from Bacillus bacteria (deoD; Genbank Accession No. NC_000964, coding region: 2134672-2135370), pupG; Genbank Accession No. NC_000964, coding region: 2445610-2446422) can be used. The ability to produce a purine-derived substance may also enhanced by decreasing the activity of succinyl-AMP synthase. Examples of the gene encoding succinyl-AMP synthase include the purA gene. Examples of the purA gene include, for example, those having the nucleotide sequence registered as GenBank Accession No. NC_000964 (coding region corresponds to the nucleotide numbers 4153460 to 4155749 of the complementary strand). The ability to produce a purine-derived substance may also be enhanced by decreasing an activity of inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase. Examples of the gene encoding IMP dehydrogenase include the guaB gene. Examples of the guaB gene include, for example, those having the nucleotide sequence registered as GenBank Accession No. NC_000964 (coding region corresponds to the nucleotide numbers 15913 to 17376). Moreover, as a method for enhancing an ability to produce purine-derived substance, amplification of a gene encoding a protein having an activity of excreting a purine-derived substance may be contemplated. An example of a bacterium in which such a gene has been amplified is a Bacillus bacterium in which the rhtA gene is amplified (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2003-219876). When the aforementioned L-amino acid-producing bacteria are bred by gene recombination, the genes to be used are not limited to genes having the genetic information mentioned above or genes having known sequences, but also include genes having conservative mutations, such as homologues or artificially modified genes, can also be used so long as the functions of the encoded proteins are not degraded. That is, they may be genes encoding a known amino acid sequence containing one or more substitutions, deletions, insertions, additions or the like of one or several amino acid residues at one or several positions. Although the number of the "one or several" amino acid residues referred to herein may differ depending on the position in the three-dimensional structure or the types of amino acid residues of the protein, specifically, it may be preferably 1 to 20, more preferably 1 to 10, still more preferably 1 to 5. The conservative mutation is a mutation wherein substitution takes place mutually among Phe, Trp, and Tyr, if the substitution site is an aromatic amino acid; among Leu, Ile and Val, if it is a hydrophobic amino acid; between Gln and Asn, if it is a polar amino acid; among Lys, Arg and His, if it is a basic amino acid; between Asp and Glu, if it is an acidic amino acid; and between Ser and Thr, if it is an amino acid having a hydroxyl group. Typical examples of a conservative mutation are conservative substitutions, and substitutions considered conservative substitutions include, specifically, substitution of Ser or Thr for Ala, substitution of Gln, His or Lys for Arg, substitution of Glu, Gln, Lys, His or Asp for Asn, substitution of Asn, Glu or Gln for Asp, substitution of Ser or Ala for Cys, substitution of Asn, Glu, Lys, His, Asp or Arg for Gln, substitution of Gly, Asn, Gln, Lys or Asp for Glu, substitution of Pro for Gly, substitution of Asn, Lys, Gln, Arg or Tyr for His, substitution of Leu, Met, Val or Phe for Ile, substitution of Ile, Met, Val or Phe for Leu, substitution of Asn, Glu, Gln, His or Arg for Lys, substitution of Ile, Leu, Val or Phe for Met, substitution of Trp, Tyr, Met, Ile or Leu for Phe, substitution of Thr or Ala for Ser, substitution of Ser or Ala for Thr, substitution of Phe or Tyr for Trp, substitution of His, Phe or Trp for Tyr, and substitution of Met, Ile or Leu for Val. The aforementioned amino acid substitutions, deletions, insertions, additions, inversions or the like may be a result of a naturally-occurring mutation or a variation due to an individual difference or difference of species of a microorganism from which the genes are derived. Such genes can be obtained by, for example, modifying a known nucleotide sequence of a gene by site-specific mutagenesis so that the amino acid residues at the specific sites of the encoded protein include substitutions, deletions, insertions, or additions of amino acid residues. Furthermore, such genes having a conservative mutations as mentioned above may encode a protein having a homology of 80% or more, preferably 90% or more, more preferably 95% or more, particularly preferably 97% or more, to the entire encoded amino acid sequence and having a function equivalent to that of the wild-type protein. Moreover, codons in the gene sequences may be replaced with other codons which are easily used in the host into which the genes are introduced. The genes having conservative mutation(s) may be obtained by methods usually used in mutagenesis treatments such as treatments with mutagenesis agents. Furthermore, the genes may be a DNA which can hybridize with a complementary sequence of a known gene sequence or a probe which can be prepared from the complementary sequence under stringent conditions and encodes a protein having a function equivalent to that of the known gene product. The "stringent conditions" referred to here are conditions under which a so-called specific hybrid is formed, and a non-specific hybrid is not formed. Examples of the stringent conditions include those under which highly homologous DNAs hybridize to each other, for example, DNAs not less than 80% homologous, preferably not less than 90% homologous, more preferably not less than 95% homologous, particularly preferably not less than 97% homologous, hybridize to each other, and DNAs less homologous than the above do not hybridize to each other, or conditions of washing once, preferably 2 or 3 times, at a salt concentration and temperature corresponding to washing of typical Southern hybridization, i.e., 1 x SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60°C, preferably 0.1 x SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60°C, more preferably 0.1 x SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68°C. As the probe, a part of the sequence which is complementary to the gene can also be used. Such a probe can be prepared by PCR using oligonucleotides prepared on the basis of a known gene sequence as primers and a DNA fragment containing the nucleotide sequence as a template. For example, when a DNA fragment having a length of about 300 bp is used as the probe, the washing conditions of hybridization may be 50°C, 2 x SSC and 0.1% SDS. Examples Hereinafter, the present invention will be specifically explained with reference to examples. However, the present invention is not limited to the following examples. Example 1: Production of L-tryptophan As an L-tryptophan-producing bacterium, E. coli No. 202 (refer to WO2005/103275) was used. This strain is a strain obtained by inserting the phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase gene (serA, derived from the plasmid pGH5, refer to WO94/08031) and the trp operon (derived from the plasmid pGX100) containing a desensitized type trpE gene (derived from E. coli MTR#2 strain, refer to U.S. Patent No. 4,371,614) into the chromosome of an L-tryptophan-producing bacterium, the SV164 strain (refer to WO94/08031). A glycerol stock of E. coli No. 202 was inoculated onto LB-agarose plate medium (1% of tryptone, 0.5% of yeast extract, 0.5% of sodium chloride and 1.5% of agarose) in an amount corresponding to one loop, and stationary culture was performed at 30°C for 24 hours. 10 µl of the aforementioned culture medium was inoculated into 50 ml of LB medium (1% of tryptone, 0.5% of yeast extract and 0.5% of sodium chloride) contained in a 500-ml Sakaguchi flask, and pre-culture was performed at 30°C for 8 hours with shaking (114 rpm). 0.9 ml of the aforementioned pre-culture medium was inoculated into 300 ml of a seed culture medium having the following composition. Culture was performed at 30°C for about 14 hours using a small fermentation tank having a total volume of 1 L with a power density of a stirring impeller of 4.4 kW/m3 and aeration of compressed air sterilized with a sterilization filter at 1 vvm. During the culture, temperature was maintained at 30°C, and pH was maintained at 6.5 with ammonia gas.

The main culture was performed at 31°C using a small fermentation tank having a total volume of 1 L with stirring at 4.4 kW/m3 and aeration of compressed air sterilized with a sterilization filter at 1 vvm. During the culture, temperature was maintained at 31°C, and pH was maintained at 6.7 with ammonia gas. During the culture, a 700 g/L glucose solution was appropriately fed to adjust the saccharide concentration in the small fermentation tank to be 5 to 20 g/L. After 23 hours of the culture, 10 g of L-tryptophan crystals (33 g/L) were added, and the culture was performed under four kinds of conditions of the power density of the stirring impeller, 2.4 kW/m3, 5.5 kW/m3, 15.5 kW/m3 and 19.9 kW/m3.

The results are shown in Fig. 2. Although the culture was not performed at a power density of 0, the plotting was performed also for power density of 0 in Fig. 2 in order to create an approximated curve. The production rate was represented with relative values based on the production rate obtained with a stirring power density of 15.5 kW/m3, which was taken as 1. Reference Example 1: Construction of L-glutamic acid-producing bacterium The primer 1 (SEQ ID NO: 1) and the primer 2 (SEQ ID NO: 2) for amplifying a part of the plasmid RSFCPG (European Patent Laid-open No. 1233068) which contains the gltA, ppc and gdhA genes derived from Escherichia coli were designed to amplify the part other than the gltA ORF. Using these primers and RSFCPG as a template, PCR was performed to obtain a fragment of about 14.9 kb. PCR was also performed using the primer 3 (SEQ ID NO: 3), the primer 4 (SEQ ID NO: 4) and the chromosomal DNA of the E. coli W3110 strain as a template to obtain a fragment of about 1.2 kb containing the methylcitrate synthase gene (prpC). Both the PCR products were treated with BglII and KpnI, ligated, and then used to transform the E. coli JM109 strain. All the appeared colonies were collected, and plasmids were extracted from the cells as a mixture. The E. coli ME8330 strain as a citrate synthase (CS) deficient strain was transformed with the plasmid mixture, and the cell suspension was applied onto the M9 minimal medium (medium containing 5 g of glucose, 2 mM magnesium sulfate, 3 g of monopotassium phosphate, 0.5 g of sodium chloride, 1 g of ammonium chloride and 6 g of disodium phosphate in 1 L of pure water) containing 50 mg/L of uracil and 5 mg/L of thiamine HCl. From the emerged strains, a plasmid was extracted and designated RSFPPG. This L-glutamic acid production plasmid RSFPPG was introduced into the Pantoea ananatis SC17sucA strain to construct an L-glutamic acid-producing strain, SC17sucA/RSFPPG (this strain is referred to as "NA1 strain"). The aforementioned SC17sucA strain is a strain obtained by obtaining a low phlegm production mutant strain (SC17) from the AJ13355 strain, which was isolated from the nature as a strain that could proliferate in a medium containing L-glutamic acid and a carbon source at low pH, and disrupting the sucA gene of the mutant strain (U.S. Patent No. 6,596,517).
