Mechanisms of agonist-induced down-regulation of the human kappa-opioid receptor: internalization is required for down-regulation.
Previously, we showed that the human kappa-opioid receptor (hkor) stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells underwent down-regulation after prolonged U50,488H treatment.
In the present study, we determined the mechanisms underlying this process.
U50, 488H caused a significant down-regulation of the hkor, although etorphine did not.
Neither U50,488H nor etorphine caused down-regulation of the rat kappa-opioid receptor.
Thus, similar to internalization, there are agonist and species differences in down-regulation of kappa-opioid receptors.
Expression of the dominant negative mutants arrestin-2(319-418) or dynamin I-K44A significantly reduced U50,488H-induced down-regulation of the hkor.
Coexpression of GRK2 or GRK2 and arrestin-2 permitted etorphine to induce down-regulation of the hkor, although expression of arrestin-2 or dynamin I alone did not.
Expression of the dominant negative mutants rab5A-N133I or rab7-N125I blunted U50,488H-induced down-regulation.
Pretreatment with lysosomal enzyme inhibitors [(2S, 3S)trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-3-methylbutane ethyl ester or chloroquine] or proteasome inhibitors (proteasome inhibitor I, MG-132, or lactacystin) decreased the extent of U50,488H-induced down-regulation.
A combination of chloroquine and proteasome inhibitor I abolished U50,488H-induced down-regulation.
These results indicate that U50,488H-induced down-regulation of the hkor involves GRK-, arrestin-2-, dynamin-, rab5-, and rab7-dependent mechanisms and receptors seem to be trafficked to lysosomes and proteasomes for degradation.
Thus, U50,488H-induced internalization and down-regulation of the hkor share initial common mechanisms.
To the best of our knowledge, these results represent the first report on the involvement of both rab5 and rab7 in agonist-induced down-regulation of a G protein-coupled receptor.
In addition, this study is among the first to show the involvement of proteasomes in agonist-induced down-regulation of a G protein-coupled receptor.
