Fisetin averts oxidative stress in pancreatic tissues of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.
Persistent hyperglycemia is associated with chronic oxidative stress which contributes to the development and progression of diabetes-associated complications.
The sensitivity of pancreatic β-cells to oxidative stress has been attributed to their low content of antioxidants compared with other tissues.
Bioactive compounds with potent antidiabetic properties have been shown to ameliorate hyperglycemia mediated oxidative stress.
Recently, we have reported that oral administration of fisetin (10 mg/Kg b.w.), a bioflavonoid found to be present in strawberries, persimmon, to STZ-induced experimental diabetic rats significantly improved normoglycemia.
The present study was aimed to evaluate the antioxidant potential of fisetin in both in vitro and in vivo.
Diabetes was induced by single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg body weight).
Fisetin was administered orally for 30 days.
At the end of the study, all animals were killed.
Blood samples were collected for the biochemical estimations.
The antioxidant status was evaluated.
Histological examinations were performed on pancreatic tissues.
Fisetin treatment showed a significant decline in the levels of blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), NF-kB p65 unit (in pancreas) and IL-1β (plasma), serum nitric oxide (NO) with an elevation in plasma insulin.
The treatment also improved the antioxidant status in pancreas as well as plasma of diabetic rats indicating the antioxidant potential of fisetin.
In addition, the results of DPPH and ABTS assays substantiate the free radical scavenging activity of fisetin.
Histological studies of the pancreas also evidenced the tissue protective nature of fisetin.
It is concluded that, fisetin possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory property and may be considered as an adjunct for the treatment of diabetes.
