Scientific evidence for traditional claim of antiobesity activity of Tecomella undulata bark.
ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The bark of Tecomella undulata is traditionally claimed in the treatment of various disease ailments including obesity and cancer.
Till now there are no studies about anti obesity activity of Tecomella undulata bark.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was aimed to establish a scientific evidence for anti obesity efficiency of ethyl acetate extract of Tecomella undulata bark (EATUB).
Further to standardize the active fractions of EATUB using different biomarkers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated activity of EATUB fractions (F1-F7) using 3T3-L1 fibroblasts.
Further, F1-mediated effects were characterized by determining mRNA and protein levels of SIRT1, one of the key targets for the treatment of obesity, using semi quantitative RT-PCR (sqRT-PCR) and western blot analysis.
The consequences of modulation of SIRT1 on mRNA and protein levels of various adipogenesis mediators like PPARγ, C/EBPα, E2F1, leptin, adiponectin and LPL were also studied.
In-vivo studies were performed using High Fat Diet (HFD) obese mice.
RESULTS: Our data showed that compared to controls, preadipocytes and adipocytes incubated with F1 exhibited a significant decrease in adipogenesis and lipogenesis.
In addition, sqRT-PCR and western blot analysis showed significant increase in SIRT1 and adiponectin levels and decrease in PPARγ, C/EBPα, E2F1, leptin and LPL levels in preadipocytes and adipocytes.
In-vivo studies of F1 in HFD induced obese mice showed significant improvement in lipid profile and glucose levels.
The bioactive fraction (F1) was determined to possess 4.95% of ferulic acid.
CONCLUSION: Thus, our findings signified the beneficial effects of Tecomella undulata bark in pharmacologic interventions related to obesity and metabolic disorders.
Ferulic acid and rutin are being reported and quantified for the first time from the bark of Tecomella undulata.
