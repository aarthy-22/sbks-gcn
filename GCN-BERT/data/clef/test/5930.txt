COLLOIDS CONTAINING POLYARAMIDE CONTINUING APPLICATION DATA This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 61/984,751, filed April 26, 2014, which is incorporated by reference herein. BACKGROUND Films including conductive materials, including conductive micro- and nano- spheres, rods, flakes, wires, sheets, etc., can be used in variety of applications, for example anti-static coatings, sensors, touch screens, electromagnetic interference (EMI) or radio-frequency interference (RFI) shielding, and electrodes for optoelectronic devices. During manufacturing of such films, poor suspension stability of conductive materials causes the loss of conductive materials and nonuniform coatings and overall deterioration of the performance. Poor suspension stability during manufacturing of films containing wavelength-converting material and light diffusing material can cause agglomerations and results in inhomogeneous distribution of the particles within the films. These agglomerations can decrease quantum efficiency of optical conversion, irregularly affect angular diffusive characteristics, and create non- uniformities in light output including, for example, hot spots or mura. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present disclosure relates to colloids that include a dispersion medium including polyaramides and a dispersed phase including conductive materials, wavelength-converting materials, and/or light diffusing materials.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS The present disclosure relates to colloids including a dispersion medium including a polyaramide including wherein A is independently selected from SO3H or COOH, or a sulfonic or carboxy salt of an alkali metal, ammonium, quaternary ammonium, alkali earth metal, Al , La , Ce , Fe , Cr , Mn , Cu2+, Zn2+, Pb2+ or Sn2+; n is an integer between 2 and 10,000; p is an integer greater than or equal to 1; and q is an integer greater than or equal to 1; and a dispersed phase comprising a conductive material, a wavelength-converting material, and/or light diffusing materials. The claimed polyaramides can decrease agglomeration and sedimentation of the dispersed phase due to intrinsic balance of hydrophilic-hydrophobic interactions within the material for wide ranges of solids content. The claimed colloids can be used to form films, providing advantages over other films containing conductive materials, wavelength-converting materials, and/or light diffusing materials. For example, the claimed polyaramides may increase uniformity in suspended conductive materials during film formation. Such increased uniformity allows for the use of lower amounts of conductive materials while maintaining electric conductivity at the same level. The claimed polyaramides may also provide a mechanism for orientation of conductive materials within the colloid. The claimed polyaramides may provide enhanced temperature stability when compared to other polymers; they do not exhibit a glass transition and have high decomposition temperatures of up to 350°C, permitting an increased variety and number of processing steps for the films. The claimed polyaramides may decrease agglomeration of wavelength-converting materials during film formation, allowing the formation of films with more uniform distribution of the dispersed phase. Additionally the claimed polyaramides can also be optically anisotropic and being disordered provide the films with diffusive properties, these diffusive properties give the films light- mixing functionality and result in more uniform light output, allowing the prevention of hot spots and mura. The claimed polyaramides can also have refractive indices that may match the refractive indices of wavelength-converting materials including, for example, phosphors and quantum dots. These matching refractive indices allow for decreased reflectance and back scattering. Additionally, the index matching and decreased agglomeration permit higher quantum conversion efficiency and luminous flux in phosphor-containing, quantum dot-containing, or hybrid films. The claimed polyaramides may also provide a mechanism for orientation of anisometric wavelength-converting materials within a colloid. The claimed polyaramides provide enhanced temperature stability when compared to other polymers, which is beneficial in down-conversion optical processes where an excess of optical energy releases as heat. The claimed polyaramides may decrease agglomeration of light diffusing material during film formation, allowing the formation of films with more uniform distribution of the dispersed phase. The claimed polyaramides can have refractive indices that may contrast with the refractive indices of a light diffusing material, improving light diffusing capability. The claimed polyaramides can also be optically anisotropic and being disordered provide the films with additional soft diffusive properties, improving uniformity of light output and preventing hot spots and mura. The claimed polyaramides being optically anisotropic can form an optically anisotropic coating which, in many embodiments, has three different principal refractive indices. One of the refractive indices can match the refractive index of the dispersed phase, enabling polarization sensitive scattering functionality in the film. The claimed polyaramides may also provide a mechanism for orientation of anisometric diffusing particles within the colloid in order to change the aspect ratio of the scattering angular distribution. The claimed polyaramides may provide enhanced temperature stability when compared to other polymers because they do not exhibit a glass transition and have high decomposition temperatures of up to 350°C.

In some embodiments, the wavelength-converting material in the film can be substantially aligned or parallel extending along an alignment direction. For example, coating a colloid containing poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide) by any type of shear coating can align the polyaramide molecules in more or less the same direction over a macroscopic dimension and can further align the wavelength-converting material, for example, an anisometric material, in the dispersed phase.

The viscosity of the colloid may be adjusted to optimize formation of the colloid layer, depending on the coating methods and, if applicable, the shear rate during coating. In some embodiments, forming a film by coating the colloid may further include removing an aqueous solvent from the colloid layer. A solvent may be removed by the method of coating or by, for example, heating or spinning the film. In some embodiments, after the film is formed the film may be removed from the substrate to form, for example, a standalone film.

In many embodiments, a film is formed by coating the colloid that includes a light diffusing material onto a substrate. In some embodiments, the light diffusing material in the film can be substantially aligned or parallel extending along an alignment direction. For example, coating a colloid containing poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide) by any type of shear coating can align the polyaramide molecules in more or less the same direction over a macroscopic dimension and can further align the light diffusing material, for example, an anisometric material, in the dispersed phase. In some embodiments, the coating can be formed by shear coating the colloid onto a substrate to form a colloid layer. In some embodiments, the coating can be formed by spin- coating the colloid onto a substrate to form a colloid layer. In some embodiments, the coating can be formed, by spray coating the colloid onto a substrate to form a colloid layer. In some embodiments, the colloid can be printed or sprayed onto a substrate to form a colloid layer. In further embodiments, the colloid can placed in a mold. In some embodiments, the printing can be, for example, screen printing or flexographic printing. The viscosity of the colloid may be adjusted to optimize formation of the colloid layer, depending on the coating methods and, if applicable, the shear rate during coating. In some embodiments, forming a film by coating the colloid may further include removing an aqueous solvent from the colloid layer. A solvent may be removed by the method of coating or by, for example, heating or spinning the film. In some embodiments, after the film is formed the film may be removed from the substrate to form, for example, a standalone film. The present invention is illustrated by the following examples. It is to be understood that the particular examples, materials, amounts, and procedures are to be interpreted broadly in accordance with the scope and spirit of the invention as set forth herein. EXAMPLES All reagents, starting materials and solvents used in the following examples were purchased from commercial suppliers (such as Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo.) and were used without further purification unless otherwise indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, all percentages indicate weight percents. Example 1. In this Example, silver nanowires were suspended in poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide-isophthalamide) (Formula X) and were coated roll-to-roll on PET to form globally conductive films. Poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide-isophthalamide), sodium form, was prepared as described in Example 11. Silver nanowires were 20-25 nm in diameter and 19-20 um in length with polyvinylpyrrolidone surface modifier. PET (Melinex 453, Dupont Teijin Films) was used as a substrate and prepared in a two-step process. First, the PET was corona treated at a rate of 3 meters/min with an in-line treater (ISI CH- 2KT+TRC, Integrated Solutions Co., Huntington Beach, CA) at 2 A. Second, the PET was primed with Primer (A-131-X, Mica Corporation, Shelton, CT). The primer was prepared to 0.5% solids by weight in de-ionized (DI) water and filtered through a nylon 0.45 μιη filter. Primer was coated on the PET by slot die to a wet weight of 7 g/m2 and dried for the equivalent of 1 minute in a 80°C hot air oven. A solution of poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide-isophthalamide) (7% in water) was mixed with silver nanowires (1% in water) in 1 : 1 weight ratio on a bottle roller for 1 hour to form a suspension. The suspension was coated by microgravure (Mini-labo Coater, Yasui Seiki Co., Ltd., Tokyo) or slot die (Premier Fixed Slot Coating Die, Nordson Extrusion Dies Industries, LLC, Chippewa Falls, WI) on top of the primed PET to wet coat weights of 2.5-12.5 g/m2. The coated layer was dried for the equivalent of 1 minute in a 80°C hot air oven to remove water from the colloid. The dried coating was passivated with the use of 10%> strontium chloride water solution. Typical passivation process is as follows. Coated substrate was dipped into the passivation solution for 5 seconds so that the entire coated area was submerged. Then the sample was dipped into deionized water for 5 seconds. After that the sample was rinsed with a stream of deionized water then dried with compressed air with a flow rate of 30 m/s. Table 1 As shown in Table 1 , electrical properties such as resistance and optical properties such as transmittance and haze can be controlled through varying film thickness. The films may be used for applications that require globally conductive transparent films such as touch panel displays. Example 2. In this Example, silver nanowires were suspended in poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide-isophthalamide) (Formula X) and were coated using roll-to-roll slot die on PET to form locally conductive films. PET substrate and coating solution were prepared as described in Example 1. Coating was done by slot die to wet coat weights of 15-20 g/m2 and dried for the equivalent of 2 minutes in a 80°C hot air oven to remove water from the colloid. Films were passivated and then analyzed as described in Example 1. Table 2 As shown in Table 2, these films do not have global conductivity. The films do, however, have local conductivity and are effective for use as transparent EMI shields for applications in architectural coatings such as window films. For films in which global conductivity is not required, films with higher transmittance may be achieved by lowering the conductive nanowire loading below the percolation threshold. For silver nanowires, the percolation threshold is dependent on the aspect ratio. For example, silver nanowires having an aspect ratio of 100 have a percolation threshold of about 9.8% in poly(2,2'- disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide-isophthalamide); silver nanowires having an aspect ratio of 500 have a percolation threshold of about 2.63% in poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide-isophthalamide); silver nanowires having an aspect ratio of 1000 have a percolation threshold of about 0.46% in poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide- isophthalamide). For Examples 1 and 2, the percolation threshold is about 0.46%. Example 3. In this Example, silver nanowires were suspended in poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide-isophthalamide) (Formula X) and were coated using roll-to-roll slot die on PET to form films on a carrier substrate that can be released after processing to serve as a standalone conductive film. Poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide-isophthalamide), sodium form, was prepared as described in Example 11. Silver nanowires were 20-25 nm in diameter and 19-20 μιη in length with polyvinylpyrrolidone surface modifier. PET (Melinex 453, Dupont Teijin) was used as a carrier film. A suspension containing 10% poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4 '-benzidine terephthalamide-isophthalamide) and 10% silver nanowires was mixed on a bottle roller for 1 hour. Coating was done by slot die (Premier Fixed Slot Coating Die, Nordson Extrusion Dies Industries, LLC, Chippewa Falls, WI) on top of the PET carrier to wet coat weights of 100-800 g/m2. The coated layer was dried for the equivalent of 10 minutes in a 80°C hot air oven to remove water from the colloid and passivated with the use of 10% strontium chloride water solution as described in Example 1. Then, the coating was released from the PET carrier film resulting in a standalone diffusing film. The resulting film was 40 μτη thick, with 0% transmittance, 70% haze, and a sheet resistance value of 50 Ω/square. These parameters are tunable through conductive particle loading and film thickness. As shown in this Example, thicker films (for example, 10-100 μιτι thick) can be released from a substrate after processing to serve as a standalone conductive film. Example 4. In this Example, silver nanowires were suspended in poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide) (Formula I) and were coated using spin coating or using a bar applicator. Poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide) was prepared as described Example 12. Silver nanowires were 20-25 nm diameter and 19-20 μηι in length with polyvinylpyrrolidone surface modifier. For spin coating, glass substrate was prepared by first ultra-sonicating in acetone for 5 minutes then ultra-sonicating in isopropyl alcohol for 5 minutes. The cleaned glass was rinsed with deionized water and dried by blowing with nitrogen gas. The coating suspension was prepared by mixing a solution of poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide) (10% in water) with silver nanowires (1% in water) in a 1 :9 weight ratio in an ultra-sonicator for 10 minutes. Spin coating was performed on a spin coater (Model P6700, Specialty Coating System Inc., Indianapolis, IN) at 700 rpm for 30 seconds. For bar applicator coating, glass substrate was prepared by hand washing in an alkaline detergent. The cleaned glass was rinsed with deionized water and dried by blowing with compressed air. The coating suspension was prepared by mixing a solution of poly(2,2'-disulfo- 4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide) (13.6% in water) with silver nanowires (1% in water) in a 1 :2 weight ratio on vortexer for 5 minutes. The suspension was coated onto the glass substrate using a bar applicator (Model 5363, BYK-Gardner, Geretsried, Germany) set to a 50 μηι gap. The coatings were passivated with the use of 10% strontium chloride water solution as described in Example 1. Film thickness was measured with a profilometer (Dektak 3 ST, Veeco, Plainview, NY) and anisotropy was qualitatively assessed with microscopy (OMAX M837PL). Total transmittance was measured with a spectrophotometer (UV-2600, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and global film conductivity was verified with a DC voltmeter with probes ~lmm apart. Table 3 As shown in Table 3 and FIG. 1, shear coated poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide), a lyotropic liquid crystal solution of rod-like polymeric molecules, permits nano- dispersant two-dimensional structure and anisotropy to be controlled. Example 5. In this Example, phosphor was suspended in poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide-isophthalamide) (Formula X) and coated on cellulose triacetate film (TAC) by bar applicator. Poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide-isophthalamide), sodium form, was prepared as described in Example 11. Poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide- isophthalamide), sodium form, reflection spectra were collected at various incident angles using a spectrophotometer (UV-2600, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Then, refractive index was calculated using the Fresnel formulae. Yttrium aluminium garnet based yellow phosphor particles were used, with peak wavelength 558 nm, CIEx 0.444, CIEy 0.536, and median diameter of the cumulative volume distribution of 8.5 μιη. Saponified TAC was used as a substrate. A solution of poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide-isophthalamide) (7.6% in water) was mixed with water-soluble polyester (35% in water) in 5: 1 weight ratio on a bottle roller for 15 minutes. Phosphor particles were added to 6%, 1 1%, and 16%, based on total suspension weight. The suspensions were rolled on a bottle roller for 1 hour. Coating was done by bar applicator (Model ZUA 2000, Zehntner Testing Instruments, Sissach, Switzerland) with gap size adjusted 100-500 μηι. The coated layer was dried in a 70°C oven. The coated films were laminated to another piece of TAC with optically clear adhesive (3M™ Optically Clear Adhesive 8142KCL, St. Paul, MN). Color temperature was measured with an integrating sphere lumens measurement system (SM-2000, Optimum Optoeletronics Corp,, T aiwan) under 467 nm light excitation. As shown in FIG. 8, poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide-isophthalamide) has high refractive index that can closely match the refractive index of the suspended phosphor particles. As shown in FIG. 2, color temperature can be controlled by altering film thickness and phosphor loading. Example 6. In this Example, quantum dots were suspended in poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide-isophthalamide) (Formula X) and then coated on glass by bar applicator. Poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide-isophthalamide), sodium form, was prepared as described in Example 11. Green and red quantum dot materials had CdSe or CdSSe cores with a ZnS shell and a polymeric coating containing carboxylic acid reactive groups (Zeta potential -30 to -50 mV, emission wavelengths 580 nm and 645 nm). Glass substrate was prepared by hand washing in an alkaline detergent. The cleaned glass was rinsed with deionized water and dried by blowing with compressed air. The coating suspension was prepared by mixing a solution of poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4 '-benzidine terephthalamide- isophthalamide) (1% in water) with quantum dots (8 μΜ in water) in a 99: 1 weight ratio on vortexer for 5 minutes. Coatings were formed using a bar applicator (Model 5363, BYK-Gardner, Geretsried, Germany) set to varying gaps 12-150 μηι, and the wet coatings were dried in an 70°C oven for 10 minutes. The resulting dried films were 0.1-1.0 um thick. Example 7. In this Example, quantum dots were suspended in poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide-isophthalamide) (Formula X) and cast into the form of an optical element. Quantum dots had CdSSe core, ZnS shell, with polymeric coating containing carboxylic acid reactive groups (Zeta potential -30 to -50 mV, emission wavelength 645 nm). Poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide-isophthalamide), sodium form, was prepared as described in Example 11. A suspension of poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide-isophthalamide) and water-based quantum dots was mixed on a bottle roller for 1 hour. The suspension, which contained 7.0% poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide-isophthalamide) and 0.1% quantum dots by weight in de-ionized water, was cast into a lens-shaped mold. The mold was placed in a 50°C drying oven and until set and the resulting quantum dot suspended lens was removed from the mold. Example 8. In this Example, diffuser particles were suspended in a high refractive index polymeric solution spray and then coated on a substrate. Poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide) (Formula I) was prepared as described in Example 12. Glass (0.7 mm thick) prepared as described in Example 6 was used as a substrate. PMMA (1 mm thick) was also used as a substrate and prepared with plasma treatment (oxygen plasma with 800W power at 200mm/s speed) and primer coating, as described in Example 1. The coating suspension was prepared by mixing a solution of poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide) (7.4% in water) with fumed silica particles (specific surface area 380 m2/g and refractive index n=1.47) to 1% and 2% loadings. The suspensions were mixed on a bottle roller for 1 hour. Spray coating was performed using Spray Coating Equipment (RSM-500FR, Rasem Techno logoy Co., LTD., New Taipei City, Taiwan (R.O.C.)). Spray coating was done with varying parameters to create diffusing films with different thicknesses and optical properties. Spray pressure was varied from 20 to 60 psi, flow rate was varied from 1.1 to 2.7 g/min, and nozzle speed was varied from 65 to 500 mm/s. Similar results were obtained with glass and PMMA substrates. Table 4 As shown in Table 4 and FIG. 3, haze and transmittance values can be optimized by varying the diffusing particle loading in the suspension, the spray pressure, and the coated diffusing layer thickness. Example 9. In this Example, diffuser particles were suspended in a high refractive index polymeric solution and the polymeric solution was used to form a standalone film. Poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide-isophthalamide), sodium form, was prepared as described in Example 11. PET (Melinex 453, Dupont Teijin) was used as a carrier film. A suspension containing 13% poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4 '-benzidine terephthalamide-isophthalamide) (Formula X) and 1% PMMA beads (10 um) was mixed on a bottle roller for 1 hour. Coating was done by slot die (Premier Fixed Slot Coating Die, Nordson Extrusion Dies Industries, LLC, Chippewa Falls, WI) on top of the PET carrier to wet coat weights of 100-800 g/m2. The coated layer was dried in a hot air oven at 80°C for 10 minutes and passivated with the use of 10% strontium chloride water solution as described in Example 1. Then, the coating was released from the PET carrier film resulting in a standalone diffusing film. A standalone diffusing film of 100 μηι had haze 75% and transmittance 55%. Similarly as in Example 8, the haze and transmittance values can be tuned based on diffuser particle loading and film thickness. Example 10. In this Example, rheological properties of solutions of poly (2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide-isophthalamide) (Formula X) and poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide) (Formula I) at various % solids in water were studied with use of a rheometer (AR 2000, TA Instruments, New Castle, DE). Poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide-isophthalamide), sodium form, was prepared as described in Example 11. Poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide) (Formula I) was prepared as described in Example 12. As shown in FIG. 4, modifications to solutions of poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide-isophthalamide) in water can be used to control suspension stability since the viscosity is highly sensitive to polymer solids content, temperature, and shear rate. At the low shear rates that are experienced during storage conditions, for example 100 1/s and lower, viscosity is highly sensitive to solids content; thus, solids contents can be optimized to improve suspension stability. During formation of the colloid layer, different coating methods require different viscosities and apply different shear rates. For example, a slot die coating is optimal with suspension viscosity 1000 cP and lower, and applies shear rates to the coating suspension around 2000 1/s. As seen in FIG. 5, the suspension medium is shear thinning so suspensions are stable while stored, but suspensions may also be coated by slot die due to the shear thinning behavior. FIG. 6 shows the dependence of poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide) viscosity on solids content and temperature versus shear rate. FIG. 7 shows the change in viscosity of poly(2,2'-disulfo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide-isophthalamide) with the addition of additives to the suspending medium, such as polyester, as described in Example 5. Example 11. The example describes synthesis of 2,2'-disu!fo-4,4'-benzidine terephthalamide- isophthalamide copolymer sodium salt, 10.0 g (0.029 niol) of 4,4''-diaminobiphenyl~2,2'-disulfonic acid was mixed with 3.1 g (0.029 mol) of sodium carbonate and 160 ml of water and stirred until the solid completely dissolved. Then 50 ml of toluene was added. Upon stirring the obtained solution, a solution of 4.3 g (0.021 mol) of terephthaloyl chloride and 1.6 g (0.008 mol) of isophthaloyl chloride and 0.7 g (0.005 mol) of benzoyl chloride in 30 ml of toluene were added followed by addition of 3.4 g (0.033 moi) of sodium carbonate in 50 ml of water. The resulting mixture thickened in about 30 minutes, it was heated to boiling and toluene distilled out. The resulting water solution was ultrafiltered using a PES membrane with MW cut-off 5K Dalton. Yield of the copolymer was 200 g of 7% water solution. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis of the sample was performed with Hewlett Packard 1260 ehrornatograph with diode array detector (λ=230 nra), using Varian GPC software Cirrus 3.2 and TOSOH Bioscience TSKgel G5000 PWxLColumn and 0.2 M phosphate buffer (pS ! 7) as the mobile phase. Poly(para-styrenesulfonic acid) sodium salt was used as GPC standard.
