BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The invention relates to compositions comprising an angiostatic truncated tRNA synthetase polypeptide or a nucleic acid encoding such truncated tRNA synthetase polypeptide for use in a method of suppressing angiogenesis or tumor metastasis in a mammal. 2. Background of the Invention Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which catalyze the aminoacylation of tRNA molecules, are ancient proteins that are essential for decoding genetic information during the process of translation. In higher eukaryotes, nine aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases associate with at least three other polypeptides to form a supramolecular multienzyme complex (Mirande et al., 1985, Eur. J. Biochem. 147:281-89). Each of the eukaryotic tRNA synthetases consists of a core enzyme, which is closely related to the prokaryotic counterpart of the tRNA synthetase, and an additional domain that is appended to the amino-terminal or carboxyl-terminal end of the core enzyme (Mirande, 1991, Prog. NucleicAcidRes. Mol. Biol. 40:95-142). Humantymsyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS), for example, has a carboxyl-terminal domain that is not part of prokaryotic and lower eukaryotic TyrRS, molecules (Figure 1) (Rho et al., 1998, J. Biol. Chem. 273:11267-73). It has also been suggested that both the bovine and rabbit TyrRS molecules possess an extra domain (Kleeman et al., 1997, J. Biol. Chem. 272:14420-25). In most cases, the appended domains appear to contribute to the assembly of the multienzyme complex (Mirande, supra). However, the presence of an extra domain is not strictly correlated with the association of a synthetase into the multienzyme complex. Higher eukaryotic TyrRS, for example, is not a component of the multienzyme complex (Mirande et al., supra). The carboxyl-terminal domain of human TyrRS shares a 51 % sequence identity with the mature form of human endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide II (EMAP II) (Rho et al., supra). TyrRS is the only higher eukaryotic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase known to contain an EMAP II-like domain. The EMAP-like domain of TyrRS has been shown to be dispensable for aminoacylation in vitro and in yeast (Wakasugi et al., 1998, EMBO J. 17:297-305). EMAP II is a proinflammatory cytokine that was initially identified as a product of murine methylcholanthrene A-induced fibrosarcoma cells. Pro-EMAP II is cleaved and is secreted from apoptotic cells to produce a biologically active 22-kD mature cytokine (Kao, et al., 1994, J. Biol. Chem. 269:25106-19). The mature EMAP II can induce migration of mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) and polymorphonuclearleukocytes (PMNs); it also stimulates theproduction of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFα) and tissue factor by MPs and the release of myeloperoxidase from PMNs. The catalytic core domain of tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) is a close homolog of the catalytic domain of TyrRS (Brown et al., 1997, J. Mol. Evol. 45:9-12). As shown in Figure 2, mammalian TrpRS molecules have an amino-terminal appended domain. In normal human cells, two forms of TrpRS can be detected: a major form consisting of the full-length molecule and a minor truncated form ("mini TrpRS"). The minor form is generated by the deletion of the amino-terminal domain through alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA (Tolstrup et al., 1995, J. Biol. Chem. 270:397-403). The amino-terminus of mini TrpRS has been determined to be the met residue at position 48 of the full-length TrpRS molecule (id.). Alternatively, truncated TrpRS maybe generated by proteolysis (Lemaire et al., 1975, Eur. J. Biochem. 51:237-52). For example, bovine TrpRS is highly expressed in the pancreas and is secreted into the pancreatic juice (Kisselev, 1993, Biochimie 75:1027-39), thus resulting in the production of a truncated TrpRS molecule. These results suggest that truncated TrpRS has a function other than the aminoacylation of tRNA (Kisselev, supra). Angiogenesis, or the proliferation of new capillaries from pre-existing blood vessels, is a fundamental process necessary for embryonic development, subsequent growth, and tissue repair. Angiogenesis is a prerequisite for the development and differentiation of the vascular tree, as well as for a wide variety of fundamental physiological processes including embryogenesis, somatic growth, tissue and organ repair and regeneration, cyclical growth of the corpus luteum and endometrium, and development and differentiation of the nervous system. In the female reproductive system, angiogenesis occurs in the follicle during its development, in the corpus luteum following ovulation and in the placenta to establish and maintain pregnancy. Angiogenesis additionally occurs as part of the body's repair processes, e.g. in the healing of wounds and fractures. Angiogenesis is also a factor in tumor growth, since a tumor must continuously stimulate growth of new capillary blood vessels in order to grow. Angiogenesis is an essential part of the growth of human solid cancer, and abnormal angiogenesis is associated with other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and diabetic retinopathy (Folkman, J. and Klagsbrun, M., Science 235:442-447,(1987)). Several factors are involved in angiogenesis. Both acidic and basic fibroblast growth factor molecules are mitogens for endothelial cells and other cell types. Angiotropin and angiogenin can induce angiogenesis, although their functions are unclear (Folkman, J., 1993, Cancer Medicine pp. 153-170, Lea and Febiger Press). A highly selective mitogen for vascular endothelial cells is vascular endothelial growth factor or VEGF (Ferrara, N., et al., Endocr. Rev. 13:19-32, (1992)). SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In a first aspect, the present invention provides a composition comprising (i) an angiostatic tRNA synthetase polypeptide and (ii) a pharmaceutically suitable excipient for use in a method of suppressing angiogenesis or tumor metastasis in a mammal, wherein the angiostatic tRNA synthetase polypeptide is a truncated tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase polypeptide comprising a Rossmann fold nucleotide binding domain.

In one embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule is a recombinant construct, such as a vector.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In order to facilitate understanding of the following examples, certain frequently occurring methods and/or terms will be described. The term "tRNA synthetase polypeptides" means polypeptides that are shorter than the corresponding full length tRNA synthetase. As used herein the term "cell culture" encompasses both the culture medium and the cultured cells. As used herein the phrase "isolating a polypeptide from the cell culture" encompasses isolating a soluble or secreted polypeptide from the culture medium as well as isolating an integral membrane protein from the cultured cells. "Plasmids" are designated by a lower case p preceded and/or followed by capital letters and/or numbers. The starting plasmids herein are either commercially available, publicly available on an unrestricted basis, or can be constructed from available plasmids in accord with published procedures. In addition, equivalent plasmids to those described are known in the art and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan. "Digestion" of DNA refers to catalytic cleavage of the DNA with a restriction enzyme that acts only at certain sequences in the DNA. The various restriction enzymes used herein are commercially available and their reaction conditions, cofactors and other requirements were used as would be known to the ordinarily skilled artisan. For analytical purposes, typically 1 µg of plasmid or DNA fragment is used with about 2 units of enzyme in about 20 µl of buffer solution. For the purpose of isolating DNA fragments for plasmid construction, typically 5 to 50 µg of DNA are digested with 20 to 250 units of enzyme in a larger volume. Appropriate buffers and substrate amounts for particular restriction enzymes are specified by the manufacturer. Incubation times of about 1 hour at 37 degrees C. are ordinarily used, but may vary in accordance with the supplier's instructions. After digestion the reaction is electrophoresed directly on a poly-acrylamide gel to isolate the desired fragment. "Oligonucleotides" refers to either a single stranded polydeoxynucleotide or two complementary polydeoxynucleotide strands which may be chemically synthesized. Such synthetic oligonucleotides have no 5' phosphate and thus will not ligate to another oligonucleotide without adding a phosphate with an ATP in the presence of a kinase. A synthetic oligonucleotide will ligate to a fragment that has not been dephosphorylated. The polynucleotide may be in the form of RNA or in the form of DNA, which DNA includes cDNA, genomic DNA, and synthetic DNA. The DNA may be double-stranded or single-stranded, and if single stranded may be the coding strand or non-coding (anti-sense) strand. The coding sequence which encodes the mature polypeptide may be identical to the coding sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:4 or may be a different coding sequence which coding sequence, as a result of the redundancy or degeneracy of the genetic code, encodes the same, mature polypeptide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:5. Thus, the term "polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide" encompasses a polynucleotide which includes only coding sequence for the polypeptide as well as a polynucleotide which includes additional coding and/or non-coding sequence. Variants of the hereinabove described polynucleotides encode for fragments, analogs and derivatives of the polypeptide having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:5 or the polypeptide encoded by the cDNA of SEQ ID NO:4. The variant of the polynucleotide may be a naturally occurring allelic variant of the polynucleotide or a non-naturally occurring variant of the polynucleotide. Thus, included are polynucleotides encoding the same mature polypeptide as shown of SEQ ID NO:5 or the same mature polypeptide encoded by the cDNA of SEQ ID NO:4 as well as variants of such polynucleotides which variants encode for a fragment, derivative or analog of the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:5 or the polypeptide encoded by SEQ ID NO:4. Such nucleotide variants include deletion variants, substitution variants and addition or insertion variants. As hereinabove indicated, the polynucleotide may have a coding sequence which is a naturally occurring allelic variant of the coding sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:4. As known in the art, an allelic variant is an alternate form of a polynucleotide sequence which have a substitution, deletion or addition of one or more nucleotides, which does not substantially alter the function of the encoded polypeptide. Also included are polynucleotides, wherein the coding sequence for the mature polypeptide may be fused in the same reading frame to a polynucleotide which aids in expression and secretion of a polypeptide from a host cell, for example, a leader sequence which functions as a secretory sequence for controlling transport of a polypeptide from the cell. The polypeptide having a leader sequence is a preprotein and may have the leader sequence cleaved by the host cell to form the mature form of the polypeptide. The polynucleotides may also encode for a proprotein which is the mature protein plus additional 5' amino acid residues. A mature protein having a prosequence is a proprotein and is an inactive form of the protein. Once the prosequence is cleaved an active mature protein remains. Thus, for example, the polynucleotide may encode for a mature protein, or for a protein having a prosequence or for a protein having both a prosequence and presequence (leader sequence). The polynucleotides may also have the coding sequence fused in frame to a market sequence which allows for purification of the polypeptide. The marker sequence may be a hexa-histidine tag supplied by a pQE-9 vector to provide for purification of the mature polypeptide fused to the marker in the case of a bacterial host, or, for example, the marker sequence may be a hemagglutinin (HA) tag when a mammalian host, e.g. COS-7 cells, is used. The HA tag corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein (Wilson, I., et al., Cell, 37:767 (1984)). Polynucleotides may hybridize to the hereinabove-described sequences if there is at least 50% and preferably 70% identity between the sequences. Polynucleotides may hybridize under stringent conditions to the hereinabove-described polynucleotides. As herein used, the term "stringent conditions" means hybridization will occur only if there is at least 95% and preferably at least 97% identity between the sequences. The polynucleotides which hybridize to the hereinabove described polynucleotides in a preferred embodiment encode polypeptides which retain substantially the same biological function or activity as the mature polypeptide encoded by the cDNA of SEQ ID NO:4. The terms "fragment," "derivative" and "analog" when referring to the polypeptide or that encoded by the deposited cDNA, means a polypeptide which retains essentially the same biological function or activity as such polypeptide. Thus, an analog includes a proprotein which can be activated by cleavage of the proprotein portion to produce an active mature polypeptide. The polypeptide may be a recombinant polypeptide, a natural polypeptide or a synthetic polypeptide, preferably a recombinant polypeptide. The fragment, derivative or analog of the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:5 or that encoded by the polynucleotide of SEQ ID NO:4 may be (i) one in which one or more of the amino acid residues are substituted with a conserved or non-conserved amino acid residue (preferably a conserved amino acid residue) and such substituted amino acid residue may or may not be one encoded by the genetic code, or (ii) one in which one or more of the amino acid residues includes a substituent group, or (iii) one in which the mature polypeptide is fused with another compound, such as a compound to increase the half-life of the polypeptide (for example, polyethylene glycol), or (iv) one in which the additional amino acids are fused to the mature polypeptide, such as a leader or secretory sequence or a sequence which is employed for purification of the mature polypeptide or a proprotein sequence. Such fragments, derivatives and analogs are deemed to be within the scope of those skilled in the art from the teachings herein. The polypeptides and polynucleotides are preferably provided in an isolated form, and preferably are purified to homogeneity. The term "isolated" means that the material is removed from its original environment (e.g., the natural environment if it is naturally occurring). For example, a naturally-occurring polynucleotide or polypeptide present in a living animal is not isolated, but the same polynucleotide or DNA or polypeptide, separated from some or all of the coexisting materials in the natural system, is isolated. Such polynucleotide could be part of a vector and/or such polynucleotide or polypeptide could be part of a composition, and still be isolated in that such vector or composition is not part of its natural environment. Host cells are genetically engineered (transduced or transformed or transfected) with vectors which may be, for example, a cloning vector or an expression vector. The vector may be, for example, in the form of a plasmid, a viral particle, a phage, etc. The engineered host cells can be cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for activating promoters, selecting transformants or amplifying the tRNA synthetase polpeptide genes. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan. The polynucleotide may be employed for producing a polypeptide by recombinant techniques. Thus, for example, the polynucleotide sequence may be included in any one of a variety of expression vehicles, in particular vectors or plasmids for expressing a polypeptide. Such vectors include chromosomal, nonchromosomal and synthetic DNA sequences, e.g., derivatives of SV40; bacterial plasmids; phage DNA; yeast plasmids; vectors derived from combinations of plasmids and phage DNA, viral DNA such as vaccinia, adenovirus, fowl pox virus, and pseudorabies. A preferred vector is pET20b. However, any other plasmid or vector may be used as long as it is replicable and viable in the host. As hereinabove described, the appropriate DNA sequence may be inserted into the vector by a variety of procedures. In general, the DNA sequence is inserted into an appropriate restriction endonuclease sites by procedures known in the art. Such procedures and others are deemed to be within the scope of those skilled in the art. The DNA sequence in the expression vector is operatively linked to an appropriate expression control sequence(s) (promoter) to direct mRNA synthesis. As representative examples of such promoters, there may be mentioned: LTR or SV40 promoter, the E. coli. lac or trp, the phage lambda PL promoter and other promoters known to control expression of genes in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells or their viruses. The expression vector also contains a ribosome binding site for translation initiation and a transcription terminator. The vector may also include appropriate sequences for amplifying expression. In addition, the expression vectors preferably contain a gene to provide a phenotypic trait for selection of transformed host cells such as dihydrofolate reductase or neomycin resistance for eukaryotic cell culture, or such as tetracycline or ampicillin resistance in E. coli. The vector containing the appropriate DNA sequence as herein above described, as well as an appropriate promoter or control sequence, may be employed to transform an appropriate host to permit the host to express the protein. As representative examples of appropriate hosts, there may be mentioned: bacterial cells, such as E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Streptomyces; fungal cells, such as yeast; insect cells, such as Drosophila and Sf9; animal cells such as CHO, COS or Bowes melanoma; plant cells, etc. The selection of an appropriate host is deemed to be within the scope of those skilled in the art from the teachings herein. More particularly, also described are recombinant constructs comprising one or more of the sequences as broadly described above. The constructs comprise a vector, such as a plasmid or viral vector, into which a sequence of the invention has been inserted, in a forward or reverse orientation. In a preferred aspect of this embodiment, the construct further comprises regulatory sequences, including, for example, a promoter, operably linked to the sequence. Large numbers of suitable vectors and promoters are known to those of skill in the art, and are commercially available. The following vectors are provided by way of example. Bacterial: pQE70, pQE-9 (Qiagen), pBs, phagescript, PsiX174, pBluescript SK, pBsKS, pNH8a, pNH16a, pNH18a, pNH46a (Stratagene); pTrc99A, pKK223-3, pKK233-3, pDR540, PRIT5 (Pharmacia). Eukaryotic: pWLneo, pSV2cat, pOG44, pXT1, pSG (Stratagene) pSVK3, pBPV, pMSG, pSVL (Pharmacia) and pET20B. In one preferred embodiment, the vector is pET20B. However, any other plasmid or vector may be used as long as they are replicable and viable in the host. Promoter regions can be selected from any desired gene using CAT (chloramphenicol transferase) vectors or other vectors with selectable markers. Two appropriate vectors are pKK232-8 and pCM7. Particular named bacterial promoters include lacI, lacZ, T3, T7, gpt, lambda PR, PL and trp. Eukaryotic promoters include CMV immediate early, HSV thymidine kinase, early and late SV40, LTRs from retrovirus, and mouse metallothionein-I. Selection of the appropriate vector and promoter is well within the level of ordinary skill in the art. In a further embodiment, host cells are described containing the above-described construct. The host cell can be a higher eukaryotic cell, such as a mammalian cell, or a lower eukaryotic cell, such as a yeast cell, or the host cell can be a prokaryotic cell, such as a bacterial cell. Introduction of the construct into the host cell can be effected by calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE-Dextran mediated transfection, or electroporation (Davis, L., Dibner, M., Battey, I., Basic Methods in Molecular Biology, 1986). The constructs in host cells can be used in a conventional manner to produce the gene product encoded by the recombinant sequence. Alternatively, the polypeptides can be synthetically produced by conventional peptide synthesizers. Mature proteins can be expressed in mammalian cells, yeast, bacteria, or other cells under the control of appropriate promoters. Cell-free translation systems can also be employed to produce such proteins using RNAs derived from the DNA constructs described herein. Appropriate cloning and expression vectors for use with prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts are described by Sambrook. et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition, (Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989). Transcription of a DNA encoding the polypeptides by higher eukaryotes is increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Enhancers are cis-acting elements of DNA, usually about from 10 to 300 bp, that act on a promoter to increase its transcription. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp 100 to 270), a cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, a polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers. Generally, recombinant expression vectors will include origins of replication and selectable markers permitting transformation of the host cell, e.g., the ampicillin resistance gene of E. coli and S. cerevisiae TRP1 gene, and a promoter derived from a highly-expressed gene to direct transcription of a downstream structural sequence. Such promoters can be derived from operons encoding glycolytic enzymes such as 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), .alpha-factor, acid phosphatase, or heat shock proteins, among others. The heterologous structural sequence is assembled in appropriate phase with translation initiation and termination sequences, and preferably, a leader sequence capable of directing secretion of translated protein into the periplasmic space or extracellular medium. Optionally, the heterologous sequence can encode a fusion protein including an N-terminal identification peptide imparting desired characteristics, e.g., stabilization or simplified purification of expressed recombinant product. Following transformation of a suitable host strain and growth of the host strain to an appropriate cell density, the selected promoter is derepressed by appropriate means (e.g., temperature shift or chemical induction) and cells are cultured for an additional period. Cells are typically harvested by centrifugation, disrupted by physical or chemical means, and the resulting crude extract retained for further purification. Microbial cells employed in expression of proteins can be disrupted by any convenient method, including freeze-thaw cycling, sonication, mechanical disruption, or use of cell lysing agents. Various mammalian cell culture systems can also be employed to express recombinant protein. Examples of mammalian expression systems include the COS-7 lines of monkey kidney fibroblasts, described by Gluzman, Cell, 23:175 (1981), and other cell lines capable of expressing a compatible vector, for example, the C127, 3T3, CHO, HeLa and BHK cell lines. Mammalian expression vectors will comprise an origin of replication; a suitable promoter and enhancer, and also any necessary ribosome binding sites, polyadenylation site, splice donor and acceptor sites, transcriptional termination sequences, and 5' flanking nontranscribed sequences. DNA sequences derived from the SV40 viral genome, for example, SV40 origin, early promoter, enhancer, splice, and polyadenylation sites may be used to provide the required nontranscribed genetic elements. Polypeptides are recovered and purified from recombinant cell cultures by methods used heretofore, including ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation, acid extraction, anion or cation exchange chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, affinity chromatography, hydroxyapatite chromatography and lectin chromatography. It is preferred to have low concentrations (approximately 0.1-5 mM) of calcium ion present during purification (Price, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 244:917 (1969)). Protein refolding steps can be used, as necessary, in completing configuration of the mature protein. Finally, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) can be employed for final purification steps. The polypeptides may be a naturally purified product, or a product of chemical synthetic procedures, or produced by recombinant techniques from a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host (for example, by bacterial, yeast, higher plant, insect and mammalian cells in culture). Depending upon the host employed in a recombinant production procedure, the polypeptides may be glycosylated with mammalian or other eukaryotic carbohydrates or may be non-glycosylated. The polypeptides may be modified to improve stability and increase potency by means known in the art. For example, L-amino acids can be replaced by D-amino acids, the amino temimus can be acetylated, or the carboxyl terminus modified, e.g., ethylamine-capped (Dawson, D.W., et al., Mol. Pharmacol., 55: 332-338 (1999)). tRNA synthetase therapy can be used to admininster the angiostatic tRNA synthetase polypeptides or polynucleotides encoding angiostatic tRNA synthetase polypeptides directly to the lumen and wall of other hollow organs, such as the uterus. The polypeptide may also be employed in accordance with the present invention by expression of such polypeptide in vivo, which is often referred to as "gene therapy." Thus, for example, cells such as bone marrow cells may be engineered with a polynucleotide (DNA or RNA) encoding for the polypeptide ex vivo, the engineered cells are then provided to a patient to be treated with the polypeptide. Such methods are well-known in the art. For example, cells may be engineered by procedures known in the art by use of a retroviral particle containing RNA encoding for the polypeptide. Similarly, cells may be engineered in vivo for expression of the polypeptide in vivo, for example, by procedures known in the art. As known in the art, a producer cell for producing a retroviral particle containing RNA encoding the polypeptide may be administered to a patient for engineering cells in vivo and expression of the polypeptide in vivo. These and other methods for administering a polypeptide by such methods should be apparent to those skilled in the art from the teachings of the present invention. For example, the expression vehicle for engineering cells may be other than a retroviral particle, for example, an adenovirus, which may be used to engineering cells in vivo after combination with a suitable delivery vehicle. Various viral vectors that can be utilized for gene therapy as taught herein include adenovirus, herpes virus, vaccinia, adeno-associated virus (AAV), or, preferably, an RNA virus such as a retrovirus. Preferably, the retroviral vector is a derivative of a murine or avian retrovirus, or is a lentiviral vector. The preferred retroviral vector is a lentiviral vector. Examples of retroviral vectors in which a single foreign gene can be inserted include, but are not limited to: Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV), Harvey murine sarcoma virus (HaMuSV), murine mammary tumor virus (MuMTV), SIV, BIV, HIV and Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV). A number of additional retroviral vectors can incorporate multiple genes. All of these vectors can transfer or incorporate a gene for a selectable marker so that transduced cells can be identified and generated. By inserting a zinc finger derived-DNA binding polypeptide sequence of interest into the viral vector, along with another gene that encodes the ligand for a receptor on a specific target cell, for example, the vector is made target specific. Retroviral vectors can be made target specific by inserting, for example, a polynucleotide encoding a protein. Preferred targeting is accomplished by using an antibody to target the retroviral vector. Those of skill in the art will know of, or can readily ascertain without undue experimentation, specific polynucleotide sequences which can be inserted into the retroviral genome to allow target specific delivery of the retroviral vector containing the zinc finger-nucleotide binding protein polynucleotide. Since recombinant retroviruses are defective, they require assistance in order to produce infectious vector particles. This assistance can be provided, for example, by using helper cell lines that contain plasmids encoding all of the structural genes of the retrovirus under the control of regulatory sequences within the LTR. These plasmids are missing a nucleotide sequence which enables the packaging mechanism to recognize an RNA transcript for encapsitation. Helper cell lines which have deletions of the packaging signal include but are not limited to Ψ2, PA317 and PA12, for example. These cell lines produce empty virions, since no genome is packaged. If a retroviral vector is introduced into such cells in which the packaging signal is intact, but the structural genes are replaced by other genes of interest, the vector can be packaged and vector virion produced. The vector virions produced by this method can then be used to infect a tissue cell line, such as NIH 3T3 cells, to produce large quantities of chimeric retroviral virions. Another targeted delivery system for polynucleotides encoding zinc finger derived-DNA binding polypeptides is a colloidal dispersion system Colloidal dispersion systems include macromolecule complexes, nanocapsules, microspheres, beads, and lipid-based systems including oil-in-water emulsions, micelles, mixed micelles, and liposomes. The preferred colloidal system of this invention is a liposome. Liposomes are artificial membrane vesicles which are useful as delivery vehicles in vitro and in vivo. It has been shown that large unilamellar vesicles (LUV), which range in size from 0.2-4.0 µm can encapsulate a substantial percentage of an aqueous buffer containing large macromolecules. RNA, DNA and intact virions can be encapsulated within the aqueous interior and be delivered to cells in a biologically active form (Fraley, et al., Trends Biochem. Sci., 6:77, 1981). In addition to mammalian cells, liposomes have been used for delivery of polynucleotides in plant, yeast and bacterial cells. In order for a liposome to be an efficient gene transfer vehicle, the following characteristics should be present: (1) encapsulation of the genes of interest at high efficiency while not compromising their biological activity; (2) preferential and substantial binding to a target cell in comparison to non-target cells; (3) delivery of the aqueous contents of the vesicle to the target cell cytoplasm at high efficiency; and (4) accurate and effective expression of genetic information (Mannino, et al., Biotechniques, 6:682, 1988). The composition of the liposome is usually a combination of phospholipids, particularly high-phase-transition-temperature phospholipids, usually in combination with steroids, especially cholesterol. Other phospholipids or other lipids may also be used. The physical characteristics of liposomes depend on pH, ionic strength, and the presence of divalent cations. Examples of lipids useful in liposome production include phosphatidyl compounds, such as phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingolipids, cerebrosides, and gangliosides. Particularly useful are diacylphosphatidylglycerols, where the lipid moiety contains from 14-18 carbon atoms, particularly from 16-18 carbon atoms, and is saturated. Illustrative phospholipids include egg phosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and distearoylphosphatidylcholine. The targeting of liposomes has been classified based on anatomical and mechanistic factors. Anatomical classification is based on the level of selectivity, for example, organ-specific, cell-specific, and organelle-specific. Mechanistic targeting can be distinguished based upon whether it is passive or active. Passive targeting utilizes the natural tendency of liposomes to distribute to cells of the reticulo-endothelial system (RES) in organs which contain sinusoidal capillaries. Active targeting, on the other hand, involves alteration of the liposome by coupling the liposome to a specific ligand such as a monoclonal antibody, sugar, glycolipid, or protein, or by changing the composition or size of the liposome in order to achieve targeting to organs and cell types other than the naturally occurring sites of localization. The surface of the targeted delivery system may be modified in a variety of ways. In the case of a liposomal targeted delivery system, lipid groups can be incorporated into the lipid bilayer of the liposome in order to maintain the targeting ligand in stable association with the liposomal bilayer. Various linking groups can be used for joining the lipid chains to the targeting ligand. In general, the compounds bound to the surface of the targeted delivery system will be ligands and receptors which will allow the targeted delivery system to find and "home in" on the desired cells. A ligand may be any compound of interest which will bind to another compound, such as a receptor. In general, surface membrane proteins which bind to specific effector molecules are referred to as receptors. Herein, antibodies are preferred receptors. Antibodies can be used to target liposomes to specific cell-surface ligands. For example, certain antigens expressed specifically on tumor cells, referred to as tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), may be exploited for the purpose of targeting antibody-zinc finger-nucleotide binding protein-containing liposomes directly to the malignant tumor. Since the zinc finger-nucleotide binding protein gene product may be indiscriminate with respect to cell type in its action, a targeted delivery system offers a significant improvement over randomly injecting non-specific liposomes. A number of procedures can be used to covalently attach either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies to a liposome bilayer. Antibody-targeted liposomes can include monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies or fragments thereof such as Fab, or F(ab')2, as long as they bind efficiently to an the antigenic epitope on the target cells. Liposomes may also be targeted to cells expressing receptors for hormones or other serum factors. There are available to one skilled in the art multiple viral and non-viral methods suitable for introduction of a nucleic acid molecule into a target cell. Genetic manipulation of primary tumor cells has been described previously (Patel et al., 1994). Genetic modification of a cell may be accomplished using one or more techniques well known in the gene therapy field (Human Gene Therapy, April 1994, Vol. 5, p. 543-563; Mulligan, R.C. 1993). Viral transduction methods may comprise the use of a recombinant DNA or an RNA virus comprising a nucleic acid sequence that drives or inhibits expression of a protein having sialyltransferase activity to infect a target cell. A suitable DNA virus for use in the present invention includes but is not limited to an adenovirus (Ad), adeno-associated virus (AAV), herpes virus, vaccinia virus or a polio virus. A suitable RNA virus for use in the present invention includes but is not limited to a retrovirus or Sindbis virus. It is to be understood by those skilled in the art that several such DNA and RNA viruses exist that may be suitable for use in the present invention. Adenoviral vectors have proven especially useful for gene transfer into eukaryotic cells (Stratford-Perricaudet and Perricaudet, 1991). Adenoviral vectors have been successfully utilized to study eukaryotic gene expression (Levrero, M., et al. 1991), vaccine development (Graham and Prevec, 1992), and in animal models (Stratford-Perricaudet, et al. 1992.; Rich, et al. 1993). The first trial of Ad-mediated gene therapy in human was the transfer of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene to lung (Crystal, et al., 1994). Experimental routes for administrating recombinant Ad to different tissues in vivo have included intratracheal instillation (Rosenfeld, et al. 1992) injection into muscle (Quantin, B., et al. 1992), peripheral intravenous injection (Herz and Gerard, 1993) and stereotactic inoculation to brain (Le Gal La Salle, et al. 1993). The adenoviral vector, then, is widely available to one skilled in the art and is suitable for use in the present invention. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has recently been introduced as a gene transfer system with potential applications in gene therapy. Wild-type AAV demonstrates high-level infectivity, broad host range and specificity in integrating into the host cell genome (Hermonat and Muzyczka, 1984). Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) is attractive as a vector system, especially for use in the nervous system because of its neurotropic property (Geller and Federoff, 1991; Glorioso, et al. 1995). Vaccinia virus, of the poxvirus family, has also been developed as an expression vector (Smith and Moss, 1983; Moss, 1992). Each of the above-described vectors are widely available to one skilled in the art and would be suitable for use in the present invention. Retroviral vectors are capable of infecting a large percentage of the target cells and integrating into the cell genome (Miller and Rosman, 1989). Retroviruses were developed as gene transfer vectors relatively earlier than other viruses, and were first used successfully for gene marking and transducing the cDNA of adenosine deaminase (ADA) into human lymphocytes. Preferred retroviruses include lentiviruses. In preferred embodiments, the retrovirus is selected from the group consisting of HIV, BIV and SIV. "Non-viral" delivery techniques that have been used or proposed for gene therapy include DNA-ligand complexes, adenovirus-ligand-DNA complexes, direct injection of DNA, CaPO4 precipitation, gene gun techniques, electroporation, liposomes and lipofection (Mulligan, 1993). Any of these methods are widely available to one skilled in the art and would be suitable for use in the present invention. Other suitable methods are available to one skilled in the art, and it is to be understood that the present invention may be accomplished using any of the available methods of transfection. Several such methodologies have been utilized by those skilled in the art with varying success (Mulligan, R., 1993). Lipofection may be accomplished by encapsulating an isolated DNA molecule within a liposomal particle and contacting the liposomal particle with the cell membrane of the target cell. Liposomes are self-assembling, colloidal particles in which a lipid bilayer, composed of amphiphilic molecules such as phosphatidyl serine or phosphatidyl choline, encapsulates a portion of the surrounding media such that the lipid bilayer surrounds a hydrophilic interior. Unilammellar or multilammellar liposomes can be constructed such that the interior contains a desired chemical, drug, or, as in the instant invention, an isolated DNA molecule. The cells may be transfected in vivo, ex vivo, or in vitro. The cells may be transfected as primary cells isolated from a patient or a cell line derived from primary cells, and are not necessarily autologous to the patient to whom the cells are ultimately administered. Following ex vivo or in vitro transfection, the cells may be implanted into a host. Genetic manipulation of primary tumor cells has been described previously (Patel, et al. 1994). Genetic modification of the cells may be accomplished using one or more techniques well known in the gene therapy field (Human Gene Therapy. April 1994. Vol. 5, p. 543-563; Mulligan, R.C. 1993). In order to obtain transcription of the nucleic acid within a target cell, a transcriptional regulatory region capable of driving gene expression in the target cell is utilized. The transcriptional regulatory region may comprise a promoter, enhancer, silencer or repressor element and is functionally associated with a nucleic acid of the present invention. Preferably, the transcriptional regulatory region drives high level gene expression in the target cell. Transcriptional regulatory regions suitable for use in the present invention include but are not limited to the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early enhancer/promoter, the SV40 early enhancer/promoter, the JC polyomavirus promoter, the albumin promoter, PGK and the α-actin promoter coupled to the CMV enhancer (Doll, et al. 1996). The vectors may be constructed using standard recombinant techniques widely available to one skilled in the art. Such techniques may be found in common molecular biology references such as Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (Sambrook, et al., 1989, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press), Gene Expression Technology (Methods in Enzymology, Vol. 185, edited by D. Goeddel, 1991. Academic Press, San Diego, CA), and PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications (Innis, et al. 1990. Academic Press, San Diego, CA). Administration of a nucleic acid to a target cell in vivo may be accomplished using any of a variety of techniques well known to those skilled in the art. The vectors may be administered orally, parentally, by inhalation spray, rectally, or topically in dosage unit formulations containing conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants, and vehicles. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal, infusion techniques or intraperitoneally. Suppositories for rectal administration of the drug can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient such as cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols that are solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum and release the drug. The dosage regimen for treating a disorder or a disease with the vectors and/or compositions is based on a variety of factors, including the type of disease, the age, weight, sex, medical condition of the patient, the severity of the condition, the route of administration, and the particular compound employed. Thus, the dosage regimen may vary widely, but can be determined routinely using standard methods. The pharmaceutically active compounds (i.e., vectors) can be processed in accordance with conventional methods of pharmacy to produce medicinal agents for administration to patients, including humans and other mammals. For oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition may be in the form of, for example, a capsule, a tablet, a suspension, or liquid. The pharmaceutical composition is preferably made in the form of a dosage unit containing a given amount of DNA or viral vector particles (collectively referred to as "vector"). For example, these may contain an amount of vector from about 103-1015 viral particles, preferably from about 106-1012 viral particles. A suitable daily dose for a human or other mammal may vary widely depending on the condition of the patient and other factors, but, once again, can be determined using routine methods. The vector may also be administered by injection as a composition with suitable carriers including saline, dextrose, or water. While the nucleic acids and /or vectors can be administered as the sole active pharmaceutical agent, they can also be used in combination with one or more vectors or other agents. When administered as a combination, the therapeutic agents can be formulated as separate compositions that are given at the same time or different times, or the therapeutic agents can be given as a single composition. The polypeptide may be employed in combination with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier. Such compositions comprise a therapeutically effective amount of the protein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Such a carrier includes but is not limited to saline, buffered saline, dextrose, water, glycerol, ethanol, and combinations thereof. The formulation should suit the mode of administration. Also described is a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Associated with such container(s) can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture, use or sale for human administration. In addition, the polypeptide may be employed in conjunction with other therapeutic compounds. The pharmaceutical compositions may be administered in a convenient manner, such as the transdermal, transmucosal, enteral and parentral intravenous routes. The amounts and dosage regimens of tRNA synthetase polypeptides administered to a subject will depend on a number of factors, such as the mode of administration, the nature of the condition being treated, the body weight of the subject being treated and the judgment of the prescribing physician. Generally speaking, it is given, for example, in therapeutically effective doses of at least about 10 µg/kg body weight and, in most cases, it would be administered in an amount not in excess of about 8 mg/kg body weight per day and preferably the dosage is from about 10 µg/kg body weight to about 1 mg/kg body weight daily, taking into the account the routes of administration, symptoms, etc. tRNA synthetase polypeptides can be inhibited in vivo by the use of antisense technology. Antisense technology can be used to control gene expression through triple-helix formation or antisense DNA or RNA, both of which methods are based on binding of a polynucleotide to DNA or RNA. For example, the 5' coding portion of the mature polynucleotide sequence, which encodes for the polypeptide, is used to design an antisense RNA oligonucleotide of from 10 to 40 base pairs in length. A DNA oligonucleotide is designed to be complementary to a region of the gene involved in transcription (triple helix--see Lee et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 6:3073 (1979); Cooney et al., Science, 241:456 (1988); and Dervan et al., Science, 251:1360 (1991)), thereby preventing transcription and the production of VEGF2. The antisense RNA oligonucleotide hybridizes to the mRNA in vivo and blocks translation of an mRNA molecule into the tRNA synthetase polypeptides (antisense-Okano, J. Neurochem., 56:560 (1991); Oligodeoxynucleotides as Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla. (1988)). Alternatively, the oligonucleotides described above can be delivered to cells by procedures in the art such that the anti-sense RNA or DNA may be expressed in vivo to inhibit production of tRNA synthetase polypeptides in the manner described above. Antisense constructs to tRNA synthetase polypeptides, therefore, may inhibit the activity of the tRNA synthetase polypeptides and prevent the further growth or even regress solid tumors, since angiogenesis and neovascularization are essential steps in solid tumor growth. These antisense constructs may also be used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and diabetic retinopathy which are all characterized by abnormal angiogenesis. Alternatively, angiostatic TrpRS therapy can be used to oppose the angiogenic activity of endogenous and exogenous angiogenic factors, including TyTRS polypeptides, and to prevent the further growth or even regress solid tumors, since angiogenesis and neovascularization are essential steps in solid tumor growth. Such therapies can also be used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and diabetic retinopathy which are all characterized by abnormal angiogenesis. The polypeptides, their fragments or other derivatives, or analogs thereof, or cells expressing them can be used as an immunogen to produce antibodies thereto. These antibodies can be, for example, polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies. The present invention also includes chimeric, single chain, and humanized antibodies, as well as Fab fragments, or the product of an Fab expression library. Various procedures known in the art may be used for the production of such antibodies and fragments. Antibodies generated against the polypeptide corresponding to a sequence of the present invention can be obtained by direct injection of the polypeptide into an animal or by administering the polypeptide to an animal, preferably a nonhuman. The antibody so obtained will then bind the polypeptide itself. In this manner, even a sequence encoding only a fragment of the polypeptide can be used to generate antibodies binding the whole native polypeptide. Such antibodies can then be used to isolate the polypeptide from tissue expressing that polypeptide. For preparation of monoclonal antibodies, any technique which provides antibodies produced by continuous cell line cultures can be used. Examples include the hybridoma technique (Kohler and Milstein, 1975, Nature, 256:495-497), the trioma technique, the human B-cell hybridoma technique (Kozbor et al., 1983, Immunology Today 4:72), and the EBV-hybridoma technique to produce human monoclonal antibodies (Cole, et al., 1985, in Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96). Techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778) can be adapted to produce single chain antibodies to immunogenic polypeptide products. Neutralization antibodies can be identified and applied to mask the activity of tRNA synthetase polypeptides. The utility of such an approach has been shown in mice model systems against VEGF. VEGP2 can also be inactivated by certain dominant negative mutants within the gene itself. It is known that both PDGF-α and -β form either heterodimers or homodimers, and VEGF forms homodimers. These antibodies therefore may be used to block endogenous angiogenic activity and retard the growth of solid tumors. These antibodies may also be used to treat inflammation caused by the increased vascular permeability. These antibodies may further be used in an immunoassay to detect the presence of tumors in certain individuals. Enzyme immunoassay can be performed from the blood sample of an individual. Antagonists/inhibitors of the polypeptides are those which inhibit or eliminate the function of the polypeptide. Thus, for example, antagonists bind to a polypeptide and inhibit or eliminate its function. The antagonist, for example, could be an antibody against the polypeptide which binds to the polypeptide or, in some cases, an oligonucleotide. An example of an inhibitor is a small molecule which binds to and occupies the catalytic site of the polypeptide thereby making the catalytic site inaccessible to substrate such that normal biological activity is prevented. Examples of small molecules include but are not limited to small peptides or peptide-like molecules. Alternatively, antagonists to the polypeptides may be employed which bind to the receptors to which a polypeptide normally binds. The antagonists may be closely related proteins such that they recognize and bind to the receptor sites of the natural protein, however, they are inactive forms of the natural protein and thereby prevent the action of the normal polypeptide ligand. The antagonist/inhibitors may be used therapeutically as an anti-tumor drug by occupying the receptor sites of tumors. The antagonist/inhibitors may also be used to prevent inflammation. The antagonist/inhibitors may also be used to treat solid tumor growth, diabetic retinopathy, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. The antagonist/inhibitors may be employed in a composition with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, e.g., as hereinabove described. These and other aspects of the present invention should be apparent to those skilled in the art from the teachings herein. The word "complex" as used herein refers to the product of a specific binding reaction such as an antibody-antigen or receptor-ligand reaction. Exemplary complexes are immunoreaction products. As used herein, the terms "label" and "indicating means" in their various grammatical forms refer to single atoms and molecules that are either directly or indirectly involved in the production of a detectable signal to indicate the presence of a complex. Any label or indicating means can be linked to or incorporated in an expressed protein, polypeptide, or antibody molecule that is part of an antibody or monoclonal antibody composition or used separately, and those atoms or molecules can be used alone or in conjunction with additional reagents. Such labels are themselves well-known in clinical diagnostic chemistry and constitute a part of this invention only insofar as they are utilized with otherwise novel proteins methods and/or systems. The labeling means can be a fluorescent labeling agent that chemically binds to antibodies or antigens without denaturing them to form a fluorochrome (dye) that is a useful immunofluorescent tracer. Suitable fluorescent labeling agents are fluorochromes such as fluorescein isocyanate (FIC), fluorescein isothiocyante (FTTC), 5-dimethylamine-1-naphthalenesulfonyl chloride (DANSC), tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC), lissamine, rhodamine 8200 sulphonyl chloride (RB 200 SC) and the like. A description of immunofluorescence analysis techniques is found in DeLuca, "Immunofluorescence Analysis", in Antibody As a Tool, Marchalonis et al., Eds., John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., pp. 189-231 (1982). Other suitable labeling agents are known to those skilled in the art. In preferred embodiments, the indicating group is an enzyme, such as horseradish peroxidase (HRP), glucose oxidase, or the like. In such cases where the principal indicating group is an enzyme such as HRP or glucose oxidase, additional reagents are required to visualize the fact that a receptor-ligand complex (immunoreactant) has formed. Such additional reagents for HRP include hydrogen peroxide and an oxidation dye precursor such as diaminobenzidine. An additional reagent useful with glucose oxidase is 2,2'-amino-di-(3-ethyl-benzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS). Radioactive elements are also useful labeling agents and are used illustratively herein. An exemplary radiolabeling agent is a radioactive element that produces gamma ray emissions. Elements which themselves emit gamma rays, such as 124I, 125I, 128I, 132I and 51Cr represent one class of gamma ray emission-producing radioactive element indicating groups. Particularly preferred is 125I. Another group of useful labeling means are those elements such as "C, 18F, 15O and 13N which themselves emit positrons. The positrons so emitted produce gamma rays upon encounters with electrons present in the animal's body. Also useful is a beta emitter, such 111 indium or 3H. The linking of labels or labeling of polypeptides and proteins is well known in the art. For instance, antibody molecules produced by a hybridoma can be labeled by metabolic incorporation of radioisotope-containing amino acids provided as a component in the culture medium (see, e.g., Galfre et al., Meth. Enzymol., 73:3-46 (1981)). The techniques of protein conjugation or coupling through activated functional groups are particularly applicable (see, for example, Aurameas, et al.., Scand. J. Immunol., Vol. 8 Suppl. 7:7-23 (1978); Rodwell et al., Biotech., 3:889-894 (1984); and U.S. Pat. No. 4,493,795). The Examples, which follow, are illustrative of specific embodiments of the invention, and various uses thereof. They are set forth for explanatory purposes only, and are not to be taken as limiting the invention. Those examples which are not encompassed by the claims are given for comparative purposes only. EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of Endotoxin-Free Recombinant TyrRS and TrpRS Endotoxin-free recombinant human TyrRS and human TrpRS was prepared as follows. Plasmids encoding full-length TyrRS (528 amino acid residues; Figures 1 and 2), truncated TyrRS (mini TyrRS, residues 1-364 of full-length TyrRS; carboxyl-domain of TyrRS, residues 359-528 of full-length TyrRS), full-length TrpRS (471 amino acid residues), or truncated TrpRS (mini TrpRS, residues 48-471 of full-length TrpRS; supermini TrpRS, residues 71-471 of full-length TrpRS), each also encoding a C-terminal tag of six histidine residues, were introduced into E. coli strain BL 21 (DE 3) (Novagen, Madison, WI). Overexpression of recombinant TyrRS or TrpRS was induced by treating the cells with isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 hours. Cells were then lysed and the proteins from the supernatant purified on His•Bind® nickel affinity columns (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. Following purification, TrpRS proteins were incubated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 µMZnSO4 and then free Zn2+ was removed (Kisselev et al., 1981, Eur. J. Biochem. 120:511-17). Endotoxin was removed from protein samples by phase separation using Triton X-114 (Liu et al., 1997, Clin. Biochem. 30:455-63). Protein samples were determined to contain less than 0.01 units of endotoxin per mL using an E-Toxate® gel-clot assay (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. EXAMPLE 2 Angiostatic Effect of Human TrpRS on Cell Proliferation Expression of mini TrpRS in human cells is highly stimulated by the addition of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (Shaw et al., 1999, Electrophoresis 20:984-93). Expression of the α-chemokines IP-10 (interferon-γ inducible protein) and MIG (monokine induced by interferon-γ) has also been shown to be enhanced by IFN-γ (Kaplan et al., 1987, J. Exp. Med. 166:1098-108; Farber, 1993, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 192:223-30). These α-chemokines lack the ELR motif and function as angiostatic factors both in vitro and in vivo (Strieter et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270:27348-57). The presence in mammalian TrpRS molecules of a Rossmann nucleotide binding fold and DLT sequence, in place of the ELR motif, suggests that mammalian TrpRS molecules may function as angiostatic factors. The angiostatic activity of TrpRS was first evaluated in experiments testing the ability of human full-length TrpRS and human mini TrpRS to inhibit human VEGF165-induced cell proliferation. Tissue culture-treated 96-well plates (Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) were coated with 0.1% gelatin (Sigma) overnight. Cells were then seeded in the gelatinized plates at a density of 5 x 103 cells per well in DMEM medium (Gibco-BRL) containing heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (10%, Sigma) and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/mL-100 µg/mL, Sigma). The following day, the cells were treated with 2 µM of a given TrpRS in the presence of 2 nM VEGF165. After 72 hours of incubation, assays were performed by using the CellTiter 96® aqueous one-solution cell proliferation assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Results of the inhibition assay are shown in Figure 3 as the percentage of net proliferation of VEGF165. Each determination shown represents the mean of five experiments. As shown in Figure 3, human full-length TrpRS exhibited no angiostatic activity and human mini TrpRS was able to inhibit human VEGF165-induced cell proliferation. EXAMPLE 3 Angiostatic Effect of Human TrpRS on Endothelial Cell Migration The angiostatic activity of TrpRS was next evaluated in experiments testing the ability of human full-length TrpRS and human mini TrpRS to inhibit human VEGF165-induced or human mini TyrRS-induced cell migration. Cell migration assays were performed using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Clonetics, Walkersville, MD). Cells were maintained in EGM-2® BulletKit® medium (Clonetics) in an atmosphere of 6% CO2 at 37°C according to the supplier's instructions. Cell migration assays were performed using the modified Boyden chamber (6.5 mm Transwells) with polycarbonate membranes (8.0 µm pore size) (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) (Masood et al., 1999, Blood 93:1038-44). Wells were coated overnight with 25 µg/mL human fibronectin (Biosource International, Camarillo, CA) in PBS and then allowed to air-dry. HUVECs were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Gibco-BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) containing 0.1% BSA (Sigma) and 2 x 105 cells per well were added to the upper chamber. The chemotactic stimulus (50 nM mini TyrRS or 0.5 nM of human vascular endothelial growth factor-165 (VEGF165) (Biosource International, Camarillo, CA)) was placed in the lower chamber, and the cells were allowed to migrate for 6 hours at 37°C in a 6% CO2 incubator. After incubation, non-migrant cells were removed from the upper face of the Transwell membrane with a cotton swab and migrant cells, those attached to the lower face, were fixed in methanol and visualized with the Hemacolor® stain set (EM Diagnostic Systems, Gibbstown, NJ). Migrating cells were counted in high-power fields (HPFs). HUVECs were suspended in media with the inhibitor for 30 minutes before placement in the chamber. HUVEC samples were treated with 0.5 nM VEGF165, 50 nM mini TyrRS, and 500 nM of a given TrpRS. Four measurements of chemotaxis were done for each protein. Each determination shown in Figure 4 represents the average of nine HPF measurements. As shown in Figure 4, human mini TrpRS inhibited human VEGF165-induced and human mini TyrRS-induced HUVEC chemotaxis. In contrast, human full-length TrpRS had no effect on VEGF165-induced or mini TyrRS-induced HUVEC chemotaxis. EXAMPLE 4 Angiostatic Effect of Human TrpRS on in vivo Angiogenesis The angiostatic activity of human full-length TrpRS and human mini TrpRS was also analyzed in in vivo angiogenesis assays conducted in chick CAM. In vivo angiogenesis assays were performed as follows with 3 µg of full-length TrpRS or mini TrpRS added to VEGF165-induced or mini TyrRS-induced CAM tissue. In vivo angiogenesis assays were conducted in chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) (Nicolaou et al., 1998, Bioorg. Med. Chem. 6:1185-208). Ten-day-old chick embryos were purchased from Mcintyre Poultry (Lakeside, CA) and were incubated at 37°C and 70% humidity. A small hole was made with a small crafts drill (Dremel, Emerson Electric, Racine, WI) directly over the air sac at the end of the egg. The embryos were candled to determine a location to drill a second hole directly over embryonic blood vessels. Negative pressure was applied to the original hole, which resulted in the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) pulling away from the shell membrane and creating a false air sac. A window was cut in the eggshell over the dropped CAM, exposing the CAM to direct access for experimental manipulation. Cortisone acetate-treated 5 mm filter disks were soaked with a particular protein sample (25 ng of VEGF165 or 250 ng of mini TyrRS) and the filter disks added directly to the CAMs, which were relatively devoid of preexisting blood vessels. The windows were sealed with sterile tape and incubated at 37°C. At 0, 24, and 48 hours following incubation, 3 µg of interferon-alpha inducible protein (IP-10) (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was topically applied to the filter disks. After 72 hours, the CAM tissue associated with the filter disk was harvested and quantified using a stereomicroscope. Angiogenesis was assessed as the number of visible blood vessel branch points within the defined area of the filter disks. Each determination shown in Figure 5 represents the mean from 5-8 embryos. As shown in Figure 5, the angiogenic activity of human VEGF165 and human mini TyrRS was inhibited by human mini TrpRS. Human full-length TrpRS had no observable angiostatic activity. EXAMPLE 5 Secretion of Human TrpRS From U-937 Cells In order to determine whether TrpRS could be secreted from apoptotic tumor cells where it can be cleaved by PMN elastase, secretion assays using U-937 cells were performed as follows. Human histiocytic lymphoma U-937 cells were first grown in serum-free medium to induce apoptosis. Prior to growth in serum-free medium, U-937 cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% heat-treated FBS (Sigma), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin (Sigma) in an atmosphere of 6% CO2 in air at 37°C. U-937 cells were maintained in logarithmic growth phase by routine passage every 2-3 days. For serum-free growth, 4 x 106 U-937 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium without FBS for 24 hours. Apoptosis of U-937 cells was verified by DNA fragment assay, in which the characteristic DNA ladder for apoptotic cells was observed on an agarose gel. Cell supernatants were collected following growth of U-937 cells in serum-free media for 4,12, or 24 hours. These supernatants were then examined by Western blot analysis using a rabbit polyclonal anti-TrpRS antibody. To examine proteins in the cell supernatant, 20 mL of spent culture medium was first treated with 2 mM PMSF, 10 µg/mL aprotinin, 20 µg/mL leupeptin, and 10 µg/mL pepstatin A. Treated culture medium was concentrated using Centriprep-10 columns (Amicon, Beverly, MA) and then separated on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Following transfer onto an Immobilon-P™ membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), blots were blocked with PBS and 3% BSA and incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-TrpRS antibodies. After washing, blots were incubated with a 1:4000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Life Science, Arlington Heights, IL) for detection of TrpRS. As shown in Figure 6, human full-length TrpRS was secreted from apoptotic U-937 cells, but not from U-937 cells maintained under normal (i.e., serum) conditions. It was not possible to determine whether human mini TrpRS was also secreted from apoptotic tumor cells, since the amount of mini TrpRS generated from full-length TrpRS is comparatively small. EXAMPLE 6 Cleavage of Human TrpRS by PMN Elastase Cleavage of human full-length TrpRS by PMN elastase, a protease released from PMNs (Wright, et al., 1992, J. Cell. Biochem. 48: 344-55), was examined as follows. TrpRS was treated with PMN elastase in PBS (pH 7.4) at a protease: protein ratio of 1:3000 for 0, 15, 30, or 60 minutes. Following cleavage, samples were analyzed on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Immunoblot analysis was performed as described in Example 5. As shown in Figure 7, PMN elastase cleavage of the 54kDa full-length TrpRS generated a major fragment of 47 kDa and a minor fragment of 44 kDa. Both fragments were similar in size to the 49 kDa mini TrpRS fragment. Western blot analysis with antibodies directed against the carboxyl-terminal His6-tag of the recombinant TrpRS protein revealed that both fragments possessed the His6-tag at their carboxyl-terminus. Thus, only the amino-terminus of two TrpRS fragments has been truncated. The amino-terminal sequences of the TrpRS fragments were determined by Edman degradation using an ABI Model 494 sequencer. Sequencing of these fragments showed that the amino-terminal sequences were S-N-H-G-P (SEQ ID NO: 23) and S-A-K-G-I (SEQ ID NO: 24), indicating that the amino-terminal residues of the major and minor TrpRS fragments were located at positions 71 and 94, reespectively, of full-length TrpRS. The angiostatic activity of the major and minor TrpRS fragments was analyzed in HUVEC proliferation, HUVEC migration, and chick CAM in vivo angiogenesis assays (as described in Examples 2-4). Recombinant forms of the major and minor TrpRS fragments were prepared for use in these assays. As shown in Figure 8, the major TrpRS fragment (designated as supermini TrpRS) was capable of inhibiting VEGF165-stimulated orhuman mini TyrRS-stimulated angiogenesis. Supermini TrpRS was also capable of inhibiting HUVEC proliferation and migration. Thus, the major product of PMN elastase digestion of full-length TrpRS has angiostatic activity. In contrast, the minor TrpRS fragment (designated as inactive TrpRS) did not exhibit angiostatic activity. EXAMPLE 7 Human Mini TpRS Primary Structure Angiogenic mini TyrRS and angiostatic mini TrpRS and supermini TrpRS have their respective ELR and DLT motifs imbedded in closely similar Rossmann binding fold domains. In previous experiments, α-chemokines possessing the ELR motif have been shown to act as angiogenic factors and α-chemokines lacking the ELR motif have been shown to act as angiostatic factors (Strieter et al., supra). It appears that the biological balance of angiogenic (ELR) and angiostatic (non-ELR) α-chemokines regulates angiogenesis (id.). For example, the anti-tumorgenic IFN-γ induces production of IP-10 and MIG (angiostatic α-chemokines) and also attenuates the expression of IL-8 (angiogenic α-chemokine) (Gusella et al., 1993, J. Immunol. 151:2725-32). Similarly, in some cell lines TrpRS is highly expressed in the presence of IFN-γ. Mammalian TrpRS shares some sequence similarity with semaphorin-E and neuropilin-2 (Figures 9 and 10). Neuropilin is a receptor for two unrelated ligands with disparate activities: VEGF165, an angiogenic factor, and semaphorins, which are mediators of neuronal guidance (Chen et al., 1998, Neuron 21:1273-82; Neufeld et al., 1999, FASEB J. 13:9-22). Semaphorin-E is also a ligand for neuropilin-2 and semaphorin has been shown to be capable of blocking the binding of VEGF165 to neuropilin (Chen et al., supra). The sequence similarity of a portion of semaphorin-E to TrpRS suggests that human mini TrpRS and human supermini TrpRS bind neuropilin-2, thereby inhibiting VEGF165 binding to neuropilin-2. Since the shared sequence similarity between neuropilin-2 and TrpRS is located in the neuropilin-2 c-domain that is required for neuropilin-2 dimerization (Chen et al., supra) (Figure 10), human mini TrpRS and human supermini TrpRS may inhibit the dimerization of neuropilin-2. Mature EMAP II has been reported to be a cytokine with anti-angiogenic properties (Schwarz et al., 1999, J. Exp. Med. 190:341-54). Angiostatic mini TrpRS may be produced by alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA or, as shown in Example 6, angiostatic supermini TrpRS can be generated by PMN elastase cleavage. PMN elastase has been shown to be present in human colorectal carcinoma with particular enrichment at the tumor-host interface (Bjørnland et al., 1998, Int. J. Oncol. 12:353-40). Also, breast and non-small cell lung cancer cells are known to secrete PMN elastase in vitro (Yamashita et al., 1996, Chest 109:1328-34). Thus, human TrpRS, which is secreted from apoptotic cells, may be cleaved by PMN elastase at the tumor-host interface. The cleaved enzyme can then act as angiostatic factor that regulates tumor invasion.
