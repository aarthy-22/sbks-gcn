Mice deficient in glutathione transferase zeta/maleylacetoacetate isomerase exhibit a range of pathological changes and elevated expression of alpha, mu, and pi class glutathione transferases.
Glutathione transferase zeta (GSTZ1-1) is the major enzyme that catalyzes the metabolism of alpha-halo acids such as dichloroacetic acid, a carcinogenic contaminant of chlorinated water.
GSTZ1-1 is identical with maleylacetoacetate isomerase, which catalyzes the penultimate step in the catabolic pathways for phenylalanine and tyrosine.
In this study we have deleted the Gstz1 gene in BALB/c mice and characterized their phenotype.
Gstz1(-/-) mice do not have demonstrable activity with maleylacetone and alpha-halo acid substrates, and other GSTs do not compensate for the loss of this enzyme.
When fed a standard diet, the GSTZ1-1-deficient mice showed enlarged liver and kidneys as well as splenic atrophy.
Light and electron microscopic examination revealed multifocal hepatitis and ultrastructural changes in the kidney.
The addition of 3% (w/v) phenylalanine to the drinking water was lethal for young mice (<28 days old) and caused liver necrosis, macrovesicular steatosis, splenic atrophy, and a significant loss of circulating leukocytes in older surviving mice.
GSTZ1-1-deficient mice showed constitutive induction of alpha, mu, and pi class GSTs as well as NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1.
The overall response is consistent with the chronic accumulation of a toxic metabolite(s).
We detected the accumulation of succinylacetone in the serum of deficient mice but cannot exclude the possibility that maleylacetoacetate and maleylacetone may also accumulate.
