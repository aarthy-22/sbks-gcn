Retigabine, a novel anti-convulsant, enhances activation of KCNQ2/Q3 potassium channels.
Retigabine [N-(2-amino-4-[fluorobenzylamino]-phenyl) carbamic acid; D-23129] is a novel anticonvulsant, unrelated to currently available antiepileptic agents, with activity in a broad range of seizure models.
In the present study, we sought to determine whether retigabine could enhance current through M-like currents in PC12 cells and KCNQ2/Q3 K(+) channels expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-KCNQ2/Q3).
In differentiated PC12 cells, retigabine enhanced a linopirdine-sensitive current.
The effect of retigabine was associated with a slowing of M-like tail current deactivation in these cells.
Retigabine (0.1 to 10 microM) induced a potassium current and hyperpolarized CHO cells expressing KCNQ2/Q3 cells but not in wild-type cells.
Retigabine-induced currents in CHO-KCNQ2/Q3 cells were inhibited by 60.6 +/- 11% (n = 4) by the KCNQ2/Q3 blocker, linopirdine (10 microM), and 82.7 +/- 5.4% (n = 4) by BaCl(2) (10 mM).
The mechanism by which retigabine enhanced KCNQ2/Q3 currents involved large, drug-induced, leftward shifts in the voltage dependence of channel activation (-33.1 +/- 2.6 mV, n = 4, by 10 microM retigabine).
Retigabine shifted the voltage dependence of channel activation with an EC(50) value of 1.6 +/-
0.3 microM (slope factor was 1.2 +/- 0.1, n = 4 to 5 cells per concentration).
Retigabine (0.1 to 10 microM) also slowed the rate of channel deactivation, predominantly by increasing the contribution of a slowly deactivating tail current component.
Our findings identify KCNQ2/Q3 channels as a molecular target for retigabine and suggest that activation of KCNQ2/Q3 channels may be responsible for at least some of the anticonvulsant activity of this agent.
