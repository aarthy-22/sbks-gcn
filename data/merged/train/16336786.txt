Human brain pyridoxal-5'-phosphate phosphatase: production and characterization of monoclonal antibodies.
We cloned and expressed human pyridoxal-5\'-phosphate (PLP) phosphatase, the coenzymatically active form of vitamin B6, in Escherichia coli using pET15b vector.
Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were generated against purified human brain PLP phosphatase in mice, and four antibodies recognizing different epitopes were obtained, one of which inhibited PLP phosphatase.
The binding affinities of these four mAbs to PLP phosphatase, as determined using biosensor technology, showed that they had similar binding affinities.
Using the anti-PLP phosphatase antibodies as probes, we investigated their cross-reactivities in various mammalian and human tissues and cell lines.
The immunoreactive bands obtained on Western blots had molecular masses of ca.
33 kDa.
Similarly fractionated extracts of several mammalian cell lines all produced a single band of molecular mass 33 kDa.
We believe that these PLP phosphatase mAbs could be used as valuable immunodiagnostic reagents for the detection, identification, and characterization of various neurological diseases related to vitamin B6 abnormalities.
