Prophylactic effect of resveratrol against ethinylestradiol-induced liver cholestasis.
Estrogens, and particularly glucuronides such as ethinylestradiol (EE), have been shown to cause cholestasis in animal studies, by reducing bile acid uptake by hepatocytes.
The aim of the present article was to investigate anticholestatic activity of resveratrol (RES) against liver cholestasis induced by EE in adult female rats.
The daily oral administration of the RES at a concentration of 25 mg/kg body weight for 15 days to rats treated with EE (100 μg/kg body weight for 5 days) resulted in a significant protection against EE-induced decrease in both serum cholesterol and bile acid levels as well as against an increase of serum bilirubin concentration.
The treatment also resulted in a significant increase in hepatic superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and catalase activities as well as hepatic protein-bound and nonprotein sulfhydryl groups.
RES inhibited serum alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, pi-glutathione-S-transferase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and alpha-glutathione-S-transferase activities, as well as reduced serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha, nitric oxide, and hepatic malondialdehyde as compared to EE-treated rats.
The results clearly suggest that RES has a powerful prophylactic action in cholestasis induced by EE.
Taken together, RES has potential as a preventive and therapeutic agent for cholestasis and deserves clinical trial in the near future as an adjuvant therapy in women treated with estrogen.
