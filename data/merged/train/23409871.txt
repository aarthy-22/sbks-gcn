Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of indazole arylsulfonamides as allosteric CC-chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) antagonists.
A series of indazole arylsulfonamides were synthesized and examined as human CCR4 antagonists.
Methoxy- or hydroxyl-containing groups were the more potent indazole C4 substituents.
Only small groups were tolerated at C5, C6, or C7, with the C6 analogues being preferred.
The most potent N3-substituent was 5-chlorothiophene-2-sulfonamide.
N1 meta-substituted benzyl groups possessing an α-amino-3-[(methylamino)acyl]-group were the most potent N1-substituents.
Strongly basic amino groups had low oral absorption in vivo.
Less basic analogues, such as morpholines, had good oral absorption; however, they also had high clearance.
The most potent compound with high absorption in two species was analogue 6 (GSK2239633A), which was selected for further development.
Aryl sulfonamide antagonists bind to CCR4 at an intracellular allosteric site denoted site II.
X-ray diffraction studies on two indazole sulfonamide fragments suggested the presence of an important intramolecular interaction in the active conformation.
