Discovery and synthesis of novel 4-aminopyrrolopyrimidine Tie-2 kinase inhibitors for the treatment of solid tumors.
The synthesis and biological evaluation of novel Tie-2 kinase inhibitors are presented.
Based on the pyrrolopyrimidine chemotype, several new series are described, including the benzimidazole series by linking a benzimidazole to the C5-position of the 4-amino-pyrrolopyrimidine core and the ketophenyl series synthesized by incorporating a ketophenyl group to the C5-position.
Medicinal chemistry efforts led to potent Tie-2 inhibitors.
Compound 15, a ketophenyl pyrrolopyrimidine urea analog with improved physicochemical properties, demonstrated favorable in vitro attributes as well as dose responsive and robust oral tumor growth inhibition in animal models.
