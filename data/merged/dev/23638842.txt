Protective Role of (RS )-glucoraphanin Bioactivated with Myrosinase in an Experimental Model of Multiple Sclerosis.
AIM: The discovery of new natural compounds with pharmacological properties is a field of interest widely growing.
Recent literature shows that Brassica vegetables (Cruciferae) possess therapeutic effects particularly ascribed due to their content in glucosinolates, which upon myrosinase hydrolysis release the corresponding isothiocyanates.
This study examines the potential neuroprotective and immunomodulatory effects of (RS )-glucoraphanin from Tuscan black kale (Brassica oleracea L. var.
acephala sabellica) bioactivated with myrosinase (bioactive RS -GRA) (10 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally), in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of multiple sclerosis.
METHODS: EAE was induced by immunization with myelin oligodendroglial glycoprotein peptide (MOG35-55 ) in mice.
After immunization, mice were observed daily for signs of EAE and weight loss.
Clinical score was evaluated using a standardized scoring system.
RESULTS: By Western blot analysis of spinal cord tissues, we have demonstrated that treatment with bioactive RS -GRA significantly decreased nuclear factor (NF)-kB translocation, pro-inflammatory cytokine production such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and apoptosis (Bax and caspase 3 expression).
CONCLUSION: Our results clearly demonstrate that bioactive RS -GRA treatment may represent a useful therapeutic perspective in the treatment of this disease.
