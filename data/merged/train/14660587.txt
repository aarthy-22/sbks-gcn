Binding of the factor IX gamma-carboxyglutamic acid domain to the vitamin K-dependent gamma-glutamyl carboxylase active site induces an allosteric effect that may ensure processive carboxylation and regulate the release of carboxylated product.
Propeptides of the vitamin K-dependent proteins bind to an exosite on gamma-glutamyl carboxylase; while they are bound, multiple glutamic acids in the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain are carboxylated.
The role of the propeptides has been studied extensively; however, the role of the Gla domain in substrate binding is less well understood.
We used kinetic and fluorescence techniques to investigate the interactions of the carboxylase with a substrate containing the propeptide and Gla domain of factor IX (FIXproGla41).
In addition, we characterized the effect of the Gla domain and carboxylation on propeptide and substrate binding.
For the propeptide of factor IX (proFIX18), FIXproGla41, and carboxylated FIXproGla41, the Kd values were 50, 2.5, and 19.7 nM and the koff values were 273 x 10(-5), 9 x 10(-5), and 37 x 10(-5) s(-1), respectively.
The koff of proFIX18 is reduced 3-fold by FLEEL and 9-fold by the Gla domain (residues 1-46) of FIX.
The pre-steady state rate constants for carboxylation of FIXproGla41 was 0.02 s(-1) in enzyme excess and 0.016 s(-1) in substrate excess.
The steady state rate in substrate excess is 4.5 x 10(-4) s(-1).
These results demonstrate the following.
1) The pre-steady state carboxylation rate constant of FIXproGla41 is significantly slower than that of FLEEL.
2) The Gla domain plays an allosteric role in substrate-enzyme interactions.
3) Carboxylation reduces the allosteric effect.
4) The similarity between the steady state carboxylation rate constant and product dissociation rate constant suggests that product release is rate-limiting.
5) The increased dissociation rate after carboxylation contributes to the release of product.
