Toxic effects of chromium on tannery workers at Sialkot (Pakistan).
Chromium is widely used in the leather industry, and tannery workers are under constant threat of adverse health effects due to its excessive exposure.
Our objective was to find out the toxic effects of chromium on tannery workers at Sialkot, Pakistan.
A total of 240 males consisting of 120 workers from tanneries at Sialkot and equal number of controls were included.
Blood complete counts, high-sensitive C-reactive protein, malondialdehyde and routine biochemical tests were carried out by routine procedures.
Chromium levels in blood (BCr) and urine were analyzed using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer Perkin Elmer analyst-200.
Results revealed that all the workers were male with average age of 33 years and 15 (13%) had skin rashes, 14 (12%) had chronic bronchitis, 10 (8%) had gastritis and 4 (3%) conjunctivitis.
The tannery workers had significantly raised median (interquartile range) of BCr 569 (377-726) nmol/L as compared to 318 (245-397) nmol/L in the control (p < 0.001).
Sixty-five (54%) workers had BCr levels above the upper limit set by Agency for Toxic Substance and Drug Registry.
The urinary chromium excretion was significantly high in workers 131 (46-312) nmol/L as compared to 13 (3-26) nmol/L in controls (p < 0.01).
The workers had hematological, hepatic and renal function impairment because of oxidative stress on body systems.
It is concluded that about half of the workers had excessive exposure to chromium in the tanneries at Sialkot.
They had significantly raised chromium levels in their biological fluids and adverse health effects due to enhanced oxidative stress and inflammatory changes.
