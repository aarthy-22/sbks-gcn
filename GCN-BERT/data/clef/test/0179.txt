FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to vacuum assisted devices that require the use of a vacuum in order to attach to body parts and/or tissue. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A grasping cup, obstetric bonnet, or ventouse cap are some of the names given to the devices used in the field of obstetrics. These devices use a suction cup to assist in the vaginal and operative delivery of newborns. Typically, the suction cup is applied to the fetal scalp during the second stage (pushing through the birth canal) of labor. The obstetrician then applies traction to the infant's head via a flexible or rigid shaft with a handle coupled to the suction cup. The traction is applied in an outward fashion while the delivering mother pushes, thereby assisting in the delivery of the newborn. These suction cups are typically made of silicone, rubber, vinyl or other plastic, or combinations of plastic and rubber. Suction is generally applied through suction tubing which is coupled to a nipple on the vacuum cup, the nipple communicating with the interior of the cup. The method by which the suction is produced can vary from large stationary mechanical vacuum/suction devices to hand-held pumps similar to those which are used to bleed brake fluid from brake lines of automobiles. The suction cup has been reported to be safer than forceps and is intended to more gently ease a baby from the womb than forceps. Suction devices can also be used to manipulate tissue during surgery. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,196,003 to Bilweis discloses an endoscopic surgical instrument which includes a tube with a suction cup at one end and a bulb at its opposite end. The cup is placed on a target tissue and the bulb is compressed and released in order to apply suction to the tissue. The tissue is released by again compressing the bulb. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In an embodiment of the present invention, a pump is used to apply a vacuum to a vacuum device attached to a body part. The vacuum device comprises the suction device (or suction cup), a sensor for monitoring the vacuum applied to the suction device, a pump for increasing the vacuum to the suction device, a tube for applying the vacuum to the suction device and a control circuit for activating the pump. In an embodiment of the present invention, the control circuit is operated by the surgeon holding the suction device. In an embodiment of the present invention, the surgeon controls the vacuum applied while performing the surgical procedure. In an embodiment of the present invention, the suction device can be manipulated and the vacuum device can be controlled by a surgeon alone while the surgical procedure is carried out.

It should be noted that references to ‘an’ or ‘one’ embodiment in this disclosure are not necessarily to the same embodiment, and such references mean at least one. The treatment of open wounds too large to spontaneously close have long been a troublesome area of medical practice. The initial stage of healing is characterized by the formation of granulation tissue which can take several hours. When an open wound is present or formed during surgery, it is not feasible to wait for normal wound healing. In order to help address this situation, application of vacuum has been proposed as a sealing device for the abnormal tissue. If a tissue displays a site which is bleeding, a suction cup may be applied at that site to tamponade active bleeding until the surgery can progress sufficiently to repair or remove the structure in question. When a vacuum is applied to a suction cup on a structure having a blood flow, blood can typically pool inside the site, which may lead to the formation of a hematoma. When an obstetrical vacuum extractor is applied to a fetal scalp during vacuum extraction-assisted deliveries of newborns, for example, occasionally a small bruise or hematoma occurs on the scalp. Additionally, some soft tissue edema and swelling may occur on the area of the scalp where the vacuum was applied. There is a significant need for vacuum-assisted devices in surgical and obstetrical delivery procedures. For example procedures that involve the use of vacuum cups, grasping cups, a tamponade apparatus, or suction cups that attach to body tissue require the use of external vacuum generation pumps. Before describing the invention in detail, it is helpful to describe an example environment in which the invention may be implemented. The present invention is particularly useful in obstetrical delivery where the surgical procedure requires that a grasping cup or suction cup be attached to the fetal skull during the obstetrical delivery. Under these circumstances, monitoring of the suction cup can be partially obscured as the cup is attached in utero during the second stage of labor. The presence or absence of hair on the fetus scalp, the weight of the fetus and amount of fatty tissue on the scalp, the position of the fetus in the womb and the location that the suction device 435 is applied to the fetus scalp can all affect the effectiveness of this vacuum device 301 and the procedure for its use. In this manner, the vacuum device 301 can considerably assist the surgeon. The surgeon is able to diagnose on a continually unfolding basis the important features affecting the delivery procedure in a timely and accurate fashion and use this diagnosis to set appropriate vacuum levels for the vacuum device 301. Further, the ability of the surgeon to be able to make use of real-time changes to the delivery procedure in changing the vacuum levels applied to the vacuum device 301 to maintain the fixed vacuum to the suction device 435, can allow the surgeon to compensate for many of the variations related to these important features. Surgical and obstetrical delivery procedures require suction devices 435 including vacuum cups, grasping cups, a tamponade apparatus, or other fixtures that attach to body tissue. Each of these devices requires a vacuum be applied to attach the device to tissue. The vacuum can be applied by a pump. Further, these procedures require continual monitoring, manipulation and re-activation of the pump by the physician. As such, the monitoring and manipulation create additional workload that distracts the physician from the primary surgical task. Suction devices to manipulate tissue during surgery have exhibited various disadvantages. The suction devices are difficult to utilize in that the surgeon has very little control over the level of vacuum applied to the tissue. There is a check release valve on the hand-held pump, and the surgeon has the ability to re-pump up the vacuum. However, these tasks are difficult when the physician is concentrating on other facets of the surgical procedure. Importantly, the surgeon's ability to monitor the vacuum level that is applied through a suction cup and fine tune manipulations to increase or decrease vacuum pressure is very imprecise. Further, although the hand pumps can include a gauge, the physician does not have the time to visually monitor the gauge. More importantly, even if the physician had the ability to visually monitor the pressure of the gauge, the physician's manual reflexes would not allow the physician to react to the pressure fluctuations in time to avoid, for example, separation of the suction device. In an embodiment of the invention, the vacuum can prevent separation at the margin, i.e., at the suction device rim contact site. Further, releasing the vacuum on the tissue can only be carried out by releasing the check relief valve. Moreover, manipulation of the tissue using the suction device is limited by the direct application of force along the tube. In addition, the field of movement is not versatile, and may be inadequate for purposes of a given surgery. Additionally, applying the vacuum requires the assistance of a second medical professional. A vacuum of atmospheric pressure is 1 atmosphere=760 torr. Generally, “approximately” in this pressure range encompasses a range of pressures from below 7.6×103 torr to 7.6×101 torr. A pressure of below 10−3 torr would constitute a high vacuum. A pressure of below 10−2 torr would constitute a medium vacuum. A pressure between atmospheric pressure and a medium vacuum constitutes a low vacuum. In an embodiment of the invention a vacuum is sensed at a suction device 439. In an alternative embodiment of the invention a vacuum is sensed at a wound 510. In another embodiment of the invention a vacuum is sensed at a tissue. In an embodiment of the invention the vacuum sensed at the tissue compensates for out-gassing and leaks when the suction device is applied to the tissue. Generally, “approximately” in a low vacuum pressure range encompasses a range of pressures from between 5×10−1 torr to 5×10−2 torr. Generally, “approximately” in a medium vacuum pressure range encompasses a range of pressures from between 5×10−2 torr to 5×10−3 torr. In an embodiment of the invention, a marginal increase in vacuum is an increase of vacuum from 10−1 torr to 5×10−2 torr. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, a marginal increase in vacuum is an increase of vacuum from 5×10−2 torr to 10−2 torr. The vacuum device can operate to lower the pressure from atmospheric pressure to generate a high vacuum. In an embodiment of the invention, a low vacuum can be applied in for example obstetric suction devices. In an embodiment of the invention, a medium vacuum can be applied in for example orthopedic suction devices. In an embodiment of the invention, immediate release of a low vacuum reduces the vacuum to approximately atmospheric pressure in between a lower limit of approximately 0.1 second and an upper limit of approximately 0.5 second. In an embodiment of the invention, immediate release of a medium vacuum reduces the vacuum to approximately atmospheric pressure in between a lower limit of approximately 0.3 second and an upper limit of approximately 1.0 second. In an embodiment of the invention, a force of approximately 102 Newton can be applied to tissue with the vacuum device 301 through a suction device 439. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, a force of approximately 103 Newton can be applied to tissue with the vacuum device 301 through a suction device 439. In various embodiments of the invention, the vacuum device can allow grasping of structures through a suction device during various types of surgery. Any organ or structure that has a smooth surface to which a vacuum device can attach and manipulate can be a candidate for use with the vacuum device. U.S. Pat. No. 6,641,575 “SURGICAL VACUUM INSTRUMENT FOR RETRACTING, EXTRACTING, AND MANIPULATING TISSUE” by Neal M. Lonky outlines an “open cup grasper” suction device 435 as envisaged in various embodiments of the invention attached to the vacuum device 301. The “open cup graspers” can be adapted for use with the vacuum device for open abdominal (laparotomy), chest (thoracotomy), brain (craniotomy) or orthopedic uses (vacuum traction or manipulation of bony surfaces). In addition, there is a more retroperitoneal surgical approach that can benefit from the vacuum device 301. Urology surgeons use an incision in the back to get to the kidneys. During this surgery the kidneys or other surfaces can be manipulated using the vacuum device. Unexpectedly, it was found that application and maintenance of a fixed constant vacuum from a vacuum device prevented separation of the margin of the suction device from tissue when traction was applied or when patient movement jarred the margin of the device in the setting of tamponade of a bleeding site. In particular, it was found that the degree and range of motion, and amount of force which could be applied in traction, extraction, tamponade, and manipulation were all enhanced by the application of a constant vacuum. In discussions with surgery assistants during procedures where only the hand pump was available to a number of surgeons, it became apparent that a mechanical pump led to procedural failures due to surgeon fatigue. The effort required in constantly monitoring the pressure gauge and reinitiating the mechanical pumping by grasping and compressing the handle exacerbated psychological pressure and physical fatigue due to the surgical procedure. In experiments with an animal model or simulations with human tissue it was observed that “pop off” detachments were significantly minimized with the automated vacuum device 301. This result was unexpected based on the informal questioning of a group of five surgeons who were shown a prototype vacuum device 301 in these model or simulation environments. This result was also unexpected inasmuch as all surgeons consulted indicated that they did not know marginal separation was a factor that could be addressed by a constant vacuum pump until shown the prototype and/or the results. If traction force exceeds the pressure under the suction device (the attachment force), the suction device edge furthest from the traction point will lift and separate from the tissue, causing the leakage leading to cup “pop off”. Essentially, when that equilibrium is reached and the two pressures equilibrate, there is a slow leak. It was learned after consulting with surgical assistants that the surgeon does not sense this release and thereby cannot manually pump the hand-held vacuum pump to counteract the leakage in time before the suction device releases completely. Unexpectedly, it was found that a machine-driven pump sensor can detect the release as measured by the drop in vacuum, and compensate for the release by activating the automated pump and compensating for the partial release, thereby allowing application of greater traction force without experiencing “pop off”. When a suction device 435 is applied to a fetal scalp on which lanugo, vellus or terminal hair is present, the hair can disturb the seal between the suction device and the scalp and thereby result in a vacuum leak. Application of a constant vacuum can compensate for the vacuum leak allowing for traction, extraction, and manipulation of the fetal head. Once the head has exited the vagina the surgeon needs to be able to release the suction device and manually deliver the fetus. Complete venting of the relief valve 221 via a solenoid allows instantaneous release of the suction device 435. When a suction device is applied to an organ containing an uneven or obstructed tissue surface, the uneven surface can result in a vacuum leak. Application of a constant vacuum can compensate for the vacuum leak allowing for traction, extraction, and manipulation of the organ. Application of a suction device at a tissue site which is bleeding, with a constant vacuum, i.e., an applied vacuum that compensates for the changed clotting behavior of the wound with time, can allow enhanced clotting and cessation of the bleeding from the site. It could be expected that a vacuum device with a vacuum tube delivering a vacuum to a suction device applied to the wound would accelerate the flow of blood. Contrary to this preconceived idea, application of vacuum constricts the tissue at the margin of the bleeding site into/toward the bleeding site. As a result, the margin collapses, allowing pooling of blood and clotting factors aiding clotting and cessation of blood flow. In an embodiment of the invention, the timing and periodicity of the application of the vacuum can be applied in a pulsatile flow opposite that of a patient's pulse. In an embodiment of the invention, the vacuum can be applied to tissue. The tissue can include, epithelial layers, organs, osseous tissue, bony tissue and connective tissue exposed by an open incision during a laparotomy, thoracotomy, craniotomy, retroperitoneal surgery and orthopedic vacuum traction or manipulation of bony surfaces. In an embodiment of the invention, the vacuum can be applied to a wound when the surgeon senses diastoly to more actively collapse the wound. The wound can be one or more of a subcutaneous hematoma, an incision made by the surgeon, a site of removal of tissue by the surgeon, a site of removal of an organ made by the surgeon, one or more puncture holes being treated by the surgeon or one or more laceration sites being treated by the surgeon. Treating the wound can include stopping the blood flow from a site, reducing the blood from a site, assisting in the arrest of the flow of blood to a site, stopping the blood flow to a subcutaneous hematoma, reducing the blood flow to a subcutaneous hematoma, assisting in the arrest of the flow of blood to a subcutaneous hematoma limiting its size and scope. In an embodiment of the invention, the vacuum can be increased to the wound when the surgeon senses diastoly to more actively collapse the wound. In effect the surgeon can use the patient's own tissue and the suction device as a tourniquet and the vacuum can be increased to tighten the tourniquet. In an embodiment of the invention, marginally increased vacuum pressure can be applied in diastoly, and thereby more easily applied, and then the vacuum can be maintained to overcome the systolic pressure pulse, thus slowing or arresting the flow of blood. In an embodiment of the invention, the vacuum can be adjusted to compensate for the pulse pressure variation, maintaining or slightly exceeding the suction device vacuum against the higher systolic pressure to secure placement at or over the bleeding site. Maintenance of the suction device on the bleeding site will ultimately more actively collapse the wound. In various embodiments of the invention, the vacuum device 301 can increase or decrease the vacuum to the wound in synchronization with a patient's heart changing from diastol to systoly to more actively collapse the wound. In this manner, the clotting and cessation of blood flow of a wound can be further improved. It was unexpected that vacuum constriction applied when the patient's blood pressure is low could reduce bleeding. It was also unexpected that the ability of a surgeon to simultaneously perform surgery and monitor the pulse pressure would be near impossible, which was observed when we interviewed 5 surgeons in a simulation of a bleeding site event. Further, it is noted that undetected vacuum loss may result in the untoward premature detachment of the vacuum cup device from the body surface under manipulation. Improper or negligent operation of the vacuum pump, or the manipulation of the tissue in contact with the various procedure cups/devices, may hamper the medical procedure or damage the affected tissue. In the past, vacuum assisted devices or vacuum generating devices have not recorded or maintained a record of operation of parameters including the applied vacuum, vacuum leak being compensated, time of application, temperature, change in conditions during procedure, or notes regarding the classification of the surface and the nature of the problem addressed that can be reviewed and archived for inclusion in medical records. As such, these vacuum assist devices do not allow the physician to utilize insight and intuition to choose conditions for the procedure that are similar to conditions previously utilized. Finally, these vacuum assist devices do not allow the surgeon to select conditions based not only on the similarity of the procedure but also based on the surgeon performing the procedure. Post-surgical examination of the parameters used during a number of surgical procedures including vacuum applied, nature of tissue, evenness of surface, vacuum leak due to uneven surface, force of extraction/manipulation applied, time duration of vacuum applied and variation of vacuum applied, allow review and establishment of guidelines that advance the safety and efficacy of the various surgical procedures being undertaken for a given patient sub-population. By recording all the data obtained during surgery pertaining to the use of the vacuum device 301 and making this data available together with other details of the patient and the operating surgeon, a surgeon can store useful data and proactively select parameters for future use in similar circumstances based on stored data. For example, ultrasound analysis of the fetus prior to birth can be performed to determine how much hair is present on the fetal scalp. This information can be used to select appropriate conditions for use in the childbirth, should a suction device be required. In addition to the absence or presence of hair and the relative amount of hair, the surgeon can also select the size and type of the specific suction device 435, and the specific type of vacuum device 301, based on the performance characteristics of the specific suction device 435, and the specific type of vacuum device 301. During specific surgical procedures a variable vacuum can be desirable, where the vacuum applied to the suction device 435 is varied depending on the stage of the surgical procedure. In such circumstances, the surgeon can manually indicate the different stages of the surgical procedure through a single depression of a control unit 419 button or through voice-activated recognition and response by the vacuum device 301. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the different stages of the surgical procedure can be communicated to or noted by an assistant who enters the appropriate information in the vacuum device 301. In an embodiment of the invention, the control unit 419 is attached to the suction device 439. In an embodiment of the invention, the control unit 419 can be held by the surgeon while holding and controlling the suction device 439. In an embodiment of the invention, the control unit 419 can be held by the surgeon with the same hand holding and controlling the suction device 439. In various embodiments of the present invention, an electromechanical compact pump provides a sustained vacuum force to a variety of suction devices 435 applied to body tissue and surfaces for the purpose of grasping, manipulating, tamponade, and/or traction of body parts of a patient or a fetal skull during obstetrical delivery. In an embodiment of the present invention, the vacuum can be automatically regulated and monitored continuously by the vacuum device 301 to effect the uninterrupted generation of a constant vacuum pressure to prevent untoward release of the suction device from the affected body part or tissue. In an embodiment of the present invention, the vacuum can be automatically regulated and monitored continuously by the vacuum device 301 to effect the uninterrupted generation of a variable vacuum pressure to prevent untoward release of the suction device 435 from the affected body part or tissue. In an embodiment of the present invention, the desired vacuum provided by the vacuum device 301 can be preset by the operator and can be adjusted by the surgeon as necessary during a medical procedure. In an embodiment of the present invention, an electronic record of the vacuum pressure(s) vacuum leak, and time duration of the vacuum can be stored internally within the device. In an embodiment of the present invention, the electronic records can be retrieved by an accessory memory transfer device or transmitted by wired or wireless (RF/IR frequency) connection to an external computer or other receiving equipment (i.e. printer, mass storage device).

In an embodiment of the present invention, the vacuum device 301 can operate as a back-up vacuum pump in parallel with existing hand-operated vacuum pumps. In various embodiments of the present invention, improved and unique operation is provided when compared to non-regulated vacuum pumps.

In an embodiment of the present invention, the vacuum device 301 is hand held. In an embodiment of the present invention, the vacuum device 301 is portable. An electro-vacuum pump for assisting or regulating the vacuum obtained by hand-operated pumps has not previously been proposed or used. In an embodiment of the present invention, the vacuum device 301 improves performance of hand-operated pumps currently in use by providing sustained and regulated vacuum. In an embodiment of the invention, the surgeon selects the desired vacuum by applying the vacuum with a hand-held pump and the vacuum device 301 is used to maintain this pressure. In an embodiment of the present invention, the vacuum regulation provided by the invention prevents untoward release (“pop-offs”) of grasping cups and other suction devices 435 by automatically compensating for air leaks at the interface between the grasping cup and the adhered surface, or between the grasping cup and the vacuum device 301. In various embodiments of the invention, the portable regulated vacuum device 301 shown in FIG. 3 is a self-contained vacuum-producing device that provides preset regulated pressure(s) and electronically stores operational performance data for retrieval by external means.

In am embodiment of the invention, the vacuum device is activated by contact between the suction device and tissue. In an embodiment of the present invention, the vacuum selector switch 203 is a multiple position on-off switch that remains indefinitely at whichever position is selected. In an embodiment of the present invention, the vacuum selector switch 203 can provide three (3) positions. In an embodiment of the present invention, the vacuum selector switch 203 can provide ten (10) positions. In an embodiment of the present invention, the vacuum selector switch 203 can provide any number of positions between a minimum of three (3) positions and a maximum of ten (10) positions.

In an embodiment of the invention, the vacuum selector switch 203 can be used to select a “maintain” vacuum setting, wherein a vacuum generated by a hand-held vacuum pump is maintained by the electro-vacuum pump during the surgical procedure. In an embodiment of the present invention, the vacuum selector switch 203 position can be selected based on the surgical procedure being undertaken. In an embodiment of the present invention, the vacuum selector switch 203 position can be selected based on the identity of the surgeon performing the surgical procedure.

FIG. 1 is a schematic flow diagram used to exemplify the use of an embodiment of the present invention in a surgical procedure. The vacuum device 301 is initially in an ‘off’ state, with no power applied to the internal components. Prior to operation, the user attaches the suction device 435 via connector 425 (see FIG. 4) to the vacuum attachment port 206 of the vacuum device 301 using the vacuum assisted device tubing 308 at step 110. The suction device 435 is one of one or more devices that require vacuum assistance. Then the user applies power to the vacuum device 301 with power switch 202 at step 100 and positions selector switch 203 to the desired operating vacuum setting at step 105. When enabled with the foot switch 218 or the suction device control 419 (at step 115), the device processor circuitry 213 determines if the vacuum pump 214 is required to operate, or not, based upon the relationship between the user setting of the vacuum selector switch 203 and the signal magnitude of the vacuum sensor 211 (at steps 120 and 130). Once activated the vacuum device begins to monitor and store the data including the vacuum applied to the suction device, the vacuum at the vacuum pump, the vacuum loss (not shown in FIG. 1). If the vacuum sensor signal is lower than the desired vacuum, the pump control circuitry 210 is activated powering the vacuum pump 214 until the desired vacuum is reached (steps 140 and 160); as determined by the signal from the vacuum sensor 211 and the device processor circuitry 213. The relative vacuum pressure is annunciated by the LED bargraph indicator 205, with the value of the vacuum sensor 211 signal proportionately indicated by sequential LED indicator illumination from the bottom of the bargraph to the top. If the vacuum sensor signal is higher than the desired vacuum, the pump control circuitry 210 is not activated and the relief valve 221 is opened (step 150) to reduce the vacuum. If the vacuum sensor signal is within the limits the vacuum sensor continues to monitor the pressure (step 120) until the power switch 202 is turned ‘off’ (steps 170 and 180). During the operation of the vacuum device 301, vacuum pressure data can be stored in non-volatile memory that forms a part of the device processor circuitry 213. The vacuum pressure data can be stored sequentially with associated real-time (time of day) values that provide a direct correlation of the operating vacuum at a given time. The stored memory data can be retrieved by the user. In various embodiments of the invention, the stored memory data can be retrieved by: (a) negotiation and data download to an external device using the wireless communication circuitry 212; (b) insertion of a non-volatile memory device (flash/thumb drive) at the external memory and interface port 207; or (c) by request (serial communication) of a host computer connected to the external memory and interface port 207. With the operator display and controls 204, the user may perform various functions that affect the operation of the vacuum device 301; these functions include, but are not limited to: (i) adjust dead-band (+/− error range of vacuum signal when compared to desired setting) and dwell (delay time before/after allowable error is exceeded to activate/de-activate the pump) parameters; (ii) adjust preset vacuum values associated with the user vacuum selector switch 203; (iii) monitor vacuum pressure in real-time with display provided in selectable engineering units including mm/Hg, bar, mbar, torr, mtorr, PSI and kPa; (iv) retrieve and view stored time-stamped vacuum histogram values; and (v) adjust other system parameters associated with the functionality of the LED bargraph indicator 205 and communication protocols used by the external memory and interface port 207 and the wireless communication circuitry 212. In an embodiment of the present invention, the vacuum selector switch 203 can be expanded in functionality to include: more selections (positions), factory pre-set operational values. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the vacuum selector switch 203 can be eliminated completely and replaced by a single pre-set or adjustable setting through the use of the operator display and controls 204. In another embodiment of the present invention, the vacuum selector switch 203 can be set according to the surgical procedure being undertaken. In an embodiment of the present invention, the minimum and maximum pressure which can be selected during the surgical procedure can be based on the surgical procedure being undertaken. In an embodiment of the present invention, the minimum and maximum pressure which can be selected can be based on the stored identity of a surgeon carrying out the procedure. The identity of the surgeon carrying out the procedure can be detected through a RFID reader in the vacuum device 301 and a tag associated with the surgeon. In an embodiment of the present invention, the minimum and maximum pressure which can be selected during the surgical procedure can be restricted based on the surgical procedure being undertaken. The functionality of the LED bargraph indicator 205 can be expanded to allow user selected indications that provide: 0-100% indication of the vacuum sensor 211 signal, scaled to provide 0-100% indication of the vacuum selector switch pre-set range, or other user selected range of indication. Attachment of the external vacuum assisted device to the vacuum attachment port 206 can be accomplished using custom configured vacuum assisted device tubing 308 sections that are pre-fabricated and sized to provide the simple interface of devices currently used in the art. In an embodiment of the present invention, the vacuum device 301 can be reconfigured to utilize simple electronic circuit components eliminating the need for the device processor circuitry 213.

In an embodiment of the present invention, the invention can be used as an ancillary/back-up vacuum pump, in support of hand-operated vacuum devices. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the vacuum device 301 can be used as a stand-alone primary vacuum pump. In an embodiment of the present invention, the operator then decides the desired vacuum pressure required for the selected suction device 435 and uses either the vacuum selector switch 203 to choose an operating vacuum, adjusts the vacuum pressure selection using the functionality afforded by the operator display and controls 204 or uses the wireless control unit 419. In an embodiment of the present invention, once the portable regulated vacuum device 301 is set by the operator and powered on, the vacuum pump 214 can operate to reach and maintain the vacuum pressure setting when selected to do so by the foot switch 218 condition (on/off) or wireless control 419.

The vacuum 640 increases above the preset vacuum 610 and the trigger point to turn off the pump 214 occurs when the vacuum 640 exceeds the maximum acceptable vacuum 620. Once the pump 214 is turned off or the relief valve 221 opened, leakage and out gassing of adsorbed molecules result in an increase in the pressure (loss of vacuum) until the pump 214 is turned on when the vacuum 640 falls below the minimum acceptable vacuum 630. As the pump 214 is turned off and on the hysteresis is reduced and the preset vacuum 610 can be attained.

As shown in FIG. 7, when the vacuum device can be set at a preset vacuum 710, given by the maximum acceptable vacuum 720 and the minimum acceptable vacuum 730 and preset dwell time 750. After the vacuum 740 has attained a stable preset vacuum 710 (see FIG. 6), breaking the suction device seal, leakage and/or out-gassing of adsorbed molecules can result in an increase in the pressure (loss of vacuum). The dwell time 750 sets the wait time after the minimum acceptable vacuum has been triggered to turn on the pump 214. After the pump 214 is turned on the vacuum continues to fall until the pump 214 has compensated for the leak. Thereafter, the pump 214 increases the vacuum 740 above the preset vacuum 710 and the trigger point to turn off the pump 214 occurs when the vacuum 740 exceeds the maximum acceptable vacuum 720.
