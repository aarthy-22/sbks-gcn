Protective effect of butylated hydroxytoluene on ferric nitrilotriacetate induced hepatotoxicity and oxidative stress in mice.
The present study was undertaken to evaluate the possible ameliorating effect of butylated hydroxyl toluene (BHT), associated with ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA)-induced oxidative stress and liver injury in mice.
The treatment of mice with Fe-NTA alone enhances ornithine decarboxylase activity to 4.6 folds, protein carbonyl formation increased up to 2.9 folds and DNA synthesis expressed in terms of [(3)H] thymidine incorporation increased to 3.2 folds, and antioxidants and antioxidant enzymes decreased to 1.8-2.5 folds, compared with the corresponding saline-treated controls.
These changes were reversed significantly (p < 0.001) in animals receiving a pretreatment of BHT.
Our data show that BHT can reciprocate the toxic effects of Fe-NTA and can serve as a potent chemopreventive agent.
