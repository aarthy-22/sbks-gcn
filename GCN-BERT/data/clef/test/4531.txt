DEVICE FOR PREPARING BEVERAGES Field of the invention The present invention relates to a beverage dispenser configured for preparing beverages from soluble beverage ingredients, in particular pellets of soluble beverage ingredient Background of the invention Many beverages like coffee , milk beverages, chocolate beverages, ... are often prepared by mixing a soluble powder or a liquid concentrate with a diluent. Mixing devices are known for speedier preparation of such beverages by mixing the soluble component with the diluent, such as water. These devices typically comprise a mixing chamber in which the soluble component and the diluent are fed. The diluent can be introduced into the dissolution chamber in order to create a whirlpool to efficiently dissolve the soluble component in the hot water or the hot diluent can be introduced under the form of jets that provides mixing, dissolving and frothing. The mixture is then usually frothed by a rotor in a whipping chamber to reconstitute the beverage and produce foam. The beverage is then usually evacuated from the whipping chamber through the bottom of the chamber and dispensed into a receptacle for drinking. Such a device is illustrated for example in WO 2013/149942. Such devices of the prior art are configured for mixing beverage ingredient in the form of powder or concentrate with diluent. Yet beverage ingredient powder exists under the shape of pellets also. These pellets are issued from the compression of the powder. This form of beverage ingredients presents several advantages like taking less volume during storage, being easier to dose, limiting creation of fines and so dirtiness. The beverage ingredient pellets are commonly used to manually prepare a beverage in a cup by pouring water on the pellet. Such pellet usually comprises additives that help the instant dissolution of the pellet when water is poured. These additives increase the cost of the ingredient and can affect the usual taste of the beverage. On top of that, product can be perceived as less natural by the consumer. In the field of production of beverages with beverage preparation machines these pellets are not adapted due to costs reasons. Indeed beverage ingredient pellets are currently not used for preparing beverages with a beverage preparation machine because the type of machine such as described in WO 2013/149942 does not enable the crushing and dissolution of pellets. In the past US2552856 has proposed a crushing disc to break the pellets in the mixing chamber. Yet the crushing disc is very particular and current technology of whippers cannot be used. GB952687 has proposed a crushing member with grid-like members to disintegrate the pellet. Then the disintegrated pellets and water are introduced in a cup to produce the beverage. Such a beverage preparation does not produce beverages with a correct in-cup quality either in term of taste or aspect. There is need for a device for preparing beverage from compressed pellets of soluble beverage ingredients that can implement currently available technical elements and that produces beverage of quality. The object of the present invention is to propose a beverage dispenser able to produce beverages from compressed soluble beverage ingredients pellets or even soluble beverage ingredient powders. Summary of the invention According to a first aspect, the invention concerns a device for producing a beverage by mixing a soluble beverage ingredient with a diluent, said device comprising a mixing chamber, said mixing chamber comprising : - a cylindrical container comprising a top wall, a floor and a sidewall extending upwardly from the floor to the top wall to form a space inside the sidewall, the top wall and the floor wherein the beverage is mixed, said container having a longitudinal axis YY' centred therein and the floor of the container comprising an opening through which extends the end of a drive shaft oriented along a rotational axis XX', said rotational axis being inclined with respect to vertical, - a mixing device attached to the end of the drive shaft, - an outlet for evacuating the beverage from the mixing chamber, said outlet being positioned at the lowest position of the chamber, wherein the longitudinal axis YY' of the mixing chamber container and the rotational axis XX' of the drive shaft are collinear. The device of the present invention comprises a mixing chamber in which a dose of beverage ingredient and a dose of diluent can be introduced so that the ingredient dissolves in the diluent and produces a beverage. The mixing chamber presents the general shape of a container with a top wall, a floor and a sidewall, said sidewall being connected to the floor and extending upwardly from the floor to form a space inside the sidewall and the floor wherein the beverage is prepared. Preferably, the floor of the chamber is flat. The top wall, the floor and the sidewall walls of the container cooperate together to form a close container. As a consequence beverage can be mixed inside with no risk that beverage may leak therefrom. The container presents a longitudinal axis YY' centred therein. Preferably, the ratio of the height to the diameter of the cylindrical container is of at least 0,7, even more preferably comprised between 1 and 3. Generally the mixing chamber presents an internal volume configured for preparing a beverage for one person, that is to say the volume of current cup. Nevertheless according to another embodiment the mixing chamber can present a volume configured for producing several beverage portions at the same time. According to the invention the floor of the mixing chamber comprises an opening through which extends the end of a drive shaft oriented along a rotational axis XX'. The drive shaft is connected to a device for rotating said shaft. Said device is usually a motor positioned below the mixing chamber. A seal between the shaft and the opening is generally present to avoid beverage leaking. The rotational axis XX' is inclined with respect to vertical. Preferably the rotational axis XX' is oriented at an acute angle with respect to vertical. The rotational axis XX' can be oriented at an angle comprised between 10° and 60°, preferably between 20° and 30°, with respect to vertical. According to the invention the longitudinal axis YY' of the mixing chamber container and the rotational axis XX' of the drive shaft are collinear, and preferably identical. In one preferred embodiment the mixing chamber opening through which extends the end of the drive shaft is in the centre of the mixing chamber container floor and consequently the longitudinal axis YY' of the mixing chamber container and the rotational axis XX' of the drive shaft are identical. In another embodiment the mixing chamber opening through which extends the end of the drive shaft is distant from the centre of the mixing chamber container floor and consequently the longitudinal axis YY' of the mixing chamber container and the rotational axis XX' of the drive shaft are different but parallel. Preferably the end of the drive shaft extends through the opening in the floor of the container so that only the part configured for cooperating with a mixing device extends in the container. As a consequence, the rest of the shaft does not extend though the container and cleaning of the container remains simple. A mixing device is attached to the end of the drive shaft that extends in the mixing chamber so that the mixing device can rotate. The mixing device usually comprises at least one blade. The blade can present any shape configured for crushing pieces and agitating a beverage. Preferable the blade presents a shape such that when it is rotated it draws a path that is close to the floor and the lower part of the sidewall of the mixing chamber container. Such shape improves breaking of the pellets. Such a shape improves also shearing of the beverage fluid between the surface of the blade and the surface of the container walls leading to an efficient dissolution and eventually the creation of foam or crema depending on the nature of the beverage. Foam or crema formation can also depend on the speed of rotation. The preferred blade extends essentially in parallel to the chamber floor and presents an upright tip at its free end. The mixing device can comprise only one blade or several blades, either identical or different. Preferably the mixing device comprises symmetrical positioned blades in order to avoid vibrations. The blade can be made of metal or of plastic. The blade can present cutting edges. The chamber comprises an outlet for evacuating the beverage from the mixing chamber. The outlet is positioned at the lowest position of the chamber. Usually it is positioned at the intersection of the floor and the sidewall of the mixing chamber container. It is usually a simple hole connected to a downstream pipe. Generally the device of the present invention comprises a beverage dispensing assembly, said assembly comprising a tube connected to the outlet of the mixing chamber and essentially vertically oriented. Consequently the tube is essentially straight. In general, the outlet diameter is comprised between 2 mm and 10 mm. Preferably the tube diameter is dimensioned so that the beverage can evenly flow inside. If the tube diameter is too small, then a beverage with foam - like coffee crema of espresso - can be retained in the mixing chamber. Consequently the beverage dispensed in a receptacle downstream to the outlet tube does not present a nice aspect. On the contrary if the tube diameter is too large, the beverage can flow too rapidly and bubbles can appear in the receptacle when beverage splashes inside. Again the beverage dispensed in a receptacle downstream to the outlet tube would not present a nice aspect. Preferably the tube diameter is about 4 mm for dispensing coffee with a layer of crema like espresso. Preferably the tube diameter is comprised between 4 mm and 8 mm for dispensing a foamed milk-based beverage like a cappuccino According to the preferred embodiment the device of the present invention comprises a valve device configured for closing or opening the beverage path in the outlet tube. Preferably the valve device closes the beverage path in the tube by default. Consequently when beverage ingredient and diluent are introduced in the mixing chamber they cannot flow out from the opening at the bottom of the mixing chamber. Preferably the valve device is in the upstream part of the beverage dispensing assembly. Consequently only a small volume of diluent can enter in the assembly during the beverage preparation ; this would not affect the quality of the final beverage. According to a preferred embodiment, at least a part of the outlet tube of the dispensing assembly is made of a flexible and resilient material and the valve device is a pinching valve. The flexible and resilient material can be silicone rubber or any other material known for its flexible and resilient properties and food agreed. According to the preferred embodiment the outlet pipe is made of at least two parts, one first part being made of flexible and resilient material and another rigid part and positioned downstream to the first part. Generally the pinching valve comprises an abutment and at least one element movable between : - a first position wherein said valve pinches the part of the tube made of a flexible and resilient material against the abutment, and - a second position wherein said valve releases the part of the tube made of a flexible and resilient material. The movable element of the pinching valve can be moved between the two positions according to a translation movement or a rotational movement or a combination of these both movements. Usually the pinching valve pinches the tube along a direction perpendicular to the tube - that is a direction essentially perpendicular to the vertical axis. According to a particular embodiment, in the first position the valve can pinch the tube and deform it so that it is less apparent externally. According to one mode the valve device can be manually actuated by the consumer. The device can comprise an actuator like a button or a lever that indirectly moves the pinching valve. According to another mode the valve device can be automatically activated by a controller of the device during the beverage preparation cycle. According to one embodiment the chamber can comprise a diluent inlet. Generally the diluent inlet is positioned in the side wall of the mixing chamber, preferably near to the bottom. The diluent inlet is usually connected to a fluid system in order to supply the diluent from a diluent supply - e.g. a tank - to the diluent inlet. The fluid system can comprise at least a diluent supply and a pump, and optionally a fluid temperature adjustment device (heating or cooling). According to a specific embodiment the fluid temperature adjustment device can be integrated in the mixing chamber. In that embodiment the diluent is not heated or cooled but the beverage itself is heated or cooled during beverage preparation. According to one preferred embodiment the device can comprise a heating device to heat the beverage in the mixing chamber. The heating device can be positioned on the external sides of the mixing chamber container, for example the heating device can be a heating resistive ring. The heating device can be positioned at the bottom of the mixing chamber container, for example the heating device can be a heating stick or a serigraphic heating plate. According to another embodiment the chamber can be deprived of diluent system. Consequently the diluent is introduced in the mixing chamber by the consumer him/herself, generally through the top of the mixing chamber container. The consumer can heat or cool the diluent before introducing it in the mixing chamber or if a fluid temperature adjustment device is integrated in the mixing chamber, the diluent can be introduced at whatever temperature and the beverage itself is heated or cooled during beverage preparation. According to the preferred embodiment, the top wall is an openable cover. The cover avoids that beverage splashes out of the mixing chamber during the beverage preparation, which introduces a lot of mechanical energy in the mixing chamber. Preferably the cover comprises a hole so that the mixing chamber remains opened to the atmosphere when the cover is closed. So during beverage mixing air can be incorporated in the beverage and foam can be obtained. Moreover during beverage dispensing the beverage can evenly flow through the dispensing tube without creating undesired big bubbles in the drinking cup. Generally the hole in the cover is a conduit extending through the cover from the mixing chamber container side to the atmosphere side. According to a preferred embodiment, said conduit makes a right angle so that its external end is on the lateral wall of the cover and not on its top wall. Consequently there is no risk that beverage overflows during the mixing operation. Preferably, the cover is attached to the body of the device or to the top of the mixing chamber. In a particular embodiment, the cover is removable. Preferably the device of the present invention comprises a locking device. This locking device aims to keep the cover closed during beverage preparation. The cover can comprise a security switch which prevents the user from operating the device if the cover is open. The locking device can be a pin, a thread or a bayonet device cooperating with a hole, a thread or a slot respectively in the device. The locking device can also consist in a magnet. The cover can also enable the customer to introduce his/her own dose of diluent in the mixing chamber if the device is deprived of a diluent fluid system. The cover also enables the customer to introduce the soluble beverage ingredient for the beverage preparation if the device is deprived of container for storing and dosing said ingredient. The cover also enables the customer to introduce additives like flavours, sweeteners, vitamins, ice cubes in order to add them to the beverage during the preparation. According to an embodiment the device of the present invention can comprise a beverage ingredient storing container. Generally this container is positioned above the mixing chamber so the soluble beverage ingredient can fall by gravity in the mixing chamber when it is dosed. The dosing operation can be manual or automatic. According to a second aspect the invention concerns a process for the preparation of a beverage with a device according such as described hereabove wherein the following steps are implemented : a) introducing at least one liquid in the mixing chamber container, b) mixing the at least one liquid component with the blade, c) dispensing the beverage through the outlet. According to one mode in step a) a soluble beverage ingredient is introduced in the mixing chamber container and the at least one liquid component is a diluent. The soluble beverage ingredient can be an instant beverage powder like instant coffee, 3- in-1 powder, milk powder, instant tea, chocolate powder, soup powder. The soluble beverage ingredient can also be a liquid beverage concentrate like a coffee or tea concentrate, beverage syrup, a milk concentrate. Additives like flavours, sweeteners, vitamins, ice cubes (for preparing cold beverages) can be introduced in the mixing chamber with the main soluble beverage ingredient too. Preferably the soluble beverage ingredient is a pellet of compressed soluble beverage ingredient. The diluent is usually water, but other diluent like milk can be used. Water can be previously heated, for example in a kettle. When a beverage is prepared from a soluble beverage powder and a liquid, the liquid is usually introduced in the mixing chamber container before the powder. Accordingly powder does not pour directly into the outlet tube which could block the outlet or provide a bad in-cup quality beverage. According to another mode, the device can also be used to mix a ready-to-drink beverage with the aim to froth it and introduce air inside. This ready-to-drink beverage is usually milk. According to an embodiment the device comprises an openable cover and during step a) at least one of the soluble beverage ingredient and the diluent are manually introduced. According to another embodiment the device comprises a beverage ingredient pellets storage container and at least one pellet is manually or automatically introduced in the mixing chamber during step a). The time length of mixing step b) can be controlled to adjust the quantity of crema or foam in the beverage. According to a first variant the time length depends on the time length during which the customer presses the first button. So the user can customise his/her beverage by pressing the mixing button during a certain time. The longer the mixing sequence, the higher the quantity of crema or foam. According to a second variant, the time length is automatically set. This time length could also be varied by adding a potentiometer or a cursor on the device body, which would set the mixing time and therefore keep it adjustable by the user. According to the preferred embodiment of the process, mixing is stopped before the dispensing step c) is implemented. During step c) the user can press more or less the second button in order to control the flow of beverage in the drinking cup. The cleaning of the device can be achieved by rinsing it under tap water. A sponge can be used if milk is used. In addition, a small brush can be used to clean the inside of the beverage dispensing assembly tube, especially if milk is used. Another way of rinsing the device is to pour water inside the mixing chamber, trigger the mixing, and then pour the rinsing water in a container or a sink. This operation is more efficient with hot water. In the present application the terms "bottom", "top", "upper", "lateral", "upwardly", "horizontal" and "vertical" are used to describe the relational positioning of features of the invention. These terms should be understood to refer to the device in its normal orientation when put down as shown for example in Figures 1 , 2, 3. More specifically "bottom" and "top" refers to the common sense of these terms relatively to vertical. As an example a bottom wall is vertically positioned under a top wall. In the present application the terms "essentially vertical" cover orientations presenting an angle with vertical comprised between -10° and +10°. Brief description of the drawings The characteristics and advantages of the invention will be better understood in relation to the following figures, wherein : - Figure 1 is a perspective view of the device of the present invention, - Figure 2 is a side view of the device of Figure 1 , in which the shell parts have been removed to make internal elements apparent, - Figure 3 is a partial section view AA of the device of Figures 1 and 2, - Figure 4 is a perspective view of the locking device of the cover of the device of Figure 2, - Figures 5a-5f are views of the beverage dispensing assembly of the device of Figure 1. - Figure 6 illustrates an embodiment of the device connected to a diluent supply system. Detailed description of the drawings Figure 1 illustrates a device 1 for preparing beverages according to the invention. Externally the presents a dispensing area 14 where a drinking receptacle can be placed in order to receive the beverage prepared by the machine and dispensed through the beverage dispensing tube 31. In order to prepare a beverage the customer can open the cover assembly 7 of the machine by actuating the locking device 72 and get access to the mixing chamber of the device. Once beverage ingredients have been introduced in the device, the beverage preparation can be activated by pushing a lever 34 to the left in direction of a button 4a illustrating a mixing operation. In the illustrated embodiment the customer can choose the time length of the mixing : as long as he/she pushes the lever to the left mixing occurs. Then the customer pushes the lever 34 to the right in direction of a button 4b illustrating a dispensing operation sot that the beverage is the dispensing area 14. Figure 2 is a side view of the device of Figure 1 , in which the shell parts have been removed to make apparent the internal elements. The device comprises a mixing chamber comprising a mixing container 2 in which the beverage can be prepared. A shaft 24 extends through the chamber floor 21 and is connected at its lower end to a motor 5. The motor is energised by a battery (not represented). An internal electric circuit (not represented) enables the activation of the motor by the lever 34. The device comprises a beverage dispensing assembly 32 for dispensing the beverage form the mixing chamber outlet inside a drinking receptacle placed under the outlet of the tube 31 . This assembly cooperates with the tube 31 connected to the outlet of the mixing chamber container 2. The device comprises a docking base 15 supporting the above elements. According to a particular embodiment the upper part of the device comprising the key elements of the device like the mixing chamber, the beverage dispensing assembly and the motor are removable from the docking base 15, for example for cleaning under tap. Generally the docking base gives the with the correct orientation to the mixing device. When removed from the docking base 15, the upper part can be used in a secondary docking base, for example a base configured for being integrated in a car. This secondary base can be configured so that the global volume or foot print of the device is reduced compared to the device with the docking base 15. This second docking base can comprise a battery for energising the motor, The mixing chamber is surrounded by a heater 16 in the form of a ring. Consequently the beverage is heated during its preparation. In another embodiment not illustrated the docking station can comprise a water pump and a heater. In that case, the heater around the mixing chamber is not necessary. Figure 3 is a section view of some of the internal elements of the device 1 according to the plan AA illustrated in Figure 1. In particular this figure shows the internal elements of the mixing chamber. The mixing chamber comprises the mixing container 2 in which the beverage can be prepared. The container 2 comprises a floor 21 and a sidewall 22 extending upwardly from the floor to form a space inside the sidewall and the floor wherein the beverage is mixed. Preferably the floor is flat and the cross section of the side wall is circular, the container forming a cylindrical container presenting a longitudinal axis YY'. The floor comprises a central opening 23 through which extends the drive shaft 24 oriented along a rotational axis XX'. This rotational axis XX' is inclined with respect to vertical V along an angle a. This angle is acute and is of 20° in the illustrated embodiment. A mixing device 25 is attached to the drive shaft 24. Preferably the blade presents a shape so as to implement an efficient mixing of a liquid inside the container 2. In the present device the mixing device 25 comprises two symmetrical blades parallel to the floor 21 and bent upwardly at their end. The rotational axis XX' of the shaft of the mixing chamber and the longitudinal axis YY' of the chamber are identical. Consequently the mixing chamber is inclined along an angle of 20° with respect to vertical too. The mixing chamber comprises an outlet 26 for evacuating the beverage from the container 2. The outlet 26 is positioned at the intersection of the floor 21 and the sidewall 22. This intersection corresponds to the lowest position of the chamber. Due to this position beverage can be totally evacuated from the chamber container 2, the floor 21 and the side wall 22 forming a funnel leading the liquid to the outlet 26. The device comprises a beverage dispensing assembly for dispensing the beverage form the mixing chamber outlet 26 inside a drinking receptacle. This assembly comprises a tube 31 connected to the outlet of the mixing chamber and essentially oriented along a longitudinal axis ZZ'. The tube 31 can be composed of different tubular parts : for example, as illustrated in Figure 3, the tube is made : - of an upstream first tube 31 a protruding from the chamber container material, - of a second tube 33 made of a flexible and resilient material which cooperates with a valve device as explained hereunder, and - of a downstream third tube 31 b. The longitudinal axis ZZ' of the tube 31 is essentially vertical. In the illustrated embodiment the longitudinal axis ZZ' is oriented at an angle β of 8° with respect to vertical. This angle usually presents a value not greater than 10°. The combination of this essentially vertical orientation of the dispensing tube 31 and the position of the mixing chamber container outlet 26 at the lowest position due to the orientation of the rotational and longitudinal axis XX' and YY' enable an optimal dispensing of the beverage either in terms of quantity (the mixed beverage is fully dispensed) or quality (all the foam is dispensed). Figure 2 also illustrates the presence of a hole 71 through the cover 70 of the mixing chamber and the cover assembly 7 so that the mixing chamber remains opened to the atmosphere when the cover is closed. The hole in the cover is a conduit extending through the cover from the mixing chamber container side to the atmosphere side. The conduit makes a right angle so that its external end is on the lateral wall of the cover and not on its top wall. Consequently there is no risk that beverage overflows during the mixing operation. The cover assembly 7 comprises a locking device 72 in order to lock the cover 70 of the mixing chamber, in particular during the beverage preparation. This security avoids that the consumer may be injured by the rotating blade or that beverage splashes out of the mixing chamber. Preferably Figure 4 is a perspective view of the locking device 72 of the cover. The locking device comprises two movable studs 721 a and 721 b that can be slid horizontally to enter in two corresponding notches (not illustrated) in a fixed ring 73 (illustrated in Figure 3) positioned at the top the mixing chamber. The studs are made movable by a rotating plate 724 comprising two curved guiding curves 725a, 725b, each curved guiding curve cooperating with a guiding pin 722a, 722b attached to a movable stud 721 a, 721 b respectively. The rotating disk 724 is attached to a shaft 726. The shaft 726 presents at its upper end an actuator 727 for manually rotating the shaft like a key. Each guiding pin 722a, 722b cooperate also with a linear guiding curve 723a, 723b respectively provided in a fixed plate 723. Each pair of linear and curved guiding curves 725a/723a, 725b/723b are designed so that the rotation of the shaft 726 creates a linear displacement of the guiding pin between a position close to the shaft and a position far from the shaft and vice-versa. Preferably at least one of the movable studs 721 a, 721 b cooperates with a security switch so that the blade cannot be activated if the cover is not closed and locked and the movable stud does not contact the switch. This security avoids that the consumer may be injured by the rotating blade or that beverage splashes out of the mixing chamber. The illustrated locking device can be replaced by any other known locking device currently used for locking a cover. Figure 3 illustrates how the assembly of the motor, the mixing chamber and beverage dispensing assembly is supported by a base 15. This base provides a flat basement 15a to put down the device on a flat work surface 11 for example in a kitchen and an erected body 15b configured for orienting the assembly of the motor, the mixing chamber and beverage dispensing assembly with respect to vertical according to the invention. In the illustrated embodiment the erected body 15b presents a bottom part essentially vertically oriented and an upper part inclined with respect to vertical according to the invention. The bottom part essentially vertically oriented aims to give more stability to the device. There is a hollowing-out 15c - illustrated din Figure 1 - in the basement for placing the cup under the outlet of the tube 31 . The flat basement 15a can include a drip tray under the outlet of the tube 31. Figures 5a to 5f illustrate the beverage dispensing assembly of the device. Figure 5a is partial perspective view of device of Figure 1 in which external shell parts have been removed to show the mechanism of the beverage dispensing assembly. The lever 34 can be rotated either in direction of the button 4a to activate the mixing of the beverage in the mixing chamber or in direction of the button 4b to dispense the mixed beverage through the tube outlet 31 b. At rest, the lever 34 is positioned in the middle of the two positions and the two buttons as illustrated in Figure 5a. Figure 5b is a magnified view of the beverage dispensing assembly 32 of Figure 5a. It can be seen that at rest the flexible and resilient tube 33 is pinched between a movable valve element 323 and an abutment 326 so that no liquid can flow through the tube. The different elements of the assembly are supported by a plate 325. Figure 5c is a back view of the beverage dispensing assembly 32 of Figure 5b showing the mechanism for moving the movable valve element 323 and Figure 5d is a magnified view of a part of Figure 5c. The movable valve element 323 is attached to a first gear element 321 so that rotation of this element rotates the movable pinching element 323. The teeth of the first gear element 321 are engaged with the teeth of a second gear element 322 so that the rotation of the second gear element in one direction causes the rotation of the first gear element - and implicitly the movable pinching element - in the opposed direction. The second gear element 322 cooperates with the lever 34 so that the movement of the lever causes the movement of the second gear element : the central axis BB' of the second gear element extends longitudinally and presents a pin 322a perpendicular to the axis BB' that is engaged in a notch 341 at the basis of the lever 34. Figure 5e shows the second gear element and the pin 322a attached to the axis BB' of the second gear element removed from the notch. Only one edge 341 a of the notch 341 cooperates with one edge 322a of the pin 322. Figure 5f shows the lever and its notch 341 cooperating with the second gear element. The lever 34 can draw the pin 322a and the second gear element 322 only in one direction corresponding to the arrow F of Figure 5c. This direction corresponds to the direction of the second button 4b in Figure 5a and enabling the customer to dispense the prepared beverage. Actually the second gear element rotates the first gear element 321 in the other sense which moves the movable pinching element 323 upwardly and moves it away from the abutment 326 : so the path in the flexible and resilient tube 33 is opened and the beverage can be dispensed. The beverage dispensing assembly comprises a spring 324 to force the first gear element 321 to come back to the rest position when the customer does not exert any force on the lever 34. On the contrary when the lever 34 is rotated in direction of the first button 4a according to the arrow G of Figure 5c the pin 322a of the second gear element is not engaged by any edge of the notch 341 and no movement of the gearing elements and the movable pinching element occurs. The tube remains pinched and no beverage can be dispensed. This position of the lever 34 corresponds to the mixing operation. Preferably the device comprises two electric or magnetic switches 342a, 342b for detecting the position of the lever. Figure 6 illustrates a particular embodiment of the device of the present invention wherein the mixing chamber is connected to a diluent system comprising a supply of water 17 - here a simple bottle of water - a pump 18 and a pipe connecting the pump and the mixing chamber though the back of the device 1 . The pump 18 can be a simple manual pump requiring the customer to pump the water in the mixing chamber. The docking base 15 can comprise an extension 15c to place the supply of water next to the device. The pump can also be an electric pump. The volume of pumped water can be automatically fixed or selected by the user who can stop the pump when the desired volume is reached. The device of the present invention presents the advantage of implementing current available technologies like a cylindrical chamber, a blade and pinching valve and assembled to enable the production of beverages from compressed pellets. Another advantage of the device is that due to the inclination of the rotational axis the device does not present an important height. Another advantage of the device is that its chamber can be rinsed and cleaned efficiently due to the position of the chamber outlet at the lowest position of the chamber container. Another advantage of the device is that for beverages prepared with foam inside the mixing chamber, the foam can be efficiently delivered in the drinking cup due to the position of the chamber outlet at the lowest position of the chamber container.
