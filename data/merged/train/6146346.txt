Astemizole, a potent histamine H1-receptor antagonist: effect in allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, on antigen and histamine induced skin weal responses and relationship to serum levels.
The efficacy of astemizole, a new, long acting, oral histamine H1-receptor antagonist was compared to placebo for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis during the grass pollen season of 1982.
Sixty-three patients with a positive skin prick test to grass pollen and current symptoms participated in an 8 week, double-blind, randomized study.
Astemizole, 10 mg, was significantly better than placebo in alleviating both nose (P less than 0.05) and eye (P less than 0.01) symptoms despite significantly greater use of the reserve medication, clemastine, by the placebo group (P less than 0.003).
There was a lag period of 5 days after initiation of therapy before treatment benefit became manifest.
Subdivision of nasal symptoms indicated significant improvement compared to placebo over the 8 weeks for sneezing (P less than 0.05) and runny nose (P less than 0.05) but not blocked nose.
The absence of effect on nasal blockage was confirmed by parallel measurement of nasal calibre by body plethysmography.
The antihistaminic potency of astemizole was indicated by an 80% inhibition of the histamine induced skin weal response after 8 weeks therapy.
A positive correlation was found between serum drug levels and % inhibition of histamine skin weal (r = 0.64, P less than 0.001).
Astemizole was free from adverse sedative or anticholinergic effects but did cause a mean increase in weight of 1.3 kg (P less than 0.01) after 8 weeks therapy, not found with placebo.
