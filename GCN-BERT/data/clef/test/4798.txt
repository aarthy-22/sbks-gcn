Technical Field An object of the present invention is a new process for synthesis of the active pharmaceutical ingredient Lapatinib and salts thereof. Background Art Lapatinib is an active pharmaceutical ingredient used for the treatment of advanced metastatic lung cancer and is currently on the market under the name Tykerb, sold by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). According to the manufacturer's instructions, the commercial product Tykerb contains Lapatinib as the ditosylate monohydrate salt of formula (I-bis): having the chemical name N-{3-Chloro-4-[(3-fluorobenzyl)oxy]phenyl}-6-[5-({[2-(methylsulphonyl)ethyl]amino}methyl)furan-2-yl] quinazolin-4-amine bis(4-methylbenzenesulphonate) monohydrate, CAS RN 388082-78-8 and m. p. 250-256°C. This substance can be prepared according to teachings of the prior art such as for example those contained in US7,157,466. In particular, in said reference, examples 10 and 11 show the preparation of the ditosylate monohydrate salt starting from the anhydrous ditosylate salt. The aforementioned process suffers from the main disadvantage consisting in that said intermediates such as for example that having the aldehyde function in free form being poorly soluble, thus leading to low productivity. In other processes of the known art, stannane intermediates are used resulting in problems related to waste disposal. In general the known processes for the preparation of Lapatinb suffer of a low overall molar yield. Summary of invention The problem addressed by the present invention regards the provision of an improved process for the preparation of Lapatinib and salts thereof, which allows at least partially overcoming the aforementioned drawbacks with reference to the prior art. This problem is resolved through a process for the synthesis of Lapatinib as outlined in the attached claims, whose definitions are an integral part of the present description. Further characteristics and advantages of the process according to the invention will be apparent from the description - indicated hereinafter - of preferred embodiments, provided by means of non-limiting example. Brief description of drawings Fig.1 shows the scheme of the process for the synthesis of Lapatinib according to the present invention.

The process of the present invention thus provides two alternative routes for the preparation of the key intermediate, according to the process of the present invention, for the synthesis of Lapatinib and salts thereof, namely the N-protected-6-[5-({[2-(methylsulphonyl)ethyl]amino}methyl)furan-2-yl] quinazolin-4-ole of formula (IV): wherein R has the same meaning as described in step (b); In particular, said process comprises the following steps: (a) Deprotection reaction of the compound 2-(methylsulphonyl)-N-({5-[4-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yloxy)quinazolin-6-yl]furan-2-yl}methyl)ethanamine of formula (II): to give the compound 6-[5-({[2-(methylsulphonyl)ethyl]amino}methyl) furan-2-yl] quinazolin-4-ole of formula (III) or a salt thereof: (b) Amine protection reaction of the intermediate of formula (III) to give the compound of formula (IV); or, alternatively, comprising the following steps: (a-bis) Amine protection reaction of the intermediate of formula (II) to give the N-protected-2-(methylsulphonyl)-N-({5-[4-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran- 2-yloxy)quinazolin-6-yl]furan-2-yl}methyl)ethanamine of formula (III-bis): wherein R has the same meaning as described in step (b) of claim 1;(b-bis) Deprotection reaction of the intermediate of formula (III-bis) to give the compound of formula (IV). All the amine function protecting groups that are cleavable under basic conditions can be employed to implement the present invention, according to the compounds of formula (IV), (V), (VII) and (III-bis), the compounds of which, since they cannot be specifically claimed, must be intended as comprised within the scope of protection of the present invention since they allow the application of said inventive concept. Vice-versa, the intermediates of formula (IV), (V), (VII) and (III-bis) wherein R is Boc (t-BuO(CO)) are not comprised in the present invention since it is an amine function protection group that is not cleavable in basic conditions. The same applies to the compounds of formula (IV), (V), (VII) and (III-bis) wherein R is Z, i.e. Cbz, carbobenzyloxy. For a more comprehensive description of the amine function protecting groups that are cleavable in basic conditions, please refer to the knowledge of those skilled in the field, which can be deduced from the work by T. W. Green, P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Fourth Edition, Wiley-Interscience, New York, 2007 the content of which, with regard to the description of the aforementioned protecting groups, should be understood as comprised in the present invention. In one preferred embodiment, the process of the present invention for the preparation of Lapatinib and its key intermediate of formula (IV) is conveniently carried out employing the intermediates of formula (IV), (V), (VII) and (III-bis) wherein R is trifluoroacetyl or Fmoc, i.e. 9-Fluorenylmethyl oxycarbonyl having the following structure: In a more preferred embodiment of the process of the present invention for the preparation of Lapatinib and of its key intermediate of formula (IV), it is conveniently carried out using those intermediate compounds in which R is trifluoroacetyl since said group has a low molecular weight, allowing the handling of lower mass amounts of product and better atom-economy. The compound of formula (IV) particularly preferred is therefore the 2,2,2-trifluoro-N-{[5-(4-hydroxyquinazolin-6-yl)furan-2-yl]methyl}-N- [2-(methylsulphonyl)ethyl] acetamide of formula (IV, R=CF3(CO)): Obviously, the compound of formula (IV) can also be in the following tautomeric form, which is therefore comprised in the scope of the present invention. The key compound of formula (IV), according to step c) of the present invention is converted into a compound of formula (V). The preferred compound of formula (V) is that in which X is chlorine since, in comparison to the compounds wherein X is e.g. Br, I, or O-Ms, it has a lower molecular weight, furthermore, it is possible to prepare it more easily and its preparation is less expensive since it uses very inexpensive chlorination reagents such as, e.g., thionyl chloride, phosphoxychloride (i.e. phosphorus oxychloride) and oxalyl chloride. According to a particularly preferred embodiment the process of the present invention for the preparation of Lapatinib is carried out using compounds wherein R is trifluoroacetyl and X is Chlorine. A particularly preferred compound is thus the N-{[5-(4-chloroquinazolin-6-yl)furan-2-yl]methyl}-2,2,2-trifluoro-N-[2-(methylsulphonyl)ethyl]acetamide having the following structural formula (V; R=CF3(CO), X=Cl): The N-trifloroacetylated Lapatinib having the following structural formula (VII, R=CF3(CO)): is this another particularly preferred compound of the present invention. In general, the particularly preferred processes and the related intermediates of the present invention are those in which R is trifluoroacetyl. The compound of formula (III), derived from step a) of the present invention can be conveniently isolated as a sulphate salt having the following structural formula (III; H2SO4): The related tautomeric form is also reported: Said solid form is particularly preferred because, unlike other salts of the compound of formula (III) it has a crystalline form, it is easily filterable and allows the attainment of particularly higher yields, even quantitative for step (a). This is due to the complete insolubility or very poor solubility of said salt in the solvent selected to perform the isolation of said salt. Is not necessary to isolate all the intermediates involved in the present synthetic process. Indeed, according to one preferred embodiment it is convenient not to isolate the intermediates of formula (V) and (VII) so that it is possible to pass directly in one-pot from the intermediate of formula (IV) to Lapatinib free base or a salt thereof, preferably to the ditosylate salt or to the ditosylate monohydrate salt. The following compounds are therefore intermediates of the Lapatinib synthetic process according to the present invention: (a) N-protected-6-[5-({[2-(methylsulphonyl)ethyl] amino}methyl)furan-2-yl]quinazolin-4-ole of formula (IV): wherein R has the same meaning as described in step (b);(b) N-protected-N-{[5-(4-substituted-quinazolin-6-yl)furan-2-yl]methyl}- 2-(methylsulphonyl) ethanamine of formula (V): wherein R has the same meaning as described in step (b) and X is chosen from the group consisting of Fluorine, Chlorine, Bromine, Iodine, O-Ms (mesylate), O-Ts (tosylate), O-Tf (triflate), ethanesulfonate (esylate), benzenesulfonate (besylate), p-bromobenzenesulfonate (brosylate), p-nitrobenzenesulfonate (nosylate); (c) N-protected Lapatinib of formula (VII): wherein R has the same meaning as described in step (b);(d) N-protected-2-(methylsulphonyl)-N-({5-[4-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran- 2-yloxy)quinazolin-6-yl]furan-2-yl}methyl)ethanamine of formula (III-bis): wherein R has the same meaning as described in step (b); As already mentioned, the preferred compounds from those listed above are those in which R is trifluoroacetyl. Thus the compound 6-[5-({[2-(methylsulphonyl)ethyl]amino}methyl)furan-2-yl]quinazolyn-4-ol sulphate salt of formula (III - H2SO4): is also useful both for the preparation of the compound of formula (IV) and for the preparation of Lapatinib and salts thereof. All five compounds listed above are thus useful for the preparation of Lapatinib of formula (I) and salts thereof. The process of the present invention can allow the preparation of Lapatinib base or conveniently, can allow the preparation of Lapatinib ditosylate and/or Lapatinib ditosylate monohydrate. The starting compound 2-(methylsulphonyl)-N-({5-[4-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yloxy)quinazolin-6-yl]furan-2-yl}methyl)ethanamine of formula (II): is prepared as described in the experimental section. In one embodiment, step (a) in the preparation of the intermediate 6-[5-({[2-(methylsulphonyl)ethyl]amino}methyl)furan-2-yl]quinazolyn-4-ol of formula (III): by means of deprotection of the intermediate 2-(methylsulphonyl)-N-({5-[4-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yloxy) quinazolin-6-yl]furan-2-yl}methyl) ethanamine of formula (II) can be conveniently carried out in an organic solvent such as an alcohol, for example in Methanol, or in acetonitrile and in presence of a reactive acid such as, e.g. sulphuric acid, methanesulphonic acid or para-toluenesulphonic acid. The reaction is carried out at room temperature for at least one hour providing molar yields of around 95%. In one preferred form, the reaction can also be conveniently carried out in the presence of sulphuric acid, in methanol at 40°C. In said case the yield is greater than 95%. The product of formula (III) can be isolated as a base or as a sulphate salt. In the case where the sulphate salt is isolated, the overall yield of this step can also be quantitative. In one preferred embodiment, step (b) can also be carried out using trifluoroacetic anhydride in dimethylformamide as solvent. Triethylamine, which works as a base, is also used and the reaction is typically carried out at 25°C. The typical molar yield for step (b) is between 80% and 92% in the case of starting from the free base of compound (III). In one preferred embodiment, step (c) for conversion of the intermediate of formula (IV) to give the N-protected-N-{[5-(4-substituted-quinazolin-6-yl) furan-2-yl]methyl}-2-(methylsulphonyl)ethanamine of formula (V): in which R has the same meanings as described in step (b) and X is selected in the group consisting of Fluorine, Chlorine, Bromine, Iodine, O-Ms (mesylate), O-Ts (tosylate), O-Tf (triflate), ethanesulfonate (esylate), benzenesulfonate (besylate), p-bromobenzenesulfonate (brosylate), p-nitrobenzenesulfonate (nosylate); is carried out in an organic solvent, typically in toluene, or acetonitrile or dioxane, dioxane and acetonitrile being preferred. The most preferred solvent is dioxane because it allows performing all the following steps avoiding unwanted phase-separations, allowing optimal solubilisation of the reagents and the ability to heat at higher temperatures in comparison to acetonitrile for example. This allows short-time reactions and this is an advantage with reference to the timing of the production cycle. In said step, reagents able to halogenate must be used, such as for example POCl3, SO2Cl, (COCl)2 and PBr3 or by using sulphonyl halides and sulphonic anhydrides such as for example mesylchloride, tosylchloride, tosyl anhydride and triflyc anydride. In one preferred embodiment, step (c) for the preparation of the intermediate of formula (V) in which X is chlorine is carried out in dioxane using phosphorous oxychloride (POCl3) in the presence of a base such as for example triethylamine (TEA). Other chlorinating agents can alternatively be used such as thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride, phosphorous oxychloride being preferred. The reaction is carried out at 80°C. In one preferred embodiment, the product from step (c) is not isolated as a solid but is directly subjected to the reaction of step (d). In one preferred embodiment, step (d) for the preparation of the N-protected Lapatinib of formula (VII): by means of a coupling reaction of the intermediate of formula (V) with 3-chloro-4-[(3-fluorobenzyl)oxy] aniline of formula (VI): can be conveniently carried out in an organic solvent, preferably in a nonpolar solvent such as toluene or in Acetonitrile or, more preferably in Dioxane, being the preferred solvent used in the previous step. The reaction is typically carried out at a temperature comprised between 60°C and 75°C, with a temperature of 60°C being preferred. The reaction duration is approx. one hour. The compound of formula (VII) can be isolated but, according to one preferred embodiment, it is converted in one-pot to Lapatinib, or, even more preferably, it is directly converted to Lapatinib ditosylate or Lapatinib ditosylate monohydrate. Step (e) can be carried out by means of the addition of an aqueous solution of potassium carbonate to the dioxane organic phase containing said intermediate of formula (VII). Maintaining the system at 80-85°C, in the case wherein R is trifluoroacetyl, the reaction is completed in approx. two hours. According to one particularly preferred embodiment of the invention the compound of formula (IV) is converted into Lapatinib ditosylate monohydrate without isolating any intermediates. The examples report the experimental procedure for obtaining Lapatinib ditosylate and its conversion to monohydrate. The molar yield for the entire process, including a further recrystallization step of the monohydrate product, is comprised between 47 and 71%, thus producing at the end a product having high pharmaceutical quality (HPLC Purity >99.90% (A%) with each impurity less than 0.05% (A%)). In one embodiment, the preparation of Lapatinib ditosylate monohydrate can be carried out by first obtaining Lapatinib ditosylate and then subjecting said compound to a hydration reaction in water. Said methods for the preparation of Lapatinib ditosylate monohydrate are known in the literature. The compounds of the present invention having the tetrahydropyranyl group, such as for example the compounds of formula (II) or (III-bis) are highly soluble in organic solvents, thus making them particularly interesting for industrial applications since they allow working in much more concentrated solutions in comparison to the intermediates used in the current industrial synthesis of Lapatinib according to the description in US7,157,466. This offers the possibility of production processes having much lager product batch size. The process of the present invention makes it possible to obtain Lapatinib, and in particular Lapatinib ditosylate monohydrate in high yields, with a synthetic process composed of highly selective and clean reactions, and is easily industrially scalable. Furthermore, according to the preferred aspects it is possible to avoid the isolation of various intermediates making it possible to avoid wasting time due to the drying of the intermediate products and making it possible to perform the entire process in a few synthetic steps with obvious effects on the economy of the entire process. The overall process has high yields. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention step a-bis and step b-bis can be carried out one-pot, i.e. avoiding the isolation of the compound of formula (III-bis). It has been indeed found that performing the step a-bis with an anhydride or an acyl halide the whole process comprising steps a-bis and b-bis can be performed without any other reagent such as for instance a base and avoiding the isolation of the compound (III-bis). In the case in which, e.g. the preferred trifluoroacetic anhydride is employed, no other reagents (except the solvent medium) are necessary. It has been in fact discovered that the acid delivered during the reaction of nitrogen protection in step a-bis is able to promote the cleavage of the tetrahydropiranyl group in the following step b-bis. It has been also observed that while the acetylation reaction is extremely fast and complete already at room temperature, the following removal of the piranyl group requires high temperatures and longer times. Thus, it has been understood that the intermediate of formula (II) is completely converted to the intermediate of formula (III-bis, R=CF3(CO)) before that this intermediate begin to leave his tetrahydropiranyl protection. In other words, no traces intermediate of formula (III) are observed during the combined steps a-bis and b-bis. After the complete formation of intermediate (III-bis), also a different acid, such as sulphoric acid, could be added to facilitate the cleavage of the tetraidropiranyl group, although it is not necessary. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention step a-bis and b-bis are carried out one-pot by means of trifluoroacetic anhydride. The steps a-bis and b-bis can be carried out in presence of an organic solvent such as acetonitrile, dichloromethane, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and dimethylformide, being preferred dimethylformamide and dioxane since they allow to increase the molar yield and purity of the reaction. Furthermore, they allow to reach higher temperature in comparison with other solvents, thus shortening the reaction time. In a preferred embodiment, steps a-bis and b-bis are carried out one-pot with trifluoroacetic anhydride in dioxane. It is convenient to perform steps a-bis and b-bis in absence of water, e.g. with a K.F. value lower than 1000 ppm, since water consumes the acetylating reactant. The acetylation reaction of step a-bis is thus performed at room temperature being instantaneous. The deprotection reaction of step b-bis instead requires high temperature such as 90-95°C and is typically completed in 3 hours. Operating in this way, it is possible to avoid the isolation of the compound of formula (III-bis) and only one reagent is employed to perform both steps with consequent advantage for the economy of the process. According to the process of the present invention, considering also the preferred embodiment of performing one-pot the steps a-bis and b-bis, Lapatinib ditosilate anhydrous is prepared from the compound of formula (II) in just two steps isolating only the compound of formula (IV). The Figure 2 shows the process of synthesis of Lapatinib according a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The molar yield of the whole process starting from the compound of formula (II) is very high since the molar yield of steps a-bis and b-bis carried out one-pot to the compound of formula (IV) is about 90%, the step of conversion one-pot of the compound (IV) to Lapatinib ditosilate anhydrous is about 70% and the conversion of this to Lapatinib ditosilate monohydrate is practically quantitative, thus the overall molar yield is about 60-65%, which is much higher in comparison with the known processes for the preparation of Lapatinib ditosilate monohydrate. This is obviously beneficial for the process and the product from the economic point of view. EXPERIMENTAL PART Example 1 - preparation of the intermediate 6-iodo-4-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yloxy)quinazoline.
