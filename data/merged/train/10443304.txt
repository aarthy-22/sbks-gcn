[Brugada syndrome].
In 1992 we described a new syndrome consisting of syncopal episodes and/or sudden death in patients with a structurally normal heart and a characteristic electrocardiogram displaying a pattern resembling right bundle branch block with an ST segment elevation in leads V1 to V3.
In 1998 it was described that the disease is genetically determined with an autosomal dominant pattern of transmission.
Three different mutations have been identified.
All three mutations affect the structure and the function of the sodium channel SCN5A.
Two mutations result in total loss of function of the sodium channel.
The other mutation results in acceleration of the recovery of the sodium channel from inactivation.
The disease causes 4 to 10 sudden deaths per 10,000 inhabitants per year in areas like Thailand and Laos.
Up to 50% of the yearly sudden deaths in patients with a normal heart might be caused by this syndrome.
The diagnosis is easily made by means of the electrocardiogram (ECG).
The presence of concealed and intermittent forms, however, makes the diagnosis difficult in some patients.
The ECG can be modulated by changes in autonomic balance and the administration of antiarrhythmic drugs.
Beta-adrenergic stimulation normalises the ECG, while i.v.
ajmaline, flecainide or procainamide accentuate the ST segment elevation and are capable of unmasking concealed and intermittent forms of the disease.
The prognosis is poor for patients who do not receive an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.
Antiarrhythmic drugs like amiodarone or beta-blockers do not prevent sudden death in symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals.
