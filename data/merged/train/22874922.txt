Novel non-canonical TGF-β signaling networks: emerging roles in airway smooth muscle phenotype and function.
The airway smooth muscle (ASM) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
ASM cells express a wide range of receptors involved in contraction, growth, matrix protein production and the secretion of cytokines and chemokines.
Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) is one of the major players in determining the structural and functional abnormalities of the ASM in asthma and COPD.
It is increasingly evident that TGF-β functions as a master switch, controlling a network of intracellular and autocrine signaling loops that effect ASM phenotype and function.
In this review, the various elements that participate in non-canonical TGF-β signaling, including MAPK, PI3K, WNT/β-catenin, and Ca(2+), are discussed, focusing on their effect on ASM phenotype and function.
In addition, new aspects of ASM biology and their possible association with non-canonical TGF-β signaling will be discussed.
