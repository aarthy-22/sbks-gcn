Disinfection System FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to the field of disinfection and sterilisation and in particular to the disinfection and/or sterilisation of products, apparatus and instruments, such as surgical or dental equipment, apparatus or tools and to a method of disinfection thereof and further relates to the field of topical therapeutic disinfective treatment of a patient and apparatus therefore. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It is necessary in order to reduce the risk and prevalence of infection resulting from dental or surgical intervention to ensure that dental and surgical instruments are clean and free from bacteria. Common practice in dental and medical surgeries is to sterilise or disinfect dental or surgical tools prior to use by use of an autoclave. Autoclaves, however, are substantial and expensive pieces of equipment requiring an electrical supply and a water supply. Furthermore, whilst they are understood to effectively kill bacteria and other such microorganisms, they are believed to be less effective at dealing with prions and other proteinacious infective agents. Thus, a risk of infection with tainted surgical and dental equipment remains. High level chemical disinfection (e.g. using chlorine or hypochlorite) is also used, as is heat treatment. Ozone is a known disinfectant. It is used as a disinfectant of water supplies and ozonated water is used as a disinfecting fluid. Ozone gas is also used in gaseous ozone disinfection. The use of ozone gas as a disinfecting agent must be carried out with care and with suitable recovery (scavenging) of ozone molecules to prevent its release due to the toxicity of ozone. CN 202844173U describes a device for generating and delivery ozonated water for disinfection of dental instruments chairside. WO-A-2011/038487 illustrates a system and method for sterilising dental and surgical articles by sequential supply to an integral sterilisation chamber of hydrogen peroxide and ozone. In dentistry, ozone gas can be used to disinfect tooth surfaces prior to treatment or to treat caries-producing bacterial in decaying tooth matter. A device for controlled delivery and capture of gaseous ozone to the tooth area may be used. An example of such a device is the Healozone™ marketed by Curozone GmbH. This is described, for example, in WO-A-02/065936. The invention seeks to provide an improved apparatus and technique for the sterilisation or disinfection of products, apparatus and instruments, especially dental and surgical tools and instruments.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The system, container and method of certain aspects of the present invention is intended for sterilizing and/or disinfecting products, articles or instruments. A wide range of products, articles or instruments may be disinfected and/or sterilized using the system/method, such as veterinary apparatus and instruments, surgical apparatus and instruments, dental apparatus and instrument, domestic apparatus and instruments (e.g. for use by children, or in food preparation), commercial food preparation apparatus and instruments, food products, packaged products, food utensils (e.g. knives, forks spoons), etc. Such products, articles or instruments should simply be capable of withstanding the conditions of the treatment. Preferably, the system, contain and method of the invention is for the sterilization and/or disinfecting of dental or surgical instruments and tools and more preferably dental instruments and tools. Dental instruments and tools that may be usefully disinfected/sterilized include probes, retractors, mirrors, syringes, drill pieces, burs, excavators, chisels, burnishers, curettes, spatula, forceps, orthodontic tools and orthodontic appliances, endodontic instruments, and other dental apparatus and instruments. The fluid may be water, e.g. ozonated water. Preferably, however, the invention relates to the use of a sterilizing and/or disinfecting gas composition. Hereinafter, the invention will be described with reference to a sterilizing or disinfecting gas composition in general or to ozone in particular but it should be understood that optionally embodiments may also be included in which the term gas/ozone is replaced by fluid, to include ozonated water, where the context allows. The system comprises a producing device for producing a disinfecting and/or sterilizing gas composition, a treating device for treating, neutralizing or absorbing a residual gas and a sterilization/disinfecting chamber in the form of a container configured for fluid connection with each of the producing device and the treating device. The producing device has a gas outlet, which may be connected by a supply conduit to a container inlet of the container for the supply of a gas composition to the container. The treating device has a gas inlet, which may be connected by a conduit to the container outlet of a container to enable residual gas from the container to be transferred to the treating device for treatment. Preferably, the container is a flexible or collapsible or deformable container. For example, the container may be structured and self-supporting container with a collapsible ability, e.g. a cylindrical container with concertinaed sides, or it may be a container not capable of self-supporting. Preferably the container is a bag. Each of the producing device and the treating device are preferably provided in a housing, preferably the same common housing. Preferably, the container is separate from/external to the housing and is preferably connected by flexible tubing. The supply and treating conduits preferably comprising flexible tubing conduits configured to connect and provide or enable (e.g. via a controllable valve) fluid communication between the conduit and the producing and treating device(s) (i.e. the gas outlet and gas inlet). The supply and treating conduits are preferably configured, along with the container inlet and outlet to provide a hermetically sealed or sealable fluid communicative connection between the supply conduits and the container. The container may be provided with apertures configured for receiving a suitable configured end of a supply conduit. Optionally, the supply and treating conduits are provided in a single tube (containing both tubes for example) to a single port in a container. The container may be of any suitable size or shape depending upon the articles to be disinfected/sterilized. The container should be made of any suitable material, which should preferably not degrade (and should be inert) in the presence of the sterilizing gas composition and residual gas composition at least over the timeframe of a sterilization/disinfection method performed in accordance with the invention. The container should be produced to be robust enough not to readily tear in use, e.g. by provision of thick enough material. Preferably, the container does not contain rubber. The sterilizing gas composition comprises a sterilizing gas or gas mixture and optionally a quantity non-sterilizing gas or gases. By sterilizing gas it is meant any gas that is capable of killing microorganisms such as bacteria when the gas is placed in sustained contact with an instrument harbouring such a microorganism. Preferably the sterilizing gas comprises a quantity of one or each of ozone and hydrogen peroxide. More preferably the sterilizing gas comprises ozone. Optionally, the sterilising gas may comprise a peroxide which may be inserted into the container as a peroxide vapour. Preferably, the gas composition comprises ozone in a concentration of up to about 20%, preferably up to about 10%, more preferably up to about 5%, preferably at least 0.05%>, e.g. in the range 0.5 to 2%, preferably 0.75 to 1.5 (e.g. about 1%). Preferably the ozone has a concentration of at least lppm, more preferably at least 50ppm, still more preferably at least lOOppm and yet more preferably at least 200ppm. Optionally, the ozone concentration is 100 to 500 ppm, e.g. 250 to 350ppm. Preferably, the ozone concentration is provided in an amount of up to 100,000 ppm, e.g. up to 50,000 ppm and more preferably in the range 1000 ppm to 20,000 ppm, still more preferably in the range 5000 ppm to 15,000 ppm, e.g. 8,000 to 12,000 ppm. Optionally ozone is provided in the sterilizing gas composition in an amount of from 1 g/m3, preferably 5 g/m3 to 50 g/m3, preferably 35 g/m3 (e.g. 25- 35). Optionally, the sterilizing gas composition may comprise a quantity of water vapour. In one embodiment, the water vapour derives from the aqueous peroxide solution from which the peroxide gas is generated. Optionally, the sterilizing gas composition may comprise a quantity of air. Optionally, ozone gas and peroxide vapor may be mixed in the container at the same time. The sterilizing gas may include activators and promoters for ozone as are known in the art. By residual gas composition, it is meant gas that is expelled or withdrawn from the container and may include a quantity of sterilizing gas and/or a quantity of partially consumed (e.g. reduced) sterilizing gas. In one embodiment, the system is configured to purge the container with a purge gas. The container may be purged before supply of the sterilizing gas composition to the container, for example to ensure that the container is hermetically sealed and sterilizing gas (such as ozone) is not going to be released to the local environment from the container during use. Optionally the container may be purged with a purge gas after the sterilizing stage and after the residual sterilizing gas has been expelled/withdrawn, in order to ensure that residual traces of the sterilizing gas are captured. The purge gas is preferably oxygen or may optionally be air. Optionally, the purge gas is a reductant gas, especially for use after the sterilization procedure, in order to ensure no residual ozone remains in the container prior to opening. Hereinafter the system and method may be described with reference to ozone as a component of the sterilizing gas composition. When reference to ozone is made and the context allows, it should be understood that sterilizing gas composition or another sterilizing gas may be used. Preferably ozone is generated by the producing device from oxygen in an air supply or oxygen gas from a connected oxygen gas cylinder. The ozone may be generated by any suitable method, e.g. by corona discharge of pure oxygen or oxygen containing gas or by electrochemical generation or by UV ozone generation from oxygen or oxygen containing air. A corona discharge method is preferred. Preferably, the ozone generation is achieved from a cylinder supply of oxygen. Optionally, the ozone generation is achieved from an air supply (e.g. surrounding air) via an inlet to the producing device (and is not produced with an oxygen tank supply). Residual gas comprising unused ozone is expelled from the container after use and delivered to the treating device (e.g. by suction from the treating device) for treatment. The treatment may comprise neutralization, destruction or absorption of residual ozone. Preferably residual ozone is treated by passing through manganese. Preferably the producing device and the treating device is a single apparatus achieving both functions. Examples are known, such as the Healozone™ apparatus. Accordingly, details of the operation of the Healozone, in particular in connection with the ozone generation and ozone treatment which are useful for the present invention and disclosed at www.healozone.de, such details are incorporated herein by reference. In one embodiment, the system further comprises an instrument receptacle for receiving, holding or retaining an instrument for use in the container. The instrument receptacle may comprise an instrument gripping arrangement or an instrument resting surface. The instrument receptacle may form an integral or removably interconnective part of the container or may be a separate component which may be removed from the container for loading and placed into the container for sterilization of the instruments. The instrument receptacle may optionally comprise a tray having a resting surface configured for example with a plurality of elongate protrusions, arranged generally in parallel, upon and across which elongate dental and/or surgical instruments may be placed, whereby the majority of the surface of area of the device is not in contact with the resting surface thereby making it readily available for contact by a sterilizing gas. Optionally, the elongate protrusions are rollers, configured for manual or automatic rotation (e.g. short back and fore rotations) during a sterilization step whereby an instrument resting on the protrusions is caused to move back and forth in a generally longitudinal direction thereby increasing the area of the instrument exposed to sterilizing gas (e.g. the entirety of the surface area). Optionally, the instrument resting surface of the instrument receptacle, e.g. the protrusions, comprises a gas permeable material, such as an open cell gas permeable foam or membrane material, such that a sterilising gas may permeate through the material to make substantive and sterilizing contact with those parts of the instruments resting on the resting surface (e.g. protrusions). In an alternative embodiment, the instrument receptacle may be provided with at least one, preferably at least two pairs of gripping elements, each pair of gripping elements comprising two biased together gripping elements capable of receiving and retaining therebetween a part of an instrument. The gripping elements may be rollers operable in the manner described above and optionally may be formed of a gas permeable material. Optionally, an instrument receptacle comprises a vibrating surface (e.g. battery operated) whereby the instruments are caused to move so as to allow sterilization/disinfecting gas composition to make contact with the entire surface of the articles being sterilized. Optionally, the system further comprises a support for the container upon which the container may be placed, which support optionally is capable of being vibrated to ensure movement of the articles within the container thereby enabling contact by the sterilizing composition on the entire surface of the articles and, in particular to encourage transport of fluid through any lumens and catheters being sterilized. Optionally, post sterilization, the container may be disconnected from the devices, whereby the container inlet and outlets may be sealed (e.g. automatically upon removal of the connectors) According to a preferred embodiment, the container is a bag. The container may comprise a sealable bag comprising a hermetically sealable opening through which instruments (or an instrument receptacle) may be placed in the bag. The bag may be such that the seal may be opened and closed, or it may be a single use bag (e.g. with a heat seal). Optionally a bag may be structured, e.g. with ribs, to maintain one, two or three dimensions of the bag in a pre-determined configuration, especially when provided with an inflating gas. Optionally, the bag is provided with a plurality of elongate protrusions on at least one surface, which optionally are formed by rollers. Optionally the container has a defined structure but is deformable in at least one dimension, e.g. by way of a concertina form of side surfaces of the container whereby it can move from a compact configuration to an extended configuration by purging and extraction of gas, or manually. The container may be of any suitable size or shape. According to a preferred embodiment in which the container may be used, for example, for sterilization/disinfecting of dental apparatus and instruments, the container may be a bag of at least 100 ml volume, optionally up to 5 litres, preferably in the range 200 ml to 2 litres, more preferably 250 ml to 1 litre, still more preferably 400 to 750 ml. The bag of a preferred embodiment may be made of any suitable material, such as silicone (e.g. food grade or medical grade silicone) or polypropylene, PEEK, PVF or PVDF or a multi-layer foil bag (e.g. comprising a polyethylene inner layer, aluminum foil and nylon outer layer). The container is provided with at least one aperture (a connection aperture) for connecting with a conduit to a producing device and a treating device. Optionally a single aperture is provided for both functions (e.g. if the system is configured to provide a single volume of sterilizing gas at any one time, e.g. a bolus of gas), whereby a predetermined volume of sterilizing gas may be provided to the container, where it may be held for a predetermined period and then drawn from the container through the aperture into the treating device (e.g. via a valve between the container and device or within the device). Preferably, two apertures are provided, one for the supply of gas to the container and one for the extraction or expulsion of gas from the container (e.g. enabling a throughflow of gas option). The apertures are preferably configured so as to provide a hermetic seal when not fitted with connecting conduits to the devices. The apertures are preferably configured to be interconnective with a conduit, such as flexible tubing, fitted with an adapter or valve on one end. The adaptor or valve may fit into the aperture to enable flow of gas through the aperture to and/or from respective conduits. The connection apertures of the bag may be provided, for example, with one part of a push-fit connector arrangement (e.g. a female or male part of a male-female push fit connector valve). Alternatively, the connection apertures may be fitted with pierceable septums capable of receiving a supply needle tube provided on the end of a supply conduit. The septum should be configured to form a seal about the supply needle once inserted. The needle in such a connector arrangement should be of sufficient bore to allow the desired flow of sterilising gas composition to and from the container. The flow of gases to and from the container from the supply and treatment devices may be controlled by a controller according to one or a plurality of pre-set or pre-determined programmes or according to individually selected data, or may be manually controlled (e.g. by actuation of corresponding buttons/switches on a control panel). Accordingly, the system may be configurable for various lengths of time and various volumes. The apparatus, chamber, method and composition of certain aspects of the present invention is intended for the application of a therapeutic or disinfecting fluid to a patient treatment site such as a wound, burn or ulcer. The composition according these aspects is preferably a fluid and more preferably a gaseous composition. Preferably, the composition comprises a therapeutic gas. Any therapeutic gas may be used to provide a desired purpose or effect to the treatment site comprising a wound, burn or ulcer. The therapeutic gas may comprise, for example, a gas (or mixture thereof, where compatible) for topical therapy such as xenon (e.g. for anaesthetic treatment or pain relief at the treatment site), nitric oxide (e.g. for wound healing, or burn healing, e.g. with concomitant systemic anti-inflammatory treatment), oxygen (e.g. for wound healing) and ozone (e.g. for disinfection). Preferably, the composition/fluid comprises ozone. The gas composition may optionally be provided to comprise ozone in the concentrations set out above in connection with the earlier aspects, but is preferably 0.05 to 10%, more preferably 0.05 to 5%. The apparatus comprises a producing device for producing a therapeutic or disinfecting fluid composition, a treating device for treating, neutralizing or absorbing a residual gas and a therapeutic or disinfecting chamber configured for fluid connection with each of the producing device and the treating device. The producing device has a fluid outlet, which may be connected by a supply conduit to a chamber inlet of the chamber for the supply of a fluid composition to the chamber. The treating device has a fluid inlet, which may be connected by a conduit to the chamber outlet of a chamber to enable residual fluid from the chamber to be transferred to the treating device for treatment. Preferably, the chamber is provided in the form of a patch, bag or envelope, the patch, bag or envelope configured so as to be placed over a patient treatment site so as to define a treatment space between the patch, bag or envelope and the patient treatment site and configured to form a hermetic seal between the patch, bag or envelope and the patient about the treatment space and the patient treatment site. The chamber should preferably be external to the producing device and treating device. Preferably, the patch, bag or envelope is a flexible or collapsible or deformable article. For example, they may be structured and self-supporting with a collapsible ability. The patch, bag or envelope are preferably provided with an adhesive surface for forming an adhesion or otherwise seal against the skin of a patient (or intermediate surface provided on the skin) so as to define when applied a treatment space about the treatment site. Where the chamber is provided by a bag, an opening in the bag provides an opening through which a limb or protrusion of a patient may be placed inside the bag, and edges defining the opening may be provided with adhesion means for forming a seal with the skin and defining the treatment space (e.g. an adhesive composition provided on the edges or an elastic band provided about the exterior surface of the bag). Where the chamber is provided by a patch, the patch may be defined by peripheral portions not intended to overlie the treatment site, a surface of which peripheral portions may be provided with an adhesive composition to secure the patch against the patient's skin and surround the treatment site to provide a hermetic seal. The seal may optionally be formed by an adhesive means (e.g. adhesive composition), a retention means (e.g. elastic band) or resilient border material which forms a seal on the application of pressure. Insofar as ozone is concerned (and physically insofar as any other therapeutic gas is concerned), the producing and treating devices and tubing conduits may be, where the context allows, as defined in relation to the earlier aspects, any reference to container being a reference to the chamber. In the present aspects, the chamber may be of any suitable size or shape depending upon the location and size of the treatment site and also on the dose level of therapeutic gas desired. Optionally a chamber (e.g. patch, bag or envelope) may be structured, e.g. with ribs, to maintain one, two or three dimensions of the chamber in a pre-determined configuration, especially when provided with an inflating gas. Optionally, the chamber (e.g. patch, bag or envelope) is provided with a plurality of elongate protrusions on at least one surface. Optionally the chamber (e.g. patch, bag or envelope) has a defined structure but is deformable in at least one dimension, e.g. by way of a concertina form of side surfaces of the chamber whereby it can move from a compact configuration to an extended configuration by purging and extraction of gas, or manually. Optionally, the chamber is provided with a retaining structure to retain the wall of the chamber from contact with the patient between the chamber inlet, patient treatment site and chamber outlet to ensure effective supply of therapeutic gas, contact of the gas with the treatment site and removal of the therapeutic gas residue. Optionally the retaining structure is provided as an integral part of the chamber wall (e.g. an integral part of a patch, bag or envelope, e.g. ribbing or the like) or is provided as a separate insert suitable for placing within the treatment space. The chamber may be of any suitable size or shape and is preferably sized to cover the treatment site and to provide a desired volume according to the dose required. According to a preferred embodiment the chamber may define at least 100 ml volume, optionally up to 5 litres, preferably in the range 200 ml to 2 litres, more preferably 250 ml to 1 litre, still more preferably 400 to 750 ml. The patch, bag or envelope (or other chamber wall) should be made of any suitable material, which should preferably not degrade (and should be inert) in the presence of the fluid composition and residual fluid composition at least over the timeframe of a therapeutic method performed in accordance with the invention. It should be produced to be robust enough not to readily tear in use, e.g. by provision of thick enough material. Preferably, the container does not contain rubber. Any suitable material may be used, such as silicone (e.g. food grade or medical grade silicone) or polypropylene, PEEK, PVF or PVDF or a multi-layer foil bag (e.g. comprising a polyethylene inner layer, aluminum foil and nylon outer layer).

Preferably, two apertures are provided, one for the supply of gas to the chamber and one for the extraction or expulsion of gas from the chamber (e.g. enabling a throughflow of gas option). The apertures are preferably configured so as to provide a hermetic seal when not fitted with connecting conduits to the devices. The apertures are preferably configured to be interconnective with a conduit, such as flexible tubing, fitted with an adapter or valve on one end. The adaptor or valve may fit into the aperture to enable flow of gas through the aperture to and/or from respective conduits. The connection apertures of the chamber may be provided, for example, with one part of a push-fit connector arrangement (e.g. a female or male part of a male-female push fit connector valve). Alternatively, the connection apertures may be fitted with pierceable septums capable of receiving a supply needle tube provided on the end of a supply conduit. The septum should be configured to form a seal about the supply needle once inserted.

By residual gas composition, it is meant gas that is expelled or withdrawn from the container and may include a quantity of sterilizing gas and/or a quantity of partially consumed (e.g. reduced) sterilizing gas. In one embodiment, the system is configured to purge the chamber with a purge gas. The chamber may be purged before supply of the gas composition to the chamber, for example to ensure that the chamber is hermetically sealed and therapeutic gas (such as ozone) is not going to be released to the local environment from the chamber during use. Optionally the chamber may be purged with a purge gas after the treatment stage and after the residual gas has been expelled/withdrawn, in order to ensure that residual traces of the therapeutic gas are captured. The purge gas is preferably oxygen or may optionally be air. The ozone production and producing device and residual gas capture and treating device may be as defined above for earlier aspects. The following relates, unless the context determines otherwise, to all aspects. Optionally, a sensor may be provided in the container to communicate when the disinfecting gas has achieved a pre-determined extent of disinfection. For example, a visual sensor may be provided which is configured to provide a colour change when a pre-determined level of reaction with ozone (at a rate configured to correspond with the effect of ozone on common microorganisms) has been achieved. Thereby an endpoint in the sterilization can be identified, improving the sterilization performance of the system. Such a sensor may comprise a strip in an ozone-permeable vial, which strip comprises a biological indicator comprising a biological agent and a vital cell indicator which is capable of demonstrating the presence of vital cells (e.g. upon exposure to a certain wavelength fluorescent light). The ozone producing device and ozone treating device, together forming with the conduits and container/chamber form a closed system for the application and removal and treatment of ozone to a container/chamber as a sterilization/treatment chamber. Together, the ozone and producing and treating devices are formed as a single ozone circulation device. The ozone circulation device preferably comprises: An oxygen supply cylinder/cylinder connector and/or an air inlet An air dryer - A pressure sensor An ozone generator A moisture trap An ozone treatment/neutralizer zone (e.g. manganese bed/filter) - A vacuum pump and optionally a hydrogen peroxide solution supply and vapourising chamber, a peroxide scavenging chamber. The ozone circulation device is preferably portable and preferably lightweight e.g. up to 20 kg, still more preferably up to 12 kg and most preferably up to 10 kg, which more preferably the weights mentioned include the oxygen cylinder. The ozone circulation device is preferably provided with a controller which is optionally configurable to provide programmes of sterilization protocols. Preferably the method and system of the invention for sterilization/disinfecting of a product, article or instrument is configurable to provide any one or more of the following protocols: Protocol 1 : o Continuous flow: o After connection of the supply/treatment conduits to a sealed bag containing an article to be sterilised: ■ Air purge of up to bag volume to bag with outlet closed; hold and pressure sensor (provided in system) determines no leaks ■ Air bolus removed by suction through outlet ■ Continuous supply of humidified ozone gas for period of sterilization ■ Air purge of up to volume of bag followed by suction removal ■ Reductant gas purge of bag followed by suction removal Protocol 2 o Batch sterilization o After connection of the supply/treatment conduits to a sealed bag containing an article to be sterilised: ■ Air purge of up to bag volume to bag with outlet closed; hold and pressure sensor (provided in system) determines no leaks ■ Air bolus removed by suction through outlet ■ Bolus of humidified ozone gas for first sterilization period ■ Bolus of ozone gas removed by suction ■ Bolus of humidified ozone gas for second sterilization period ■ Bolus of ozone gas removed by suction ■ Air purge of up to volume of bag followed by suction removal ■ Reductant gas purge of bag followed by suction removal In each case, other gas compositions may be used in conjunction or in extra steps (e.g. hydrogen peroxide gas, which may be generated by the device or introduced to the bag as a peroxide vapour). The system is preferably configured to be operated by selection of a programme from one or more options. The system is preferably configured to be provided in a case, by way of a kit. The invention will now be described in more detail, without limitation, with reference to the accompanying Figures. In Figure 1, there is shown a system 1 for sterilising/disinfecting an article such as a dental instrument (not shown) the system 1 comprising an ozone circulation device 3 having a housing 5 containing an ozone generating device and an ozone treatment device, the ozone generating device having an air inlet (not shown) and an oxygen cylinder 7 by way of an oxygen supply. Supply tube 9 of silicone supplies an ozone containing sterilising gas composition from supply outlet 11 of the ozone circulation device 3 to gas inlet 13 of flexible/collapsible sterilisation container 15. Dental instruments may be placed into the container 15 via an hermetically sealed opening 17. Residual gas may be drawn from the container 15 via treatment tube 19 connecting gas outlet 21 of the container 15 to treatment inlet 23 of the treatment device in the housing 5, e.g. by a vacuum. To use the system, a sterilisation programme may be selected via the control switches and display 27 after placing articles in the container 15 and sealing the opening 17. The programme may cause a purge gas into the container followed by a sterilising gas composition comprising ozone along supply tube 9 and into the container 15 for a predetermined time which may then be drawn out through treatment tube 19 followed by a purge/reductant gas to remove residual ozone. The tubes 9,19 may be disconnected from inlet and outlet 13,21 and the sterilised article retrieved. The container 15 in Figure 1 is one example of a cylindrical container 15 having rigid ends 29 comprising inlet/outlet ports 13,21 and sealable opening 17 in one end 29. Corrugated flexible collapsible rib elements 31 provide structure to a collapsible side 33. Thus on application of a vacuum, the container may optionally contract to distance allowed by the contained article. In Figure 2, there is illustrated an alternative container 35 in the form of an hermetically sealable bag 35 having a sealable opening 37 with hermetically sealable track system 39 and two inlet/outlet ports 41 for the connection of supply and treatment conduits (not shown) for connection to the ozone generator and residual gas treatment device (not shown). In Figure 3 is an instrument receptacle 43 for resting dental instruments 45 for sterilisation by placing within a sterilisation chamber (not shown, the receptacle 43 comprising a tray surface 47 having two rotatable cylindrical elements 49 disposed above the tray surface and across the receptacle upon which instruments 45 may be placed. The cylindrical elements 49 preferably comprise ozone permeable surfaces (e.g. open celled foam material) and are rotatable about their axes (e.g. mechanical power, such as wind up) so they are caused to rotate successively back and for so as to cause the instruments 45 to move back and fore along the length of the receptacle 43 during sterilisation so as to expose the entire surfaces of the instruments 45 to the sterilisation gas composition. In Figure 4, a patch 50 according to another aspect of the invention is illustrated, the patch comprising a chamber wall 52 defining a chamber and treatment space therein between the patch 50 and a patient site (e.g. harbouring a wound, burn or ulcer) on a patient (in this case a patient's arm) 54. The peripheral border 56 of the patch 50 comprises an adhesive in order to provide a hermetic seal between the patch 50 and the patient's arm 54. The patch wall 54 is provided with two apertures 58 which remain hermetically sealed until fitted with connectors (not shown) of two conduits 60 linking the chamber with a therapeutic gas (typically ozone containing gas) generation and treating device (such as the Healozone™). Therapeutic gas, such as ozone, of a predetermined concentration may be delivered in a predetermined volume into the chamber defined by the patch 50 on the patient's arm via conduits 60 and apertures 58. Ribs 62 may provide some structure to the chamber to enable passage of the therapeutic gas and contact with the treatment site. The gas may be passed over continuously at a predetermined concentration with a pre-determined flow rate for a pre-determined time or a bolus of gas of predetermined concentration and volume may be held in the chamber for a predetermined time to ensure accurate dosage of the gas to the treatment site. The invention has been described with reference to a preferred embodiment. However, it will be appreciated that variations and modifications can be effected by a person of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the scope of the invention. 1.
