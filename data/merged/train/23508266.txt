A genome-wide association study of bronchodilator response in asthmatics.
Reversibility of airway obstruction in response to β2-agonists is highly variable among asthmatics, which is partially attributed to genetic factors.
In a genome-wide association study of acute bronchodilator response (BDR) to inhaled albuterol, 534 290 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested in 403 white trios from the Childhood Asthma Management Program using five statistical models to determine the most robust genetic associations.
The primary replication phase included 1397 polymorphisms in three asthma trials (pooled n=764).
The second replication phase tested 13 SNPs in three additional asthma populations (n=241, n=215 and n=592).
An intergenic SNP on chromosome 10, rs11252394, proximal to several excellent biological candidates, significantly replicated (P=1.98 × 10(-7)) in the primary replication trials.
An intronic SNP (rs6988229) in the collagen (COL22A1) locus also provided strong replication signals (P=8.51 × 10(-6)).
This study applied a robust approach for testing the genetic basis of BDR and identified novel loci associated with this drug response in asthmatics.
