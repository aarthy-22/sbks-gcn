The influence of Goishi tea on adipocytokines in obese mice.
This study investigated the influence of Goishi-tea on visceral fat weight in induced obese mice.
Mice were divided into two main groups, normal and obesity.
In obesity group, mice were fed with high-fat diet.
Goishi-tea including its fractions (ethyl-acetate layer and water layer) was administrated in normal and obesity three sub-groups.
Results showed no influence of Goishi-tea in normal group.
However, visceral fat weight, size of adipose cell and cholesterol level were significantly decreased in obesity group fed Goishi-tea compared to control group.
Moreover, adiponectin levels tended to increase and adipocytokines has significant values lower in obesity group fed Goishi-tea compared to control group.
Interestingly, Goishi tea involved in the high-fat diet induced-obese mice can inhibit fat accumulation and maintain adiponectins without increasing tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6.
It would be beneficial for the prevention of metabolic syndrome and obesity-related disorder.
