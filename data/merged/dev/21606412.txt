Activity of XL184 (Cabozantinib), an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with medullary thyroid cancer.
PURPOSE: XL184 (cabozantinib) is a potent inhibitor of MET, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), and RET, with robust antiangiogenic, antitumor, and anti-invasive effects in preclinical models.
Early observations of clinical benefit in a phase I study of cabozantinib, which included patients with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), led to expansion of an MTC-enriched cohort, which is the focus of this article.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A phase I dose-escalation study of oral cabozantinib was conducted in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Primary end points included evaluation of safety, pharmacokinetics, and maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) determination.
Additional end points included RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) response, pharmacodynamics, RET mutational status, and biomarker analyses.
RESULTS: Eighty-five patients were enrolled, including 37 with MTC.
The MTD was 175 mg daily.
Dose-limiting toxicities were grade 3 palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), mucositis, and AST, ALT, and lipase elevations and grade 2 mucositis that resulted in dose interruption and reduction.
Ten (29%) of 35 patients with MTC with measurable disease had a confirmed partial response.
Overall, 18 patients experienced tumor shrinkage of 30% or more, including 17 (49%) of 35 patients with MTC with measurable disease.
Additionally, 15 (41%) of 37 patients with MTC had stable disease (SD) for at least 6 months, resulting in SD for 6 months or longer or confirmed partial response in 68% of patients with MTC.
CONCLUSION: Cabozantinib has an acceptable safety profile and is active in MTC.
Cabozantinib may provide clinical benefit by simultaneously targeting multiple pathways of importance in MTC, including MET, VEGFR2, and RET.
A global phase III pivotal study in MTC is ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00215605).
