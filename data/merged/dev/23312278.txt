Tipping the energy balance toward longevity.
AMPK is a cellular energy sensor conserved across eukaryotes that in C. elegans prolongs life span and mimics dietary restriction.
Stenesen and colleagues (2012) activate AMPK both directly and indirectly by altering AMP biosynthesis to slow aging in Drosophila, highlighting AMPK as a conserved life span modulator that links energy sensing to longevity.
