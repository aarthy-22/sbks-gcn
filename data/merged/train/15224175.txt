5-HT1B receptors, alpha2A/2C- and, to a lesser extent, alpha1-adrenoceptors mediate the external carotid vasoconstriction to ergotamine in vagosympathectomised dogs.
It has previously been suggested that ergotamine produces external carotid vasoconstriction in vagosympathectomised dogs via 5-HT1B/1D receptors and alpha2-adrenoceptors.
The present study has reanalysed this suggestion by using more selective antagonists alone and in combination.
Fifty-two anaesthetised dogs were prepared for ultrasonic measurements of external carotid blood flow.
The animals were divided into thirteen groups (n=4 each) receiving an i.v.
bolus injection of, either physiological saline (0.3 ml/kg; control), or the antagonists SB224289 (300 microg/kg; 5-HT1B), BRL15572 (300 microg/kg; 5-HT1D), rauwolscine (300 microg/kg; alpha2), SB224289 + BRL15572 (300 microg/kg each), SB224289 + rauwolscine (300 microg/kg each), BRL15572 + rauwolscine (300 microg/kg each), rauwolscine (300 microg/kg) + prazosin (100 microg/kg; alpha1), SB224289 (300 microg/kg) + prazosin (100 microg/kg), SB224289 (300 microg/kg) + rauwolscine (300 microg/kg) + prazosin (100 microg/kg), SB224289 (300 microg/kg) + prazosin (100 microg/kg) + BRL44408 (1,000 microg/kg; alpha2A), SB224289 (300 microg/kg) + prazosin (100 microg/kg)+ imiloxan (1,000 microg/kg; alpha2B), or SB224289 (300 microg/kg) + prazosin (100 microg/kg) + MK912 (300 microg/kg; alpha2C).
Each group received consecutive 1-min intracarotid infusions of ergotamine (0.56, 1, 1.8, 3.1, 5.6, 10 and 18 microg/min), following a cumulative schedule.
In saline-pretreated animals, ergotamine induced dose-dependent decreases in external carotid blood flow without affecting arterial blood pressure or heart rate.
These control responses were: unaffected by SB224289, BRL15572, rauwolscine or the combinations of SB224289 + BRL15572, BRL15572 + rauwolscine, rauwolscine + prazosin, SB224289 + prazosin, or SB224289 + prazosin + imiloxan; slightly blocked by SB224289 + rauwolscine; and markedly blocked by SB224289 + rauwolscine + prazosin, SB224289 + prazosin + BRL44408 or SB224289 + prazosin + MK912.
Thus, the cranio-selective vasoconstriction elicited by ergotamine in dogs is predominantly mediated by 5-HT1B receptors as well as alpha2A/2C-adrenoceptor subtypes and, to a lesser extent, by alpha1-adrenoceptors.
