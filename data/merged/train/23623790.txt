GABAA receptor modulation by piperine and a non-TRPV1 activating derivative.
The action of piperine (the pungent component of pepper) and its derivative SCT-66 ((2E,4E)-5-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl))-N,N-diisobutyl-2,4-pentadienamide) on different gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A (GABAA) receptors, transient-receptor-potential-vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) receptors and behavioral effects were investigated.
GABAA receptor subtypes and TRPV1 receptors were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes.
Modulation of GABA-induced chloride currents (IGABA) by piperine and SCT-66 and activation of TRPV1 was studied using the two-microelectrode-voltage-clamp technique and fast perfusion.
Their effects on explorative behavior, thermoregulation and seizure threshold were analyzed in mice.
Piperine acted with similar potency on all GABAA receptor subtypes (EC50 range: 42.8±7.6μM (α2β2)-59.6±12.3μM (α3β2)).
IGABA modulation by piperine did not require the presence of a γ2S-subunit, suggesting a binding site involving only α and β subunits.
IGABA activation was slightly more efficacious on receptors formed from β2/3 subunits (maximal IGABA stimulation through α1β3 receptors: 332±64% and α1β2: 271±36% vs. α1β1: 171±22%, p<0.05) and α3-subunits (α3β2: 375±51% vs. α5β2:136±22%, p<0.05).
Replacing the piperidine ring by a N-di-isobutyl residue (SCT-66) prevents interactions with TRPV1 and simultaneously increases the potency and efficiency of GABAA receptor modulation.
SCT-66 displayed greater efficacy on GABAA receptors than piperine, with different subunit-dependence.
Both compounds induced anxiolytic, anticonvulsant effects and reduced locomotor activity; however, SCT-66 induced stronger anxiolysis without decreasing body temperature and without the proconvulsive effects of TRPV1 activation and thus may serve as a scaffold for the development of novel GABAA receptor modulators.
