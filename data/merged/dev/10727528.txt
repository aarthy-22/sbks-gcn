Aspirin and sodium salicylate inhibit endothelin ETA receptors by an allosteric type of mechanism.
Aspirin is a commonly used drug with a wide pharmacological spectrum including antiplatelet, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective actions.
This study shows that aspirin and sodium salicylate, its major blood metabolite, reverse contractile actions of endothelin-1 (ET-1) in isolated rat aorta and human mammary arteries.
They also prevent the intracellular Ca(2+) mobilizing action of ET-1 in cultured endothelial cells but not those of neuromedin B or UTP.
Inhibition of the actions of ET-1 by salicylates is apparently competitive.
Salicylates inhibit (125)I-ET-1 binding to recombinant rat ETA receptors.
Salicylic acid promotes dissociation of (125)I-ET-1 ETA receptor complexes both in the absence and the presence of unlabeled ET-1.
It has no influence on the rate of association of (125)I-ET-1 to ETA receptors.
Salicylates do not promote dissociation of (125)I-ET-1 ETB receptor complexes.
Salicylates potentiate relaxing actions of receptor antagonists such as bosentan.
It is concluded that salicylates are allosteric inhibitors of ETA receptors.
The results also suggest that: 1) irreversible ET-1 binding probably limits actions of receptor antagonists in vivo, and 2) an association of salicylates and ETA receptor antagonists should be used to evaluate the physiopathological role of ET-1 and may be of therapeutic interest in the treatment of ischemic heart disease.
