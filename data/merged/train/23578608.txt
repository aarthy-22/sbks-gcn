Role of plant stanol derivatives in the modulation of cholesterol metabolism and liver gene expression in mice.
The present study was to evaluate the cholesterol-lowering effect of two novel plant stanol derivatives and its potential molecular mechanism in hyper-cholesterol mice induced by a high-cholesterol diet.
Results showed that oral administration of plant stanyl hemisuccinate (2×, 5×) and plant stanyl sorbitol succinate (2×, 5×) effectively attenuated the serum total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, while had no effect on the serum triacylglycerol and high density lipoprotein cholesterol. And plant stanol derivatives decreased liver cholesterol concentration and increased faecal cholesterol output.
Meanwhile, both plant stanyl hemisuccinate and plant stanyl sorbitol succinate could remarkably promote liver X receptor alpha (LXRα) expression, and increased cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) expression and faecal total bile acid output to varying degrees.
These results suggested two novel plant stanol derivatives possessed hypocholesterolemic effect, and the cholesterol-lowering action of plant stanol derivatives may be through activating the potential LXRα-CYP7A1-bile acid excretion pathway.
