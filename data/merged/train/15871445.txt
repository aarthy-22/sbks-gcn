Tolerability of selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor, celecoxib, in patients with analgesic intolerance.
Intolerance reactions to acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are common and caused by inhibition of COX-1 enzyme.
Therefore, drugs that selectively inhibit COX-2 enzyme may be safe in these subjects.
In this study, we evaluated the tolerability of celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, in patients with analgesic intolerance.
The eligible study population consisted of patients with a history of urticaria/angioedema, naso-ocular symptoms, bronchospasm, and/or anaphylactoid reaction induced by ASA and/or NSAIDs.
A single-blind, placebo-controlled oral challenge test was performed in the hospital setting.
On 2 separate days, 1/4 and 3/4 divided doses of placebo and celecoxib (Celebrex 200 mg, Pfizer, Turkey) were given with 2-hour intervals.
Seventy-five subjects (mean age: 38.2 +/- 1.4 years; F:M: 55:20) were included in the study.
Twenty-one subjects had asthma.
No reaction was observed with placebo or celecoxib provocation.
Although celecoxib seems to be a safe alternative drug in our study group, considering its serious adverse events reported in the literature, the drug should be recommended for patients with analgesic intolerance only after being tested by an experienced allergist.
