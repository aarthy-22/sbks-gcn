RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to Taiwan Application Serial Number 103115550, filed Apr. 30, 2014, which is herein incorporated by reference. BACKGROUND 1. Field of Invention The present invention relates to a photosensitive resin composition for a color filter of a liquid crystal display (LCD) and a color filter produced by using the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to a photosensitive resin composition for a color filter with excellent linearity of a finer pattern and resistance to an alkaline solution. 2. Description of Related Art At present, a color filter has been widely used in the application fields of a color liquid crystal display (LCD), a color fax machine, a color video camera and the like. With the increasing market requirements of office equipments such as the color LCD and the like, the method of producing the color filter is tended to be diverse, and methods such as a dyeing method, a printing method, an electrodeposition method, a dispersing method and the like have been developed. Now, the dispersing method is the major technique for producing the color filter. In the aforementioned dispersing method, the pigment is dispersed in the photosensitive resin composition. Then, the photosensitive resin is coated on a glass substrate, followed by being exposed, developed and obtaining a specific pattern. Next, the aforementioned coating, exposing, and developing steps are repeated in three times, resulting in the desired red (R), green (G) and blue (B) pixel color patterns in the pixel color layer of the color filter. Typically, for further improving the contrast of the color filter, a light-shielding layer (or called a black matrix) is disposed between the pixel color layers that are formed by pixels. In the process of the dispersing method, examples for the alkali-soluble resin of the photosensitive resin composition can be a copolymer polymerized by (meth)acrylic acid as a monomer component. The aforementioned photosensitive resin composition can be referred to related references of Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publications JP H06-95211, JP H08-183819, JP H09-311210 and so on. However, with minimization and lightweight of a personal digital assistant and a digital camera in recent years, the color filter must be much thinner and higher color saturation. Thus, it's needed to increase the concentration of the colorant of the photosensitive resin composition. When the concentration of the colorant is increased, the amount of the resin in the photosensitive resin is reduced relatively. When the amount of the adhesive resin is reduced, the adhesives between the pixel and the shielding layer is reduced and the pixel is easily peeled off, resulting in destructing the linearity of the finer pattern. Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2001-075273 discloses a photosensitive resin composition. The polymer, which is copolymerized by a unsaturated monomer having a carboxylic group and a monomer having an epoxy group, serves as the alkali-soluble resin of the photosensitive resin, for improving the aforementioned problems of the linearity of the finer pattern. However, such photosensitive resin composition has defects of bad resistance to an alkaline solution. Therefore, there is a need to improve the problems of the bad linearity of the finer pattern of the photosensitive resin and the bad resistance to an alkaline solution simultaneously, which are also the issues being solved urgently by the skilled person in this art, so as to meet the requirements of the industry field. SUMMARY Therefore, an aspect of the present invention provides a photosensitive resin composition for a color filter.

Method of Producing Color Filter The present invention also provides a method of producing a color filter, which uses the aforementioned photosensitive resin composition of the color filter to form a pixel layer, hereinafter as a pixel color layer. The present invention also provides a color filter, which is produced by the aforementioned producing method. The method of producing the color filter sequentially includes a step of producing a photosensitive layer formed by the photosensitive resin composition of the color filter, a step of exposing the photosensitive layer to cure an exposed area, a step of removing a unexposed area with an alkaline developing solution to form the pattern, a step of recurring the pattern to form a pixel color layer, a step of sputtering an ITO protective film and so on. In the aforementioned step of producing a photosensitive layer, the aforementioned solution state of the photosensitive resin composition can be coated on a substrate by various coating methods such as spin-coating, cast coating, roll coating or the like. The aforementioned substrate can be alkali-free glass, Na—Ca glass, hard glass (Pyrex glass), a quartz glass, those having an electrically conductive transparent film disposed thereon or a substrate (for example, silicone substrate) used in light-to-electricity conversion (for example, solid-camera device). In addition, before the photosensitive resin composition is coated on the substrate, the black matrix for separating the pixel color layer of red, green, blue and the like has been formed on the substrate. After the coating process, most organic solvent in the photosensitive resin composition is removed by the drying process under reduced pressure. Then, the remaining organic solvent can be completely removed by the pre-baking process so as to form a pre-baked and coated film. The drying process under reduced pressure is carried out in various conditions. Typically, the drying process under reduced pressure is performed under 0 to 200 torr for 1 to 60 seconds depending upon the kinds and the mixing ratio of the compounds. The pre-baking process is typically performed under 70° C. to 110° C. for 1 to 15 minutes. In the aforementioned exposure step, the pre-baked and coated film is exposed under a mask having specific patterns. The exposure light is preferably UV light such as g-line, h-line, i-line and so on, which may be generated by a UV illumination device such as (super) high-pressure mercury lamp or metal halide lamp. In the aforementioned step of developing, the pre-baked and coated film is immersed in a developing solution under 21° C. to 25° C. for 15 seconds to 5 minutes, thereby remove undesired portions of the exposed pre-baked and coated film and forming a semi-finished product having a pixel color layer with a given pattern. The aforementioned developing solution can be alkaline solution such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, sodium silicate, sodium methyl silicate, ammonia solution, ethylamine, diethylamine, dimethylethylanolamine, tetramethylammonium hydroxide, tetraethylammonium hydroxide, choline, pyrrole, piperidine, 1,8-diazabicyclo-[5,4,0]-7-undecene or the like. The concentration of the developing solution is 0.001 weight percent (wt. %) to 10 wt. %, preferably 0.005 wt. % to 5 wt. %, and more preferably 0.01 wt. % to 1 wt. %. In the aforementioned recurring step, the substrate (having the semi-finished product of the pixel color layer having the given pattern disposed thereon) is washed by water to remove undesired portions of the exposed, pre-baked and coated film. The semi-finished product having the pixel color layer with the given pattern is dried by using compressed air or nitrogen gas. Then, the semi-finished product having the pixel color layer with the given pattern is subjected to a post-bake treatment with a heating device such as a hot plate or an oven. The post-bake treatment can be carried out under 150° C. to 250° C. for 5 to 60 minutes on the hot plate or for 15 to 150 minutes in the oven, thereby curing the semi-finished product having the pixel color layer with the given pattern and forming a pixel color layer. The pixel color layers of red, green, blue and the like can be formed sequentially on the substrate by repeating the aforementioned steps. In the aforementioned step of sputtering the ITO protective film, the ITO protective film is sputtered on the surface of the pixel color layer under 220° C. to 250° C. under vacuum environment. The ITO protective film is etched and wired if necessary, and then a liquid crystal (LC) alignment film is coated on the surface of the ITO protective film so as to produce the color filter with the pixel layer. Method of Producing Liquid Crystal Display The present invention also provides a LCD, which includes the aforementioned color filter. The color fitter and a substrate that has thin film transistor (TFT) are oppositely disposed. A cell gap is firstly interposed between the aforementioned two substrates. Next, the surrounding of the color filter and the substrate is sealed by an adhesive, and a gap-hole is left. Then, liquid crystal (LC) is injected from the gap-hole into a space defined by a surface of the substrate and the adhesive, and the gap-hole is sealed to form a LC layer. And then, a polarized plate is adhered on a side that does not contact the LC layer of the color filter and on another side that does not contact the LC layer of the substrate, so as to fabricate the LCD device. The aforementioned LC can be a LC compound or a LC composition without specific limitations. Moreover, the alignment film of the color filter is used to control the alignment of the LC molecule. The alignment film can be inorganic compounds or organic compounds without specific limitations to the aforementioned examples in the present invention. Hereinafter, several embodiments are described below to illustrate the application of the present invention. However, these embodiments are not used for limiting the present invention. For those skilled in the art of the present invention, various variations and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
