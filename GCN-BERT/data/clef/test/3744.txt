Technical Field The present invention relates to a novel nicotine related insecticide, and the preparation methods and applications thereof. In particular, the present invention relates to nitromethylene analogues of imidacloprid and divalent and oxabridged heterocyclic nicotine related compounds (or neonicotinoid compounds) constructed by dialdehydes, and the preparation methods thereof. Background Art Novel nicotine related pesticides, as represented by Imidacloprid, have high insecticidal activity, a broad insecticidal spectrum, and low toxicity for mammals and aquatic animals, favorable systematic properties and suitable in-field stability as well as environmental friendliness; therefore, have become an important hot spot area for new agrochemical discovery. Subsequently, a series of nicotine related insecticides, such as thiacloprid, clothianidin, thiamethoxam, acetamiprid, nitenpyram, and dinotefuran have been discovered in succession (see European Patents 247477, 296453, 685477, 235725, 235725, 315826, 192060, 244777, 0386565, 580553, and 1031556, and Japanese Patents 62292765, 8259568, 8291171, and 7242633). However, because the frequent and excessive use of imidacloprid has caused serious problems of resistance and the structural similarity of nicotine related has brought on cross-resistance thereamong, the application of this class of compounds has been restricted to a certain extent and the development of new compounds of this class is constrained. Meanwhile, nicotine related compounds are primarily insecticidal against homopterans and coleopterans, and its relatively narrow insecticidal spectrum has also restricted the application thereof in the pest control. Therefore, it is urgent in the art to structurally modify nitromethylene compounds with high activity for producing a new, even more effective insecticide, resolving the resistance problems of nicotine related insecticides, enlarging the insecticidal spectrum, and applying the same to insecticidal compositions. Disclosure of the Invention The present invention provides a new, more effective insecticide, thereby resolving the resistance problems of nicotine related insecticides, enlarging the insecticidal spectrum, and resolving the problems existed in the art. One objective of the present invention is to provide a compound that is highly effective in pest control, and the preparation method thereof. Another objective of the present invention is to provide protection for preventing crops during the period of growth and harvest from being attacked and invaded by insects. In one aspect, the present invention provides an oxabridged heterocyclic nicotine related compoundas defined in claim 1. In another aspect, the present invention provides an agrochemical composition, which comprises: (a) 0.001 to 99.99 wt% of the aforesaid oxabridged heterocyclic nicotine related compound, an agrochemically acceptable salt thereof, or a combination thereof; and(b) an agrochemically acceptable carrier and/or excipient. In another aspect, the present invention relates to the use of said agrichemical composition in exterminating or preventing agricultural pests, sanitary pests, and pests endangering the health of animals; or as an insecticidal composition for exterminating or preventing agricultural pests, sanitary pests, and pests endangering the health of animals. In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for exterminating and/or preventing pest, the method comprising applying said agrichemical composition to plants suffering or likely suffering from pests, and to the surrounding soil or environment thereof. In another aspect, the present invention relates to the use of said compound, agrochemically acceptable salt thereof, or combination thereof in preparing an insecticidal composition. In yet another aspect, the present invention provides a method for preparing said compound, or agrochemically acceptable salt thereof, the method comprising the following step: obtaining the compound of Formula (1c) by conducting the following reaction for 2 to 24 hours in acetonitrile at room temperature in the presence of a catalytic amount of acid; obtaining the compound of Formula (1d) by conducting the following reaction for 2 to 24 hours in acetonitrile at room temperature in the presence of a catalytic amount of acid; obtaining the compound of Formula (2c) by conducting the following reaction for 2 to 24 hours in acetonitrile at room temperature in the presence of a catalytic amount of acid; obtaining the compound of Formula (2d) by conducting the following reaction for 2 to 24 hours in acetonitrile at room temperature in the presence of a catalytic amount of acid; Specific Embodiments Through extensive and intensive research,based on the imidacloprid nitromethylene structure of existing imidacloprid nitromethylene nicotine related insecticides, the inventors of the present invention have, by reacting a dialdehyde with an imidacloprid nitromethylene compound, synthesized a novel nicotine related compound, which has a markedly improved insecticidal activity and possesses a broader insecticidal spectrum.

Insecticidal Compositions Containing the Active Substance of the Present Invention A conventional method can be used to prepare an insecticidal composition from the active substances of the present invention. Such active compounds can be made into a conventional fomulation, such as solutions, emulsions, suspensions, powders, foams, pastes, or granules; aerosols; natural or synthetic materials impregnated with the active substance, microcapsules in a polymer, a coating complex used for seeds; a preparation to be used together with a combustion device, such as a fumigant cartridge, fumigant jar or fumigant plate, and ULV cold mist and warm mist preparations. These folmulation can be produced using a known method,for example, mixing the active compound(s) and extenders, wherein the extenders are a diluent or carrier in the form of a liquid, a liquefied gas, or a solid, optionally with a surfactant, i.e. an emulsifying agent and/or a dispersion agent and/or a foam forming agent. For example, when water is used as an extender, an organic solvent can also be used as auxiliary solvents. It is generally proper to use liquid solvents as a diluent or carrier, for example: aromatic hydrocarbons, such as xylene, toluene, or alkylnaphthalenes; chlorinated aromatic or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzene, vinyl chloride, or dichloromethane; aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane or a paraffin such as a mineral oil fraction; alcohols, such as ethanol, ethylene glycol, and the ethers and esters thereof; or ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, or cyclohexanone; or polar solvents used less commonly, such as dimethyl formamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, and water. A diluent or carrier in the form of a liquefied gas refers to a liquid which are gaseous at normal temperature and under atmospheric pressure, for example, aerosol propellants, such as halogenated hydrocarbons as well as butane, propane, nitrogen gas, and carbon dioxide. Solid carriers include ground natural minerals, such as: Kaolin, clay, talc, quartz, activated clay, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth; or ground synthetic minerals, such as highly dispersed silicic acid, alumina, and silicates. A solid carrier used for granules is crushed and graded natural zircon, such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite, and dolomite, as well as granules synthesized from inorganic or organic coarse powder, and organic materials such as granules from sawdust, coconut shells, corn cobs, or tobacco stems, and the like. Non-ionic or anionic emulsifiers can be used as emulsifying and/or foam-forming agents. Examples include: polyoxyethylene - fatty acid esters and polyoxyethylene - fatty alcohol ethers, such as alkyl aryl polyethylene glycol ethers, alkyl sulfonic acid esters, alkyl sulfuric acid esters, aryl sulfonic acid esters, and albumin hydrolysis products. Dispersion agents include, for example, lignin-sulfite waste and methyl cellulose. In the formulations, it is possible to use an adhesive, such as carboxymethyl cellulose and a natural or synthetic polymer(e.g., gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol, and polyvinylacetate), in the form of powders, granules, or emulsions. A coloring agent can also be used, such as an inorganic dye, (e.g., iron oxide, cobalt oxide, or Prussian blue); or an organic dye, (such as an azo dye or a metal phthalocyanine dye); and a trace nutrient, such as the salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, aluminum and zinc, and the like. These active compounds of the present invention may, together with other active compounds, be made into a mixture present in a commercial formulation or a dosage form prepared from the commercial formulation; said other active compounds include, but are not limited to, insecticides, bait, bactericide , acaricides, nematocides, fungicides, growth control agents, and the like. Insecticides comprise, for example, phosphate esters, carbamic esters, pyrethrum ester, chlorinated hydrocarbons, benzoylurea, nereistoxins, and substances produced by microorganisms, such as abamectin. In addition, these active compounds of the present invention may also, together with a synergist, be made into a mixture present in a commercial formulation or a dosage form prepared from these commercial formulations. Synergist is a compound that enhances the effects of the active compounds; the synergist is not necessary, since the active compounds are inherently active. Generally, the formulations contain 0.001 to 99.99 wt% of the active compounds of the present invention, preferably 0.01 to 99.9 wt%, more preferably 0.05 to 90 wt%, by the weight of said insecticidal composition. The concentration of active compounds in a dosage form prepared from a commercial formulation may be varied within a broad range. The concentration of active compounds in a dosage form can be between 0.0000001 to 100% (g/v), preferably between 0.0001 and 1%.

It should be understood that these examples are merely to illustrate the present invention, but not to limit the scope of the present invention. The experimental methods with no specific conditions described in the following examples are generally performed under conventional conditions, or according to the manufacturer's instruction. Unless otherwise specified, percentages and parts are calculated by weight. Herein, "r.t." stands for room temperature.

Example 11: Measuring the insecticidal activity of the compounds of the present invention (1) Insecticidal activity against aphids Aphids, which belong to the Homoptera and have piercing-sucking mouth parts, are a common pest for agricultural crops. Aphis craccivora was used as the subject, and a dipping method was employed for testing. Testing method: Each sample was precisely weighed, and 2 mL of DMSO and 18 mL of water were added respectively; then, three drops of the emulsion agent 200I were added to form a testing liquid; a blank was also prepared by adding three drops of emulsion agent 220I to 2 mL of DMSO and 18 mL of water. Broad bean leaves adhered by a certain number of insects were immersed in the testing liquid for three to five seconds, then removed and air-dried; the insects were moved into a clean container together with feed, and the container was placed in a dry, thermostatic recovery room. After 24 hours, the number of dead insects was checked. The results are shown in Table 1. (2) Insecticidal activity against Nilaparvata lugens Nilaparvata lugens, which belongs to the Homoptera and has piercing-sucking mouth parts, is a common pest for agricultural crops. Nilaparvata lugens was used as the subject, and the micro-drip measurement method reported by Nagata was employed for testing. Operation procedure: Unmated winged females two to three days after eclosion were selected as the test subjects; the compounds were diluted in acetone to a series of concentrations. The insects were paralyzed by carbon dioxide, and the liquid (0.08 µL) was dripped onto the pronotum of the insects using a manual micro-dripper (Burkard Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Rickmansworth, UK). Each of the concentrations was used to treat about 30 insects in triplicate. Acetone was used as the control. The treated adult insects were cultured on rice seedlings grown without soil in an incubator (20 x 20 x 10 cm), where the temperature was controlled at 25±1°C with 16/8 hours of light and dark cycle. The results were checked after 48 hours, and the LD50 was calculated using a standard probability analysis method. The results are shown in Table 2. (3) Insecticidal activity against armyworms Second instar Pseudaletia separata Walker larvae were used as the subjects and the dipping method was employed for testing. Pseudaletia separata Walker, which is a very important lepidopterans pest of various grains, can be suitably used in various of applications, for example, in the study of toxicity, such as the stomach toxicity, contact poisoning, comprehensive and residual effects of insecticides, and other aspects of insect toxicology, as well as the screen test for new compounds. Pseudaletia separata Walker extermination activity was tested in accordance with a method reported in the literature. Operation procedure of the leaf-dipping method: Each sample was precisely weighed, and 2 mL of DMSO and 18 mL of water were added respectively;and then, three drops of the emulsion agent 200I (procured from Shanghai Nongyaochang Co., Ltd.) were added to form the test liquid. A blank was also formulated by adding three drops of the 220I emulsion agent to 2 mL of DMSO and 28 mL of water. Fresh corn leaves were torn into small pieces and immersed for about five seconds in the liquid, then removed, air-dried, and placed in a 100-mL jar. About 20 2nd instar larvae were introduced into the jar. The jar was closed using white gauze and a rubber band, and the larvae were fed with corn soaked with the liquid continuously. The mortality rate of the larvae was checked after five days. The requisite temperature was 22°C to 27°C, humidity 70% to 80%. There was no need to correct the mortality rates for each treatment if the blank mortality rate was 5% or less; however, if the control mortality rate was 5% to 20%, Abbott's correction should be used for the mortality rates for each treatment. Abbott's formula: Corrected mortality rate=treated mortality rate-control mortality rate/100-control mortality rate×100.Table 1: Insecticidal activities of target compounds against aphids and Pseudaletia separata WalkerCompoundAphis craccivoraPseudaletia separata WalkerMortality rate (%, 500 mg L-1)LC50 (mmol L-1)Mortality rate (%, 500 mg L-1)LC50 (mmol L-1)8a1001.5210012.58b100n.t.100n.t.8c13.6n.t.0n.t.8d95.7n.t.0n.t.9a87.3n.t.0n.t.9b98.2n.t.0n.t.9c55.6n.t.0n.t.9d38.9n.t.0n.t.Imidacloprid1008.9310038.7Table 2: Activities of compounds against susceptible and resistant Niloparvata lugensStrainCompoundToxicity curveLD50 (ng / pestRelative toxicityMagnitude of resistanceSusceptible strain8ay = 7.3127 + 2.0474x0.0742±0.01061.771.009ay = 3.9543 + 1.6936x4.1440±0.613E0.321.00Imidaclopridy=7.1823+ 2.4778x0.1316±0.01541.001.00Resistant strain8ay = 5.4068 + 1.3225x0.4925±0.081150.006.649ay = 3.1320 + 1.4613x18.9795±2.3501.174.58Imidaclopridy = 2.5873 + 1.7930x22.1614±3.7521.00168.40 The activities of the target compounds on aphids, Pseudaletia separata Walker, and Niloparvata lugens were tested, and the results are shown in Tables 1 and 2 (in these tables, compounds 8a-8d and 9a-9d correspond respectively to compounds 1 a-1 d and 2a-2d). It can be seen from Tables 1 and 2 that the oxabridged heterocyclic compound 1a possesses very high activity which is much higher than that of imidacloprid: LC50 against aphids is 1.52 mg L-1, and LC50 against Pseudaletia separata Walker is 12.5 mg L-1. Even more importantly, the activity of the compound 1a against susceptible Niloparvata lugens is generally the same as imidacloprid, and the activity thereof against imidacloprid-resistant Niloparvata lugens is 50 times that of imidacloprid. Compound 1a has relatively weak activity. Interestingly, the activities of the oxabridged heterocyclic compounds 2a to 2c, which are constructed from glutaraldehyde, were much weaker, and some compounds were effective only against aphids. An analysis of the crystalline structures of the compounds 1a and 2a shows that the compounds 1a and 2a have different oxabridged configurations, where oxabridges are opposite in orientation; this difference can be very clearly observed by superimposing the two molecules. This difference in the oxabridged structures may be responsible for the markedly different activities of the compounds 1a and 2a. Example 12: Research of the mechanism of action of the reference compound (1a) The compound (1a) was separately subjected to electrophysiological testing and isotope marker substitution testing. Compound (1a) can inhibit agonist response, compound (1a) has no agonistic action on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of Periplaneta americana nor on the N1 α 1/β 2 receptors expressed by the oocytes, and compound (1a) can inhibit the agonist response to acetylcholine. These experiments demonstrate that the compound is an antagonist of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChRs).
