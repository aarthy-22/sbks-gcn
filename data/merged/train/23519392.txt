Pregnane X Receptor Mediates Dyslipidemia Induced by the HIV Protease Inhibitor Amprenavir in Mice.
HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) have been used successfully in extending the lifespan of people infected with HIV.
The use of PIs has also been associated with dyslipidemia and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive.
Several PIs have been implicated to activate the nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor (PXR), which acts as a xenobiotic sensor to regulate xenobiotic metabolism in the liver and intestine.
Recent studies indicate that PXR may also play an important role in the regulation of lipid homeostasis.
In the present study, we identified amprenavir, a widely used HIV PI, as a potent PXR-selective agonist.
Computational docking studies combined with site-direct mutagenesis identified several key residues within the ligand binding pocket of PXR that constitute points of interaction with amprenavir.
Amprenavir efficiently activated PXR and induced PXR target gene expression in vitro and in vivo.
Short-term exposure to amprenavir significantly increased plasma total cholesterol and atherogenic low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in wild-type mice, but not in PXR-deficient mice.
Amprenavir-mediated PXR activation stimulated the expression of several key intestinal genes involved in lipid homeostasis.
These findings provide critical mechanistic insight for understanding the impact of PIs on cardiovascular disease and demonstrate a potential role of PXR in mediating adverse effects of HIV PIs in humans.
