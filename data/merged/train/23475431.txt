Characteristics and determinants of adult patients with acute poisoning attending the accident and emergency department of a teaching hospital in Qatar.
Data about etiologic and demographic characteristics of acute poisoning in adults in Qatar are lacking.
This prospective observational study was undertaken to analyze characteristics and possible determinants of acute poisoning in adults in Qatar.
During 2010, 18,073 patients attended the emergency department of Hamad General Hospital, a teaching hospital in Qatar.
Out of them, 599 (3.3%) patients were diagnosed as "poisoning case" with either chemical or pharmaceutical substances.
The prevalence rate of poisoning incidence was 35.3/100,000 population.
Seven patients died, corresponding with a case-fatality rate of 0.39/1000.
The majority were male (65%) and the mean age was 34 years.
The poisons involved were mainly chemicals (61.6%) and pharmaceuticals (38.4%).
Female, mainly single, suffered more intentional poisoning compared to male.
Of the patients aged 60 years and above (7.2%), the majority (95.3%) suffered unintentional poisoning with pharmaceuticals; 56% with warfarin, 12% with digoxin and 7% with insulin.
Multivariate analysis shows that female gender, single status, younger than 35 years of age, being poisoned by pharmaceutical products, and the need for hospitalization are significant determinants for acute intentional poisoning after adjusting all other possible covariates.
The findings of this study can be used to establish awareness and prophylactic campaigns in Qatar.
