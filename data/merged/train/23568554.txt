Cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein- a vital link in embryonic hormonal adaptation.
The transcription factor cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) and activating transcription factors (ATFs) are downstream components of the insulin/IGF cascade, playing crucial roles in maintaining cell viability and embryo survival.
One of the CREB target genes is adiponectin which acts synergistically with insulin.
We have studied the CREB-ATF-adiponectin network in rabbit preimplantation development in vivo and in vitro.
From the blastocyst stage onwards CREB and ATF1, 3 and 4 are present with increasing expression for CREB, ATF1 and 3 during gastrulation and with a dominant expression in the embryoblast (EB).
In vitro stimulation with insulin and IGF1 reduced CREB and ATF1 transcripts by approx.
50%, while CREB phosphorylation was increased.
Activation of CREB was accompanied by subsequent reduction in adiponectin and adiponectin receptor 1 (adipoR1) expression.
Under in vivo conditions of diabetes type 1, maternal adiponectin levels were up-regulated in serum and endometrium.
Embryonic CREB expression was altered in a cell lineage-specific pattern.
While in EB cells CREB localization did not change, it was translocated from the nucleus into the cytosol in trophoblast (TB) cells.
In TB adiponectin expression was increased [diabetic 427.8±59.3 pg/ml versus normoinsulinaemic 143.9±26.5 pg/ml], while it was no longer measureable in the EB.
Analysis of embryonic adiponectin receptors showed an increased expression of adipoR1 and no changes in adipoR2 transcription.
We conclude that the transcription factors CREB and ATFs vitally participate in embryo-maternal crosstalk prior to implantation in a cell lineage-specific manner.
Embryonic CREB/ATFs act as insulin/IGF sensors.
Lack of insulin is compensated by a CREB-mediated adiponectin expression which may maintain glucose uptake in blastocysts grown in diabetic mothers.
