FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to chemical compounds that inhibit cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) and are expected to have utility in raising HDL-C, lowering LDL-C, and in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Atherosclerosis and its clinical consequences, including coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke and peripheral vascular disease, represent a truly enormous burden to the health care systems of the industrialized world. In the United States alone, approximately 13 million patients have been diagnosed with CHD, and greater than one half million deaths are attributed to CHD each year. Further, this toll is expected to grow over the next quarter century as an epidemic in obesity and diabetes continues to grow. It has long been recognized that in mammals, variations in circulating lipoprotein profiles correlate with the risk of atherosclerosis and CHD. The clinical success of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, especially the statins, in reducing coronary events is based on the reduction of circulating low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), levels of which correlate directly with an increased risk for atherosclerosis. More recently, epidemiologic studies have demonstrated an inverse relationship between high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and atherosclerosis, leading to the conclusion that low serum HDL-C levels are associated with an increased risk for CHD. Metabolic control of lipoprotein levels is a complex and dynamic process involving many factors. One important metabolic control in man is the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), a plasma glycoprotein that catalyzes the movement of cholesteryl esters from HDL to the apoB containing lipoproteins, especially VLDL (see Hesler, C. B., et. al. (1987) Purification and characterization of human plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein. J. Biol. Chem. 262(5), 2275-2282)). Under physiological conditions, the net reaction is a heteroexchange in which CETP carries triglyceride to HDL from the apoB lipoprotein and transports cholesterol ester from HDL to the apoB lipoprotein. In humans, CETP plays a role in reverse cholesterol transport, the process whereby cholesterol is returned to the liver from peripheral tissues. Intriguingly, many animals do not possess CETP, including animals that have high HDL levels and are known to be resistant to coronary heart disease, such as rodents (see Guyard-Dangremont, V., et. al., (1998) Phospholipid and cholesteryl ester transfer activities in plasma from 14 vertebrate species. Relation to atherogenesis susceptibility, Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 120(3), 517-525). Numerous epidemiologic studies correlating the effects of natural variation in CETP activity with respect to coronary heart disease risk have been performed, including studies on a small number of known human null mutations (see Hirano, K.-I., Yamashita, S. and Matsuzawa, Y. (2000) Pros and cons of inhibiting cholesteryl ester transfer protein, Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 11(6), 589-596). These studies have clearly demonstrated an inverse correlation between plasma HDL-C concentration and CETP activity (see Inazu, A., et. al. (2000) Cholesteryl ester transfer protein and atherosclerosis, Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 11(4), 389-396), leading to the hypothesis that pharmacologic inhibition of CETP lipid transfer activity may be beneficial to humans by increasing levels of HDL-C while lowering LDL-C. Despite the significant therapeutic advance that statins such as simvastatin and atorvastatin represent, statins only achieve a risk reduction of approximately one-third in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis and ensuing atherosclerotic disease events. Currently, few pharmacologic therapies are available that favorably raise circulating levels of HDL-C. Certain statins and some fibrates offer modest HDL-C gains. Niacin provides an effective therapy for raising HDL-C but suffers from patient compliance issues, due in part to side effects such as flushing. Drugs that inhibit CETP (CETP inhibitors) have been under development with the expectation that they will effectively raise HDL cholesterol levels and also reduce the incidence of atherosclerosis in patients. Torcetrapib was the first drug that was tested in a long-term outcomes clinical trial. The clinical trial of torcetrapib was terminated early due to a higher incidence of mortality in patients to whom torcetrapib and atorvastatin were administered concomitantly compared with patients who were treated with atorvastatin alone. The cause of the increased mortality is not completely understood, but it is not believed to be associated with the CETP inhibiting effects of the drug. Dalcetrapib was recently tested in a Phase III outcomes trial, which was terminated early because the interim data did not show a clinical benefit. There were no safety issues detected for dalcetrapib. Anacetrapib is currently the only CETP inhibitor being tested in a large scale Phase III clinical outcomes trial. Data from the recently completed DEFINE Phase II/III trial of anacetrapib are promising. Patients who were treated with anacetrapib along with baseline statin therapy showed an increase of HDL-C of 138% and a decrease of LDL-C of 40% compared with patients who were treated with just a statin. See: N. Engl. J. Med. 2010: 363: 2406-15. The DEFINE study was not carried out on a large enough scale to serve as a pivotal outcomes trial, but the data in the DEFINE trial were sufficient to indicate that an increase in mortality for patients treated with anacetrapib is unlikely. Additional drug candidates are in development. Evacetrapib currently appears to be the next CETP inhibitor that will proceed to a Phase III outcomes trial. Additional compounds are being sought that may have properties that are advantageous compared with the CETP inhibitors that have so far been studied or are currently being studied. Such properties may include, for example, higher potency, reduced off-target activity, better pharmacodynamics, higher bioavailability, or a reduced food effect compared with many of the highly lipophilic compounds that have so far been studied. “Food effect” refers to the variability in exposure to the active drug that occurs depending on when the patient had last eaten, whether or not the drug is administered with food, and the fat content of the food.

Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention encompass any composition made by admixing a compound of Formula I or II and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The substituent “tetrazole” means a 2H-tetrazol-5-yl substituent group and tautomers thereof. Optical Isomers—Diastereomers—Geometric Isomers—Tautomers The compounds disclosed herein generally have at least one asymmetric center, and can thus occur as pure stereoisomers and as mixtures of stereoisomers, including racemates, racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, mixtures of enantiomers, diastereomeric mixtures and individual diastereomers in all ratios. The invention includes all possible enantiomers and diastereomers and mixtures of two or more stereoisomers, for example mixtures of enantiomers and/or diastereomers, in all ratios. Thus, enantiomers are a subject of the invention in enantiomerically pure form, both as levorotatory and as dextrorotatory antipodes, in the form of racemates and in the form of mixtures of the two enantiomers in all ratios. In the case of a cis/trans isomerism the invention includes both the cis form and the trans form as well as mixtures of these forms in all ratios. The preparation of individual stereoisomers can be carried out, if desired, by separation of a mixture by customary methods, for example by chromatography or crystallization, by the use of stereochemically uniform starting materials for the synthesis or by stereoselective synthesis. Optionally a derivatization can be carried out before a separation of stereoisomers. The separation of a mixture of stereoisomers can be carried out at an intermediate step during the synthesis of a compound of Formula I or II or it can be done on a final racemic product. Absolute stereochemistry may be determined by X-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing a stereogenic center of known configuration. Where compounds of this invention are capable of tautomerization, all individual tautomers as well as mixtures thereof are included in the scope of this invention. The present invention includes all such isomers, as well as salts, solvates (which includes hydrates) and solvated salts of such racemates, enantiomers, diastereomers and tautomers and mixtures thereof. Different stereoisomers having the same 2-dimensional chemical structure may have different levels of activity with respect to CETP inhibition, so that some stereoisomers may have higher activity than others. The compounds that are potent inhibitors of CETP may have utility in patients for raising HDL-C, lowering LDL-C, treating dyslipidemia, and for preventing, treating or delaying the onset of conditions that are related to atherosclerosis. Stereoisomers that have little or no activity may have utility as research tools for better understanding CETP inhibition. All stereoisomers and mixtures of stereoisomers of the claimed compounds thus have utility. The compounds of Formula I or II may also occur as atropisomers (rotamers) due to hindered rotation, which may be observable by NMR spectroscopy, and in some cases may be stable enough with respect to conversion by bond rotation to other atropisomers that they can be isolated and assayed. Salts When the compounds of Formula I contain one or more acidic or basic groups the invention also includes the corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Thus, the compounds of Formula I which contain acidic groups can be used according to the invention, for example, as alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts or as ammonium salts. Examples of such salts include but are not limited to sodium salts, potassium salts, calcium salts, magnesium salts or salts with ammonia or organic amines such as, for example, ethylamine, ethanolamine, triethanolamine or amino acids. Compounds of Formula I which contain one or more basic groups, i.e. groups which can be protonated, can be used according to the invention in the form of their acid addition salts with inorganic or organic acids as, for example but not limited to, salts with hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, benzenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, naphthalenedisulfonic acids, oxalic acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, benzoic acid, formic acid, propionic acid, pivalic acid, diethylacetic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, pimelic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, malic acid, sulfaminic acid, phenylpropionic acid, gluconic acid, ascorbic acid, isonicotinic acid, citric acid, adipic acid, etc. If the compounds of Formula I simultaneously contain acidic and basic groups in the molecule the invention also includes, in addition to the salt forms mentioned, inner salts or betaines (zwitterions). Salts can be obtained from the compounds of Formula I by customary methods which are known to the person skilled in the art, for example by combination with an organic or inorganic acid or base in a solvent or dispersant, or by anion exchange or cation exchange from other salts. The present invention also includes all salts of the compounds of Formula I which, owing to low physiological compatibility, are not directly suitable for use in pharmaceuticals but which can be used, for example, as intermediates for chemical reactions or for the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Furthermore, compounds of the present invention may exist in one or more amorphous forms and/or one or more crystalline forms, and as such all amorphous and crystalline forms and mixtures thereof of the compounds of Formula I are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention. In addition, some of the compounds of the instant invention may form solvates with water (i.e., a hydrate) or common organic solvents. Such solvates and hydrates, particularly the pharmaceutically acceptable solvates and hydrates, of the instant compounds are likewise encompassed within the scope of this invention, along with un-solvated and anhydrous forms. It will be understood that, as used herein, references to the compounds of Formula I and II and to the examples are meant to also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs, where such salts and prodrugs are possible. Prodrugs Prodrugs, which are compounds that are converted to the compound of Formula I or II as they are being administered to a patient or after they have been administered to a patient, are also compounds of formula I or II in the sense that they provide the claimed pharmaceutically active drug moiety to the patient. Isotopes In the compounds of Formula I and Formula II, the atoms may exhibit their natural isotopic abundances, or one or more of the atoms may be artificially enriched in a particular isotope having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number predominantly found in nature. The present invention is meant to include all suitable isotopic variations of the compounds of generic Formula I and Formula II. For example, different isotopic forms of hydrogen (H) include protium (1H) and deuterium (2H). Protium is the predominant hydrogen isotope found in nature. Enriching for deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages, such as increasing in vivo half-life or reducing dosage requirements, or may provide a compound useful as a standard for characterization of biological samples. Isotopically-enriched compounds within generic Formula I and II can be prepared without undue experimentation by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the Schemes and Examples herein using appropriate isotopically-enriched reagents and/or intermediates. Utilities The compounds disclosed herein, including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, are potent inhibitors of CETP. The compounds may therefore be useful in treating mammalian patients, preferably human patients, having diseases and conditions that are treated by inhibition of CETP. One aspect of the present invention provides a method for treating or reducing the risk of developing a disease or condition that may be treated or prevented by inhibition of CETP by administering a therapeutically effective amount of the compound of Formula I or II to a patient in need of treatment. The patient is a human or mammal, but is most often a human. A “therapeutically effective amount” is the amount of compound that is effective in obtaining a desired clinical outcome in the treatment of a specific disease. Diseases or conditions that may be treated with the compounds of Formula I or Formula II, or which the patient may have a reduced risk of developing as a result of being treated with the compounds of Formula I or Formula II, include: atherosclerosis, peripheral vascular disease, dyslipidemia, hyperbetalipoproteinemia, hypoalphalipoproteinemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, familial-hypercholesterolemia, cardiovascular disorders, angina, ischemia, cardiac ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, reperfusion injury, angioplastic restenosis, hypertension, vascular complications of diabetes, obesity, endotoxemia, and metabolic syndrome. There are reports in the scientific literature that suggest that inhibition of CETP may have utility in preventing or slowing the development of Alzheimer's disease. The compounds of Formula I and II may therefore have utility in preventing or delaying the progression of Alzheimer's disease or other neurodegenerative diseases. The compounds disclosed herein are particularly effective in raising HDL-C and/or increasing the ratio of HDL-C to LDL-C. The compounds may also be effective in reducing LDL-C, and may be effective in treating dyslipidemia. These changes in HDL-C and LDL-C may be beneficial in treating atherosclerosis, reducing or delaying the development of atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of developing atherosclerosis, or preventing atherosclerosis. The compounds disclosed herein may thus be beneficial in treating atherosclerosis, reducing or delaying the development of atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of developing atherosclerosis, or preventing atherosclerosis. Likely indications for atherosclerosis and dyslipidemia using the compounds described herein are written below, where the drug product is titled “CETP inhibitor:” Atherosclerosis. In patients at high risk of cardiovascular events because of existing coronary, cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular disease, CETP inhibitor co-administered with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is indicated to reduce the risk of coronary mortality, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization procedures, ischemic stroke, and cardiovascular death. Dyslipidemia. CETP inhibitor co-administered with a statin is indicated to reduce elevated LDL-C, apolipoprotein B (ApoB), lipoprotein a (Lp(a)), non-HDL-C, and total cholesterol; and increase HDL-C and apolipoprotein A-1 (Apo A-1) in patients with mixed or primary dyslipidemia. Administration and Dose Ranges Any suitable route of administration may be employed for providing a mammal, especially a human, with an effective dose of the compounds described herein. For example, oral, rectal, topical, parenteral, ocular, pulmonary, nasal, and the like may be employed. Dosage forms include tablets, troches, dispersions, suspensions, solutions, capsules, creams, ointments, aerosols, and the like. Preferably the compound of Formula I or II is administered orally. When treating the diseases for which the compound of Formula I or II is indicated, generally satisfactory results are expected when the compound of Formula I or II is administered at a daily dosage of from about 0.1 milligram to about 1000 milligram in one dose daily or divided into more than one dose per day. Oral administration will usually be carried out using tablets. Examples of doses in tablets include 0.1 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 60 mg, 70 mg, 80 mg, 90 mg, 100 mg, 110 mg, 120 mg, 130 mg, 140 mg, 150 mg, 160 mg, 170 mg, 180 mg, 190 mg, 200 mg, 210 mg, 220 mg, 230 mg, 240 mg, 250 mg, 275 mg, 300 mg, 350 mg, 400 mg, 450 mg, 500 mg, and 1000 mg. Other oral forms can also have the same dosages (e.g. capsules). A preferred dose is likely in the range of 50-200 mg. Pharmaceutical Compositions Another aspect of the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions which comprise the compound of Formula I or II and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise the compound of Formula I or II or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt as an active ingredient, as well as a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases or acids including inorganic bases or acids and organic bases or acids. A pharmaceutical composition may also comprise a prodrug, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, if a prodrug is administered. A pharmaceutical composition may also consist essentially of the compound of Formula I or II, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the compound, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, without other therapeutic ingredients. Pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated to be suitable for oral, rectal, topical, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous), ocular (ophthalmic), pulmonary (nasal or buccal inhalation), or nasal administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the conditions being treated and on the nature of the active ingredient. They may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well-known in the art of pharmacy. In practical use, the compound of Formula I or II can be combined as the active ingredient in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or parenteral (including intravenous). In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations, such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, hard and soft capsules and tablets, with the solid oral preparations being preferred over the liquid preparations. Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. If desired, tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1 percent of active compound. The percentage of active compound in these compositions may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 percent to about 60 percent of the weight of the unit. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage will be obtained. The active compound can also be administered intranasally as, for example, liquid drops or spray. The tablets, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin. When a dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain, in addition to the active ingredient, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. The compound of formula I or II may also be administered parenterally. Solutions or suspensions of the compound can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations may contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g. glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils. Combination Therapy The compound of Formula I or II, including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may be used in pharmaceutical combinations with other drugs that may also be useful in the treatment or amelioration of the diseases or conditions for which the compound of Formula I or II is useful. Such other drugs may be administered, by a route and in an amount commonly used therefor, contemporaneously or sequentially with the compound of Formula I or II. When the compound of Formula I or II is used contemporaneously with one or more other drugs, a pharmaceutical composition in unit dosage form containing such other drugs and the compound of Formula I or II is preferred. However, the combination therapy also includes therapies in which the compound of Formula I or II and one or more other drugs are administered concomitantly, on the same or different schedules. The drugs that are administered, whether alone or in combination with other drugs, include the free-acid, free-base, and pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms, pro-drug forms (including but not limited to esters), and salts of pro-drugs of the medicinal agents where chemically possible When oral formulations are used, the drugs may be combined into a single combination tablet or other oral dosage form, or the drugs may be packaged together as separate tablets or other oral dosage forms. It is also contemplated that when used in combination with one or more other active ingredients, the compound of formula I or II and the other active ingredients may be used in lower doses than when each is used singly. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the compound of formula I or II include those that contain one or more other active ingredients, in addition to the compound of Formula I or II. The compound of Formula I or II will likely be approved initially for coadministration with a statin, which could be administered in the form of a fixed dose combination of the compound of formula I or II and a statin. Additional drugs may also be administered in combination with the compound of Formula I or II and the statin, either by coadministration or in a fixed dose combination. The compound of formula I or II and the drugs that are administered with it may be administered as pharmaceutically acceptable salts, as prodrugs, or otherwise formulated for immediate release, extended release, or controlled release, as necessary. Examples of statins that may be administered in combination with the compound of Formula I or II include, but are not limited to, (i) simvastatin and lovastatin which are marketed as ZOCOR® and MEVACOR® in lactone prodrug form and function as inhibitors after administration, and (ii) dihydroxy open ring acid HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as atorvastatin (particularly the calcium salt sold in LIPITOR®), rosuvastatin (particularly the calcium salt sold in CRESTOR®), pravastatin (particularly the sodium salt sold in PRAVACHOL®), fluvastatin (particularly the sodium salt sold in LESCOL®), and pitavastatin (particularly the calcium salt sold in LIVALO®), and (iii) other statins that may yet be developed. Preferred statins for combination therapy include atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvasatin, as described above. Cholesterol absorption inhibitors, and particularly ezetimibe (ZETIA®), as well as other cholesterol absorption inhibitors, such as stanol esters, beta-sitosterol, sterol glycosides such as tiqueside, and other azetidinones, may be administered with the compound of Formula I or II, generally with a statin, as described above. The preferred cholesterol absorption inhibitor is ezetimibe. Combinations of the compound of formula I or II with a statin and a cholesterol inhibitor, such as ezetimibe, are also contemplated. Preferred 3-component combinations include combinations of the compound of formula I or II with simvastatin, atorvastatin, or rosuvastatin in combination with ezetimibe, where the statins may be salt forms or prodrugs as described above. The combination of simvastatin with ezetimibe is currently marketed as VYTORIN®. Other cholesterol reducing drugs that may be coadministered with the compound of formula I or II in addition to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and cholesterol absorption inhibitors include (i) bile acid sequestrants, as for example cholestyramine, colestipol, dialkylaminoalkyl derivatives of a cross-linked dextran, Colestid®, and LoCholest®, (ii) niacin and related compounds, such as nicotinyl alcohol, nicotinamide, and nicotinic acid or a salt thereof, in an immediate release or extended release form, which may optionally be in the forme of a combination with a DP-1 antagonist, such as laropiprant (TREDAPTIVE®); (iii) PPARα agonists, such as gemfibrozil and fenofibric acid derivatives (fibrates), including clofibrate, fenofibrate, bezafibrate, ciprofibrate, and etofibrate, (iv) acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitors, such as avasimibe and melinamide, and including selective ACAT-1 and ACAT-2 inhibitors and dual inhibitors, (v) phenolic anti-oxidants, such as probucol, (vi) microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP)/ApoB secretion inhibitors, (vii) anti-oxidant vitamins, such as vitamins C and E and beta carotene, (viii) thyromimetics, (ix) LDL (low density lipoprotein) receptor inducers, (x) platelet aggregation inhibitors, for example glycoprotein IIb/IIIa fibrinogen receptor antagonists and aspirin, (xi) vitamin B12 (also known as cyanocobalamin), (xii) folic acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof, such as the sodium salt and the methylglucamine salt, (xiii) FXR and LXR ligands, including both inhibitors and agonists, (xiv) agents that enhance ABCA1 gene expression, (xv) ileal bile acid transporters, and (xvi) niacin receptor agonists (e.g. acipimox and acifran) and partial agonists. Finally the compound of formula I or II can be combined with compounds that are useful for treating other diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity, as well as other anti-atherosclerotic compounds. Such combinations may be used to treat one or more of such diseases as diabetes, obesity, atherosclerosis, and dyslipidemia, or more than one of the diseases associated with metabolic syndrome. The combinations may exhibit synergistic activity in treating these diseases, allowing for the possibility of administering reduced doses of active ingredients, such as doses that otherwise might be sub-therapeutic.

The combination therapies described above which use the compounds of Formula I or Formula II may also be useful in the treatment of the metabolic syndrome. According to one widely used definition, a patient having metabolic syndrome is characterized as having three or more symptoms selected from the following group of five symptoms: (1) abdominal obesity; (2) hypertriglyceridemia; (3) low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL); (4) high blood pressure; and (5) elevated fasting glucose, which may be in the range characteristic of Type 2 diabetes if the patient is also diabetic. Each of these symptoms is defined clinically in the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III, or ATP III), National Institutes of Health, 2001, NIH Publication No. 01-3670. Patients with metabolic syndrome have an increased risk of developing the macrovascular and microvascular complications that are listed above, including atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. The combinations described above may ameliorate more than one symptom of metabolic syndrome concurrently (e.g. two symptoms, three symptoms, four symptoms, or all five of the symptoms). Assays Protocol: Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA) for CETP Activity First, low density lipoprotein (LDL) (Meridian) was biotinylated by incubating LDL with biotin for 1 hour on ice, after which it was dialyzed to remove free biotin. Then compounds at varying concentrations were incubated with 15 nM CETP (reagent production group, In Vitro Pharmacology, MRL Rahway) and 50 ug/ml of the biotinylated LDL in 50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, for 1 hour at 37° C. The reaction was started by adding 3H-cholesterol ester high density lipoprotein (HDL) (American Radiochemicals Corp) at a concentration of 0.6 nM. The reaction proceeded for 2 hours at 37° C., after which time it was quenched by the addition of 12% acetic acid. PVT streptavadin-coated scintillation proximity beads, which had been brought to room temperature, were then added at a concentration of 4 mg/ml. The assay was then mixed and counted after one half hour in a Microbeta plate reader. In Vitro Radioactive Assays of CETP-Catalyzed CE and TG Transfer (RTA Assay) Reagents and sources are: [3H] cholesteryl oleate (GE #TRK.886), [3H] Triolein (Perkin-Elmer NET-431), Butylated hydroxyl toluene (Aldrich, #D4740-4), DOPC (Sigma, # P6354), Sodium Bromide (Fisher scientific #S255-500), PEG 8000 (Fisher, #BP233-1), and human HDL (Intracel Corp #RP-036). An in vitro assay for determining IC50's to identify compounds that inhibit CETP transfer activity is performed based on a modification of a published method (Morton and Zilversmit, (1981) A plasma inhibitor of triglyceride and cholesteryl ester transfer activities, J. Biol. Chem. 256(23), 11992-11995). The ability of inhibitors to alter CETP activity is performed using two different assays: one using recombinant CETP and one using an endogenous plasma source of CETP. Both assays measure the transfer of [3H] cholesteryl oleate or [3H] triolein from exogenous LDL to HDL. Radiolabeled donor particles are generated by first combining 100 μl of 200 μM butylated hydroxyl toluene in CHCl3, 216 μL of 21.57 mM DOPC in EtOH, and either 500 μCi [3H]-triolein (Perkin Elmer #NET-431) or 500 μCi [3H]-cholesteryl oleate (GE #TRK886) in a glass tube. Reagents are mixed, dried under nitrogen, and then resuspended in 2 mL of 50 mM Tris, 27 μM EDTA at pH 7.4. After a brief vortex, the solution is sonicated until clear and mixed with 20 mL of fresh human serum. The mixture is incubated overnight at 37° C. The [3H] labeled LDL substrate is separated at 1.063 g/ml density by sequential ultracentrifugal flotation in NaBr according to the method of Havel, Eder, et al., 1955, and Chapman, Goldstein, et al., 1981. Once isolated the particles are dialyzed 3× in CETP buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). Human HDL is purchased from Intracel and used as the acceptor particles. Transfer assays are performed in a 96-well v-bottom polypropylene plate. For the RTA using recombinant CETP (2% RTA), an assay cocktail is prepared with the final concentrations 128 μg/mL HDL, 20 nM rCETP, 2% human serum, and 1×CETP buffer. 1 μL of each test compound diluted in DMSO is added to 47 μL of assay cocktail per well and incubated at 37° C. for 1 hour. To initiate the transfer reaction, 2 μL radiolabeled LDL is added. After an additional 60 min of incubation at 37° C., the transfer action is terminated by precipitation of LDL with an equal volume of 20% W/V PEG 8000. The plates are centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4° C. A 40 μL aliquot of the HDL-containing supernatant is transferred to a Packard Optiplate™ with 200 μL of MicroScint™ 20. After mixing, plates are counted by liquid scintillation. Counts present in the supernatant for blanks (wells containing only HDL acceptor, CETP buffer and DMSO) are subtracted from those containing test compounds and used to correct for non-specific transfer. For the transfer assay using endogenous CETP from serum (95% RTA), the same procedure is used except that human serum is added such that a final concentration of serum of 95% of the total assay volume is achieved, yielding a concentration of approximately 15 nM endogenous CETP in the assay. This is then combined with HDL and CETP buffer and the reaction proceeds as above and is terminated as described. Comparison of the counts of samples with inhibitors to an uninhibited (DMSO only) positive control yield a percent inhibition. A plot of percent inhibition vs. log of inhibitor concentration, fit to a Sigmoidal 4 parameter equation is used to calculate IC50.

General Synthetic Schemes The schemes and examples are illustrative and are not to be construed as limiting the invention. Benzyl ((2S)-1-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-1-hydroxypropan-2-yl)carbamate was synthesized according to a published procedure (Ying et al., J. Org. Chem., 2006, 71, 840-843). After switching the protecting group from Cbz to Boc, the secondary alcohol was converted to a leaving group (mesylate), which was displaced with potassium thioacetate. After deprotection, the resulting aminothiol was cyclized with triphosgene to give the thiazolidinone compound (intermediate A1). Intermediate A1 was alkylated to give intermediate A2. Intermediate A1 (4S,5R)-5-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-4-methylthiazolidin-2-one Step 1: To benzyl ((2S)-1-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-1-hydroxypropan-2-yl)carbamate (3.0 g, 7.12 mmol) in ethanol (100 mL) was added palladium on carbon (0.379 g, 0.356 mmol).

Preparation of Intermediate B begins with formation of a tert-butyl ester which is then subjected to a Miyuara coupling to obtain the corresponding boronic ester. Suzuki coupling with a commercially available 5-bromo-3-chloro-2-methoxypyridine yields the coupled chloride. A second Miyaura coupling provides the desired boronic ester Intermediate B. Intermediate B1 tert-butyl 4-[6-methoxy-5-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)pyridin-3-yl]-3-methylbenzoate Step 1: To a 250 mL RBF was added 4-bromo-3-methylbenzoic acid (10 g, 46.5 mmol), DMAP (8.52 g, 69.8 mmol), and tert-butyl alcohol (100 mL). Di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (12.96 mL, 55.8 mmol) was added via a syringe to the solution, which caused vigorous bubbling, foaming and the loss of some material. The remaining reaction mixture was heated at 70° C. overnight. The reaction was cooled to room temperature, and the volatiles were removed under reduced pressure. Crude material was diluted with ethyl acetate:hexanes (1:4, 200 mL) and was washed sequentially with 5% aqueous KOH (200 mL) and saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (2×100 mL). The organics were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated before purification by column chromatography. tort-Butyl 4-bromo-3-methylbenzoate was isolated as a colorless oil. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) δ 7.87 (s, 1H), 7.67 (d, J=8.3 Hz, 1H), 7.60 (d, J=8.2 Hz, 1H), 2.47 (s, 3H), 1.62 (s, 9H).

The flask was sealed and was stirred at 80° C. overnight. The reaction was cooled to room temperature, diluted with ethyl acetate, washed with water, filtered, and concentrated. The resultant residue was purified by column chromatography to yield tert-butyl 4-(5-chloro-6-methoxypyridin-3-yl)-3-methylbenzoate. MS ESI calc'd. for C18H21C1NO3 [M+H]+ 334.1. found 334.0.

The system was evacuated and backfilled with nitrogen (3×) and was heated to 120° C. for 2 hours. The mixture was cooled, filtered over Celite (ethyl acetate wash) and was concentrated. The residue was purified by column chromatography to afford tert-butyl 4-[6-methoxy-5-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)pyridin-3-yl]-3-methylbenzoate as a solid.
