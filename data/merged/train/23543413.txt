A Re-evaluation of the Role of hCTR1, the Human High Affinity Cu Transporter in Pt-Drug Entry into Human Cells.
Cisplatin (cDDP) is an anti-cancer drug used in a number of malignancies including testicular, ovarian, cervical, bladder, lung, head, and neck cancers.
Its use is limited by the development of resistance, often rationalized via effects on cellular uptake.
It has been claimed that hCTR1, the human high affinity copper transporter, is the major entry pathway for cDDP and related drugs via a mechanism that mimics copper.
This is an unexpected property of hCTR1, a highly selective copper (I) transporter.
We compared the uptake rates of copper with cDDP (and several analogs) into HEK293 cells over-expressing wild-type or mutant hCTR1, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mefs) that do or do not express CTR1, and human ovarian tumor cells, sensitive or resistant to cDDP.
We have also compared the effects of extracellular copper, which causes regulatory endocytosis of hCTR1, to those of cDDP.
We confirm the correlation between higher hCTR1 levels and higher Pt-drug uptake in tumor cells sensitive to the drug.
However, we show that hCTR1 is not the major entry route of platinum-drugs and that the copper transporter is not internalized in response to extracellular drug.
Our data suggest the major entry pathway for platinum-drugs is not saturable at relevant concentrations and not protein-mediated.
Clinical trials have been initiated that depend upon regulating membrane levels of hCTR1.
If reduced drug uptake is a major factor in resistance, hCTR1 is unlikely to be a productive target in attempts to enhance efficacy, although the proteins involved in copper homeostasis may play a role.
