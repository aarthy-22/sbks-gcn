Effects of fenoterol on beta-adrenoceptor and muscarinic M2 receptor function in bovine tracheal smooth muscle.
Prolonged (18 h) incubation of isolated bovine tracheal smooth muscle with the beta2-adrenoceptor agonist fenoterol (10 microM) induced desensitization of isoprenaline-induced adenylyl cyclase activity in bovine tracheal smooth muscle membranes, characterized by a 25% decrease in maximal effect (Emax) (P < 0.05), while the sensitivity to the agonist (pEC50) was unchanged.
The Emax value of isoprenaline-induced smooth muscle relaxation of submaximal methacholine-induced contractile tones was similarly reduced by about 25% (P < 0.001), while the pEC50 value was diminished by 1.0 log unit (P < 0.001).
As determined by 30 microM gallamine-induced muscarinic M2 receptor antagonism and pertussis toxin-induced inactivation of G(i alpha), muscarinic M2 receptor-mediated functional antagonism did not play a role in isoprenaline-induced relaxation of bovine tracheal smooth muscle contracted by methacholine, both in control and in 18-h fenoterol-treated tissue.
In line with these observations, we found no enhanced muscarinic M2 receptor-mediated inhibition of 1 microM forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity after 18-h fenoterol treatment.
These data indicate that 18-h fenoterol treatment of bovine tracheal smooth muscle induces beta2-adrenoceptor desensitization and reduced functional antagonism of methacholine-induced contraction by beta-adrenoceptor agonists, without a change of muscarinic M2 receptor function.
