FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to certain substituted tricyclic acid derivatives of Formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which exhibit useful pharmacological properties, for example, as agonists of the S1P1 receptor. Also provided by the present invention are pharmaceutical compositions containing compounds of the invention, and methods of using the compounds and compositions of the invention in the treatment of S1P1-associated disorders, for example, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, transplant rejection, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ulcerative colitis, type I diabetes, acne, myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, hypertensive nephropathy, glomerulosclerosis, gastritis, polymyositis, thyroiditis, vitiligo, hepatitis, biliary cirrhosis, microbial infections and associated diseases, viral infections and associated diseases, diseases and disorders mediated by lymphocytes, auto immune diseases, inflammatory diseases, and cancer. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to compounds that are S1P1 receptor agonists having at least immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory, and/or hemostatic activities, e.g. by virtue of modulating leukocyte trafficking, sequestering lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid tissues, and/or enhancing vascular integrity. The present application is in part focused on addressing an unmet need for immunosuppressive agents such as may be orally available which have therapeutic efficacy for at least autoimmune diseases and disorders, inflammatory diseases and disorders (e.g., acute and chronic inflammatory conditions), transplant rejection, cancer, and/or conditions that have an underlying defect in vascular integrity or that are associated with angiogenesis such as may be pathologic (e.g., as may occur in inflammation, tumor development, and atherosclerosis) with fewer side effects such as the impairment of immune responses to systemic infection. The sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors 1-5 constitute a family of G protein-coupled receptors with a seven-transmembrane domain. These receptors, referred to as S1P1 to S1P5 (formerly termed endothelial differentiation gene (EDG) receptor-1, -5, -3, -6, and -8, respectively; Chun et al., Pharmacological Reviews, 54:265-269, 2002), are activated via binding by sphingosine-1-phosphate, which is produced by the sphingosine kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of sphingosine. S1P1, S1P4, and S1P5 receptors activate Gi but not Gq, whereas S1P2 and S1P3 receptors activate both Gi and Gq. The S1P3 receptor, but not the S1P1 receptor, responds to an agonist with an increase in intracellular calcium. S1P receptor agonists having agonist activity on the S1P1 receptor have been shown to rapidly and reversibly induce lymphopenia (also referred to as peripheral lymphocyte lowering (PLL); Hale et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 14:3351-3355, 2004). This is attended by clinically useful immunosuppression by virtue of sequestering T- and B-cells in secondary lymphoid tissue (lymph nodes and Peyer's patches) and thus apart from sites of inflammation and organ grafts (Rosen et al., Immunol. Rev., 195:160-177, 2003; Schwab et al., Nature Immunol., 8:1295-1301, 2007). This lymphocyte sequestration, for example in lymph nodes, is thought to be a consequence of concurrent agonist-driven functional antagonism of the S1P1 receptor on T-cells (whereby the ability of S1P to mobilize T-cell egress from lymph nodes is reduced) and persistent agonism of the S1P1 receptor on lymph node endothelium (such that barrier function opposing transmigration of lymphocytes is increased) (Matloubian et al., Nature, 427:355-360, 2004; Baumruker et al., Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs, 16:283-289, 2007). It has been reported that agonism of the S1P1 receptor alone is sufficient to achieve lymphocyte sequestration (Sanna et al., J Biol Chem., 279:13839-13848, 2004) and that this occurs without impairment of immune responses to systemic infection (Brinkmann et al., Transplantation, 72:764-769, 2001; Brinkmann et al., Transplant Proc., 33:530-531, 2001). That agonism of endothelial S1P1 receptors has a broader role in promoting vascular integrity is supported by work implicating the S1P1 receptor in capillary integrity in mouse skin and lung (Sanna et al., Nat Chem Biol., 2:434-441, 2006). Vascular integrity can be compromised by inflammatory processes, for example as may derive from sepsis, major trauma and surgery so as to lead to acute lung injury or respiratory distress syndrome (Johan Groeneveld, Vascul. Pharmacol., 39:247-256, 2003). An exemplary S1P receptor agonist having agonist activity on the S1P1 receptor is FTY720 (fingolimod), an immunosuppressive agent currently in clinical trials (Martini et al., Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs, 16:505-518, 2007). FTY720 acts as a prodrug which is phosphorylated in vivo; the phosphorylated derivative is an agonist for S1P1, S1P3, S1P4, and S1P5 receptors (but not the S1P2 receptor) (Chiba, Pharmacology & Therapeutics, 108:308-319, 2005). FTY720 has been shown to rapidly and reversibly induce lymphopenia (also referred to as peripheral lymphocyte lowering (PLL); Hale et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 14:3351-3355, 2004). This is attended by clinically useful immunosuppression by virtue of sequestering T- and B-cells in secondary lymphoid tissue (lymph nodes and Peyer's patches) and thus apart from sites of inflammation and organ grafts (Rosen et al., Immunol. Rev., 195:160-177, 2003; Schwab et al., Nature Immunol., 8:1295-1301, 2007). In clinical trials, FTY720 elicited an adverse event (i.e., transient asymptomatic bradycardia) due to its agonism of the S1P3 receptor (Budde et al., J. Am. Soc. Nephrol., 13:1073-1083, 2002; Sanna et al., J. Biol. Chem., 279:13839-13848, 2004; Ogawa et al., BBRC, 361:621-628, 2007). FTY720 has been reported to have therapeutic efficacy in at least: a rat model for autoimmune myocarditis and a mouse model for acute viral myocarditis (Kiyabayashi et al., J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol., 35:410-416, 2000; Miyamoto et al., J. Am. Coll. Cardiol., 37:1713-1718, 2001); mouse models for inflammatory bowel disease including colitis (Mizushima et al., Inflamm. Bowel Dis., 10:182-192, 2004; Deguchi et al., Oncology Reports, 16:699-703, 2006; Fujii et al., Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol., 291:G267-G274, 2006; Daniel et al., J. Immunol., 178:2458-2468, 2007); a rat model for progressive mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (Martini et al., Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol., 292:F1761-F1770, 2007); a mouse model for asthma, suggested to be primarily through the S1P1 receptor on the basis of work using the S1P1 receptor agonist SEW2871 (Idzko et al, J. Clin. Invest., 116:2935-2944, 2006); a mouse model for airway inflammation and induction of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (Sawicka et al., J. Immunol., 171; 6206-6214, 2003); a mouse model for atopic dermatitis (Kohno et al., Biol. Pharm. Bull., 27:1392-1396, 2004); a mouse model for ischemia-reperfusion injury (Kaudel et al., Transplant. Proc, 39:499-502, 2007); a mouse model for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Okazaki et al., J. Rheumatol., 29:707-716, 2002; Herzinger et al, Am. J. Clin. Dermatol., 8:329-336, 2007); rat models for rheumatoid arthritis (Matsuura et al., Int. J. Immunopharmacol., 22:323-331, 2000; Matsuura et al., Inflamm. Res., 49:404-410, 2000); a rat model for autoimmune uveitis (Kurose et al., Exp. Eye Res., 70:7-15, 2000); mouse models for type I diabetes (Fu et al, Transplantation, 73:1425-1430, 2002; Maki et al., Transplantation, 74:1684-1686, 2002; Yang et al., Clinical Immunology, 107:30-35, 2003; Maki et al., Transplantation, 79:1051-1055, 2005); mouse models for atherosclerosis (Nofer et al., Circulation, 115:501-508, 2007; Keul et al., Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol., 27:607-613, 2007); a rat model for brain inflammatory reaction following traumatic brain injury (TBI) (Zhang et al., J. Cell. Mol. Med., 11:307-314, 2007); and mouse models for graft coronary artery disease and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (Hwang et al., Circulation, 100:1322-1329, 1999; Taylor et al., Blood, 110:3480-3488, 2007). In vitro results suggest that FTY720 may have therapeutic efficacy for fl-amyloid-related inflammatory diseases including Alzheimer's disease (Kaneider et al., FASEB J., 18:309-311, 2004). KRP-203, an S1P receptor agonist having agonist activity on the S1P1 receptor, has been reported to have therapeutic efficacy in a rat model for autoimmune myocarditis (Ogawa et al., BBRC, 361:621-628, 2007). Using the S1P1 receptor agonist SEW2871, it has been shown that agonism of endothelial S1P1 receptors prevents proinflammatory monocyte/endothelial interactions in type I diabetic vascular endothelium (Whetzel et al., Circ. Res., 99:731-739, 2006) and protects the vasculature against TNFα-mediated monocyte/endothelial interactions (Bolick et al., Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol., 25:976-981, 2005). Additionally, FTY720 has been reported to have therapeutic efficacy in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in rats and mice, a model for human multiple sclerosis (Brinkmann et al., J. Biol. Chem., 277:21453-21457, 2002; Fujino et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 305:70-77, 2003; Webb et al., J. Neuroimmunol., 153:108-121, 2004; Rausch et al., J. Magn. Reson. Imaging, 20:16-24, 2004; Kataoka et al., Cellular & Molecular Immunology, 2:439-448, 2005; Brinkmann et al., Pharmacology & Therapeutics, 115:84-105, 2007; Baumruker et al., Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs, 16:283-289, 2007; Balatoni et al., Brain Research Bulletin, 74:307-316, 2007). Furthermore, FTY720 has been found to have therapeutic efficacy for multiple sclerosis in clinical trials. In Phase II clinical trials for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, FTY720 was found to reduce the number of lesions detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical disease activity in patients with multiple sclerosis (Kappos et al., N. Engl. J. Med., 355:1124-1140, 2006; Martini et al., Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs, 16:505-518, 2007; Zhang et al., Mini-Reviews in Medicinal Chemistry, 7:845-850, 2007; Brinkmann, Pharmacology & Therapeutics, 115:84-105, 2007). FTY720 is currently in Phase III studies of remitting-relapsing multiple sclerosis (Brinkmann, Pharmacology & Therapeutics, 115:84-105, 2007; Baumruker et al., Expert. Opin. Investig. Drugs, 16:283-289, 2007; Dev et al., Pharmacology and Therapeutics, 117:77-93, 2008). Recently, FTY720 has been reported to have anti-viral activity. Specific data has been presented in the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) mouse model, wherein the mice-were infected with either the Armstrong or the clone 13 strain of LCMV (Premenko-Lanier et al., Nature, 454, 894, 2008). FTY720 has been reported to impair migration of dendritic cells infected with Francisella tularensis to the mediastinal lymph node, thereby reducing the bacterial colonization of it. Francisella tularensis is associated with tularemia, ulceroglandular infection, respiratory infection and a typhoidal disease (E. Bar-Haim et al, PLoS Pathogens, 4(11): e1000211. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000211, 2008). It has also been recently reported that a short-term high dose of FTY720 rapidly reduced ocular infiltrates in experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis. When given in the early stages of ocular inflammation, FTY720 rapidly prevented retinal damage. It was reported to not only prevent infiltration of target organs, but also reduce existing infiltration (Raveney et al., Arch. Ophthalmol. 126(10), 1390, 2008). It has been reported that treatment with FTY720 relieved ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis in mice by reducing the number of mature osteoclasts attached to the bone surface. The data provided evidence that S1P controlled the migratory behaviour of osteoclast precursors, dynamically regulating bone mineral homeostasis (Ishii et al., Nature, advance online publication, 8 Feb. 2009, doi:10.1038/nature07713). Agonism of the S1P1 receptor has been implicated in enhancement of survival of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. Survival of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells is a required component of the remyelination process. Remyelination of multiple sclerosis lesions is considered to promote recovery from clinical relapses. (Miron et al., Ann. Neurol., 63:61-71, 2008; Coelho et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 323:626-635, 2007; Dev et al., Pharmacology and Therapeutics, 117:77-93, 2008). It also has been shown that the S1P1 receptor plays a role in platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced oligodendrocyte progenitor cell mitogenesis (Jung et al., Glia, 55:1656-1667, 2007). Agonism of the S1P1 receptor has also been reported to mediate migration of neural stem cells toward injured areas of the central nervous system (CNS), including in a rat model of spinal cord injury (Kimura et al., Stem Cells, 25:115-124, 2007). Agonism of the S1P1 receptor has been implicated in the inhibition of keratinocyte proliferation (Sauer et al., J. Biol. Chem., 279:38471-38479, 2004), consistent with reports that S1P inhibits keratinocyte proliferation (Kim et al., Cell Signal, 16:89-95, 2004). The hyperproliferation of keratinocytes at the entrance to the hair follicle, which can then become blocked, and an associated inflammation are significant pathogenetic factors of acne (Koreck et al., Dermatology, 206:96-105, 2003; Webster, Cutis, 76:4-7, 2005). FTY720 has been reported to have therapeutic efficacy in inhibiting pathologic angiogenesis, such as that as may occur in tumor development. Inhibition of angiogenesis by FTY720 is thought to involve agonism of the S1P1 receptor (00 et al., J. Biol. Chem., 282; 9082-9089, 2007; Schmid et al., J. Cell Biochem., 101:259-270, 2007). FTY720 has been reported to have therapeutic efficacy for inhibiting primary and metastatic tumor growth in a mouse model of melanoma (LaMontagne et al., Cancer Res., 66:221-231, 2006). FTY720 has been reported to have therapeutic efficacy in a mouse model for metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (Lee et al., Clin. Cancer Res., 11:84588466, 2005). It has been reported that oral administration of FTY720 to mice potently blocked VEGF-induced vascular permeability, an important process associated with angiogenesis, inflammation, and pathological conditions such as sepsis, hypoxia, and solid tumor growth (T Sanchez et al, J. Biol. Chem., 278(47), 47281-47290, 2003). Cyclosporin A and FK506 (calcineurin inhibitors) are drugs used to prevent rejection of transplanted organs. Although they are effective in delaying or suppressing transplant rejection, classical immunosuppressants such as cyclosporin A and FK506 are known to cause several undesirable side effects including nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, fl-cell toxicity and gastrointestinal discomfort. There is an unmet need in organ transplantation for an immunosuppressant without these side effects which is effective as a monotherapy or in combination with a classical immunosuppressant for inhibiting migration of, e.g., alloantigen-reactive T-cells to the grafted tissue, thereby prolonging graft survival. FTY720 has been shown to have therapeutic efficacy in transplant rejection both as a monotherapy and in synergistic combination with a classical immunosuppressant, including cyclosporin A, FK506 and RAD (an mTOR inhibitor). It has been shown that, unlike the classical immunosuppressants cyclosporin A, FK506 and RAD, FTY720 has efficacy for prolonging graft survival without inducing general immunosuppression, and this difference in drug action is believed to be relevant to the synergism observed for the combination (Brinkmann et al., Transplant Proc., 33:530-531, 2001; Brinkmann et al., Transplantation, 72:764-769, 2001). Agonism of the S1P1 receptor has been reported to have therapeutic efficacy for prolonging allograft survival in mouse and rat skin allograft models (Lima et al., Transplant Proc., 36:1015-1017, 2004; Yan et al., Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Lett., 16:3679-3683, 2006). FTY720 has been reported to have therapeutic efficacy for prolonging allograft survival in a rat cardiac allograft model (Suzuki et al., Transpl. Immunol., 4:252-255, 1996). FTY720 has been reported to act synergistically with cyclosporin A to prolong rat skin allograft survival (Yanagawa et al., J. Immunol., 160:5493-5499, 1998), to act synergistically with cyclosporin A and with FK506 to prolong rat cardiac allograft survival, and to act synergistically with cyclosporin A to prolong canine renal allograft survival and monkey renal allograft survival (Chiba et al., Cell Mol. Biol., 3:11-19, 2006). KRP-203, an S1P receptor agonist has been reported to have therapeutic efficacy for prolonging allograft survival in a rat skin allograft model and both as monotherapy and in synergistic combination with cyclosporin A in a rat cardiac allograft model (Shimizu et al., Circulation, 111:222-229, 2005). KRP-203 also has been reported to have therapeutic efficacy in combination with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF; a prodrug for which the active metabolite is mycophenolic acid, an inhibitor of purine biosynthesis) for prolonging allograft survival both in a rat renal allograft model and in a rat cardiac allograft model (Suzuki et al., J. Heart Lung Transplant, 25:302-209, 2006; Fujishiro et al., J. Heart Lung Transplant, 25:825-833, 2006). It has been reported that an agonist of the S1P1 receptor, AUY954, in combination with a subtherapeutic dose of RAD001 (Certican/Everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor) can prolong rat cardiac allograft survival (Pan et al., Chemistry & Biology, 13:1227-1234, 2006). In a rat small bowel allograft model, FTY720 has been reported to act synergistically with cyclosporin A to prolong small bowel allograft survival (Sakagawa et al., Transpl. Immunol., 13:161-168, 2004). FTY720 has been reported to have therapeutic efficacy in a mouse islet graft model (Fu et al., Transplantation, 73:1425-1430, 2002; Liu et al., Microsurgery, 27:300-304; 2007) and in a study using human islet cells to evidence no detrimental effects on human islet function (Truong et al., American Journal of Transplantation, 7:2031-2038, 2007). FTY720 has been reported to reduce the nociceptive behavior in the spared nerve injury model for neuropathic pain which does not depend on prostaglandin synthesis (O. Costu et al, Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine 12(3), 995-1004, 2008). FTY720 has been reported to impair initiation of murine contact hypersensitivity (CHS). Adoptive transfer of immunized lymph node cells from mice treated with FTY720 during the sensitization phase was virtually incapable of inducing CHS response in recipients (D. Nakashima et al., J. Investigative Dermatology (128(12), 2833-2841, 2008). It has been reported that prophylactic oral administration of FTY720 (1 mg/kg, three times a week), completely prevented the development of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) in C57BL/6 mice (T. Kohono et al, Biological & Pharmaceutical Bulletin, 28(4), 736-739, 2005). In one embodiment, the present invention encompasses compounds which are agonists of the S1P1 receptor having selectivity over the S1P3 receptor. The S1P3 receptor, and not the S1P1 receptor, has been directly implicated in bradycardia (Sanna et al., J. Biol. Chem., 279:13839-13848, 2004). An S1P1 receptor agonist selective over at least the S1P3 receptor has advantages over current therapies by virtue of an enhanced therapeutic window, allowing better tolerability with higher dosing and thus improving efficacy as therapy. The present invention encompasses compounds which are agonists of the S1P1 receptor and which exhibit no or substantially no activity for bradycardia. S1P1 receptor agonists are useful to treat or prevent conditions where suppression of the immune system or agonism of the S1P1 receptor is in order, such as diseases and disorders mediated by lymphocytes, transplant rejection, autoimmune diseases and disorders, inflammatory diseases and disorders, and conditions that have an underlying defect in vascular integrity or that relate to angiogenesis such as may be pathologic. In one embodiment, the present invention encompasses compounds which are agonists of the S1P1 receptor having good overall physical properties and biological activities and having an effectiveness that is substantially at least that of prior compounds with activity at the S1P1 receptor. Citation of any reference throughout this application is not to be construed as an admission that such reference is prior art to the present application.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF TEE INVENTION Definitions For clarity and consistency, the following definitions will be used throughout this patent document. The term “agonist” is intended to mean a moiety that interacts with and activates a G-protein-coupled receptor, such as the S1P1 receptor, such as can thereby initiate a physiological or pharmacological response characteristic of that receptor. For example, an agonist activities an intracellular response upon binding to the receptor, or enhances GTP binding to a membrane. In certain embodiments, an agonist of the invention is an S1P1 receptor agonist that is capable of facilitating sustained S1P1 receptor internalization (see e.g., Matloubian et al., Nature, 427, 355, 2004). The term “antagonist” is intended to mean a moiety that competitively binds to the receptor at the same site as an agonist (for example, the endogenous ligand), but which does not activate the intracellular response initiated by the active form of the receptor and can thereby inhibit the intracellular responses by an agonist or partial agonist. An antagonist does not diminish the baseline intracellular response in the absence of an agonist or partial agonist. The term “hydrate” as used herein means a compound of the invention or a salt thereof, that further includes a stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amount of water bound by non-covalent intermolecular forces. The term “solvate” as used herein means a compound of the invention or a salt, thereof, that further includes a stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amount of a solvent bound by non-covalent intermolecular forces. Preferred solvents are volatile, non-toxic, and/or acceptable for administration to humans in trace amounts. The term “in need of treatment” and the term “in need thereof” when referring to treatment are used interchangeably to mean a judgment made by a caregiver (e.g. physician, nurse, nurse practitioner, etc. in the case of humans; veterinarian in the case of animals, including non-human mammals) that an individual or animal requires or will benefit from treatment. This judgment is made based on a variety of factors that are in the realm of a caregiver's expertise, but that includes the knowledge that the individual or animal is ill, or will become ill, as the result of a disease, condition or disorder that is treatable by the compounds of the invention. Accordingly, the compounds of the invention can be used in a protective or preventive manner; or compounds of the invention can be used to alleviate, inhibit or ameliorate the disease, condition or disorder. The term “individual” is intended to mean any animal, including mammals, preferably mice, rats, other rodents, rabbits, dogs, cats, swine, cattle, sheep, horses, or primates and most preferably humans. The term “inverse agonist” is intended to mean a moiety that binds to the endogenous form of the receptor or to the constitutively activated form of the receptor and which inhibits the baseline intracellular response initiated by the active form of the receptor below the normal base level of activity which is observed in the absence of an agonist or partial agonist, or decreases GTP binding to a membrane. In some embodiments, the baseline intracellular response is inhibited in the presence of the inverse agonist by at least 30%. In some embodiments, the baseline intracellular response is inhibited in the presence of the inverse agonist by at least 50%. In some embodiments, the baseline intracellular response is inhibited in the presence of the inverse agonist by at least 75%, as compared with the baseline response in the absence of the inverse agonist. The term “modulate or modulating” is intended to mean an increase or decrease in the amount, quality, response or effect of a particular activity, function or molecule. The term “pharmaceutical composition” is intended to mean a composition comprising at least one active ingredient; including but not limited to, salts, solvates, and hydrates of compounds of the present invention, whereby the composition is amenable to investigation for a specified, efficacious outcome in a mammal (for example, without limitation, a human). Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand and appreciate the techniques appropriate for determining whether an active ingredient has a desired efficacious outcome based upon the needs of the artisan. The term “therapeutically effective amount” is intended to mean the amount of active compound or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or medicinal response in a tissue, system, animal, individual or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician, caregiver or by an individual, which includes one or more of the following: (1) Preventing the disease, for example, preventing a disease, condition or disorder in an individual that may be predisposed to the disease, condition or disorder but does not yet experience or display the pathology or symptomatology of the disease; (2) Inhibiting the disease, for example, inhibiting a disease, condition or disorder in an individual that is experiencing or displaying the pathology or symptomatology of the disease, condition or disorder (i.e., arresting further development of the pathology and/or symptomatology); and (3) Ameliorating the disease, for example, ameliorating a disease, condition or disorder in an individual that is experiencing or displaying the pathology or symptomatology of the disease, condition or disorder (i.e., reversing the pathology and/or symptomatology).

Additionally, individual compounds and chemical genera of the present invention, for example, those compounds found in Table A including diastereomers and enantiomers thereof, encompass all pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, and hydrates, thereof. It is understood that the present invention embraces each diastereomer, each enantiomer and mixtures thereof of each compound and generic formulae disclosed herein just as if they were each individually disclosed with the specific stereochemical designation for each chiral carbon. Separation of the individual isomers (such as, by chiral HPLC, recrystallization of diastereomeric mixtures, and the like) or selective synthesis (such as, by enantiomeric selective syntheses and the like) of the individual isomers is accomplished by application of various methods which are well known to practitioners in the art. The compounds of the Formula (Ia) of the present invention may be prepared according to relevant published literature procedures that are used by one skilled in the art. Exemplary reagents and procedures for these reactions appear hereinafter in the working examples. Protection and deprotection may be carried out by procedures generally known in the art (see, for example, Greene, T. W. and Wuts, P. G. M., Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Edition, 1999 [Wiley]; incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Pharmaceutical Compositions A further aspect of the present invention pertains to pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more compounds as described herein and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Some embodiments pertain to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Some embodiments of the present invention include a method of producing a pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing at least one compound according to any of the compound embodiments disclosed herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Formulations may be prepared by any suitable method, typically by uniformly mixing the active compound(s) with liquids or finely divided solid carriers, or both, in the required proportions and then, if necessary, forming the resulting mixture into a desired shape. Conventional excipients, such as binding agents, fillers, acceptable wetting agents, tabletting lubricants and disintegrants may be used in tablets and capsules for oral administration. Liquid preparations for oral administration may be in the form of solutions, emulsions, aqueous or oily suspensions and syrups. Alternatively, the oral preparations may be in the form of dry powder that can be reconstituted with water or another suitable liquid vehicle before use. Additional additives such as suspending or emulsifying agents, non-aqueous vehicles (including edible oils), preservatives and flavorings and colorants may be added to the liquid preparations. Parenteral dosage forms may be prepared by dissolving the compound of the invention in a suitable liquid vehicle and filter sterilizing the solution before filling and sealing an appropriate vial or ampule. These are just a few examples of the many appropriate methods well known in the art for preparing dosage forms. A compound of the present invention can be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions using techniques well known to those in the art. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, outside those mentioned herein, are known in the art; for example, see Remington, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th Edition, 2000, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, (Editors: Gennaro et al.) While it is possible that, for use in the prophylaxis or treatment, a compound of the invention may, in an alternative use, be administered as a raw or pure chemical, it is preferable however to present the compound or active ingredient as a pharmaceutical formulation or composition further comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The invention thus further provides pharmaceutical formulations comprising a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate or derivative thereof together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers thereof and/or prophylactic ingredients. The carrier(s) must be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not overly deleterious to the recipient thereof. Pharmaceutical formulations include those suitable for oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sub-lingual), vaginal or parenteral (including intramuscular, subcutaneous and intravenous) administration or in a form suitable for administration by inhalation, insufflation or by a transdermal patch. Transdermal patches dispense a drug at a controlled rate by presenting the drug for absorption in an efficient manner with a minimum of degradation of the drug. Typically, transdermal patches comprise an impermeable backing layer, a single pressure sensitive adhesive and a removable protective layer with a release liner. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand and appreciate the techniques appropriate for manufacturing a desired efficacious transdermal patch based upon the needs of the artisan. The compounds of the invention, together with a conventional adjuvant, carrier, or diluent, may thus be placed into the form of pharmaceutical formulations and unit dosages thereof and in such form may be employed as solids, such as tablets or filled capsules, or liquids such as solutions, suspensions, emulsions, elixirs, gels or capsules filled with the same, all for oral use; in the form of suppositories for rectal administration; or in the form of sterile injectable solutions for parenteral (including subcutaneous) use. Such pharmaceutical compositions and unit dosage forms thereof may comprise conventional ingredients in conventional proportions, with or without additional active compounds or principles and such unit dosage forms may contain any suitable effective amount of the active ingredient commensurate with the intended daily dosage range to be employed. For oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition may be in the form of, for example, a tablet, capsule, suspension or liquid. The pharmaceutical composition is preferably made in the form of a dosage unit containing a particular amount of the active ingredient. Examples of such dosage units are capsules, tablets, powders, granules or suspensions, with conventional additives such as lactose, mannitol, corn starch or potato starch; with binders such as crystalline cellulose, cellulose derivatives, acacia, corn starch or gelatins; with disintegrators such as corn starch, potato starch or sodium carboxymethyl-cellulose; and with lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate. The active ingredient may also be administered by injection as a composition wherein, for example, saline, dextrose or water may be used as a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Compounds of the present invention or a salt, solvate, hydrate or physiologically functional derivative thereof can be used as active ingredients in pharmaceutical compositions, specifically as S1P1 receptor modulators. The term “active ingredient” is defined in the context of a “pharmaceutical composition” and is intended to mean a component of a pharmaceutical composition that provides the primary pharmacological effect, as opposed to an “inactive ingredient” which would generally be recognized as providing no pharmaceutical benefit. The dose when using the compounds of the present invention can vary within wide limits and as is customary and known to the physician, it is to be tailored to the individual conditions in each individual case. It depends, for example, on the nature and severity of the illness to be treated, on the condition of the patient, on the compound employed or on whether an acute or chronic disease state is treated or prophylaxis is conducted or on whether further active compounds are administered in addition to the compounds of the present invention. Representative doses of the present invention include, but are not limited to, about 0.001 mg to about 5000 mg, about 0.001 mg to about 2500 mg, about 0.001 mg to about 1000 mg, 0.001 mg to about 500 mg, 0.001 mg to about 250 mg, about 0.001 mg to 100 mg, about 0.001 mg to about 50 mg and about 0.001 mg to about 25 mg. Multiple doses may be administered during the day, especially when relatively large amounts are deemed to be needed, for example 2, 3 or 4 doses. Depending on the individual and as deemed appropriate by the patient's physician or caregiver it may be necessary to deviate upward or downward from the doses described herein. The amount of active ingredient or an active salt, solvate or hydrate derivative thereof; required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular salt selected but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being treated and the age and condition of the patient and will ultimately be at the discretion of the attendant physician or clinician. In general, one skilled in the art understands how to extrapolate in vivo data obtained in one model system, typically an animal model, to another, such as a human. In some circumstances, these extrapolations may merely be based on the weight of the animal model in comparison to another, such as a mammal, preferably a human, however, more often, these extrapolations are not simply based on weights, but rather incorporate a variety of factors. Representative factors include the type, age, weight, sex, diet and medical condition of the patient, the severity of the disease, the route of administration, pharmacological considerations such as the activity, efficacy, pharmacokinetic and toxicology profiles of the particular compound employed, whether a drug delivery system is utilized, whether an acute or chronic disease state is being treated or prophylaxis is conducted or whether further active compounds are administered in addition to the compounds of the present invention and as part of a drug combination. The dosage regimen for treating a disease condition with the compounds and/or compositions of this invention is selected in accordance with a variety factors including those cited above. Thus, the actual dosage regimen employed may vary widely and therefore may deviate from a preferred dosage regimen and one skilled in the art will recognize that dosage and dosage regimens outside these typical ranges can be tested and, where appropriate, may be used in the methods of this invention. The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as 2, 3, 4 or more sub-doses per day. The sub-dose itself may be further divided, e.g., into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations. The daily dose can be divided, especially when relatively large amounts are administered as deemed appropriate, into several, for example 2, 3 or 4 part administrations. If appropriate, depending on individual behavior, it may be necessary to deviate upward or downward from the daily dose indicated. For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds of the present invention, the suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier can be either solid, liquid or a mixture of both. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, pills, capsules, cachets, suppositories and dispersible granules. A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as diluents, flavoring agents, solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders, preservatives, tablet disintegrating agents, or encapsulating materials. In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in a mixture with the finely divided active component. In tablets, the active component is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding capacity in suitable proportions and compacted to the desired shape and size. The powders and tablets may contain varying percentage amounts of the active compound. A representative amount in a powder or tablet may be from 0.5 to about 90 percent of the active compound. However, an artisan would know when amounts outside of this range are necessary. Suitable carriers for powders and tablets include magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter and the like. The term “preparation” is intended to include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as carrier providing a capsule in which the active component, with or without carriers, is surrounded by a carrier, which is thus in association with it. Similarly, cachets and lozenges are included. Tablets, powders, capsules, pills, cachets and lozenges can be used as solid forms suitable for oral administration. For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax, such as an admixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter, is first melted and the active component is dispersed homogeneously therein (e.g., by stirring). The molten homogenous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool and thereby to solidify. Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or sprays containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate. Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions and emulsions, for example, water or water-propylene glycol solutions. For example, parenteral injection liquid preparations can be formulated as solutions in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution. Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. The compounds according to the present invention may thus be formulated for parenteral administration (e.g. by injection, for example bolus injection or continuous infusion) and may be presented in unit dose form in ampoules, pre-filled syringes, small volume infusion or in multi-dose containers with an added preservative. The pharmaceutical compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form, obtained by aseptic isolation of sterile solid or by lyophilization from solution, for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile, pyrogen-free water, before use. Aqueous formulations suitable for oral use can be prepared by dissolving or suspending the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavors, stabilizing and thickening agents, as desired. Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water with viscous material, such as natural or synthetic gums, resins, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, or other well-known suspending agents. Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for oral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. These preparations may contain, in addition to the active component, colorants, flavors, stabilizers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners, dispersants, thickeners, solubilizing agents and the like. For topical administration to the epidermis the compounds according to the invention may be formulated as ointments, creams or lotions, or as a transdermal patch. Ointments and creams may, for example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily base with the addition of suitable thickening and/or gelling agents. Lotions may be formulated with an aqueous or oily base and will in general also contain one or more emulsifying agents, stabilizing agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, or coloring agents. Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the active agent in a flavored base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier. Solutions or suspensions are applied directly to the nasal cavity by conventional means, for example with a dropper, pipette or spray. The formulations may be provided in single or multi-dose form. In the latter case of a dropper or pipette, this may be achieved by the patient administering an appropriate, predetermined volume of the solution or suspension. In the case of a spray, this may be achieved for example by means of a metering atomizing spray pump. Administration to the respiratory tract may also be achieved by means of an aerosol formulation in which the active ingredient is provided in a pressurized pack with a suitable propellant. If the compounds of the present invention or pharmaceutical compositions comprising them are administered as aerosols (e.g., nasal aerosols, by inhalation), this can be carried out, for example, using a spray, a nebulizer, a pump nebulizer, an inhalation apparatus, a metered inhaler or a dry powder inhaler. Pharmaceutical forms for administration of the compounds of the present invention as an aerosol can be prepared by processes well known to the person skilled in the art. Solutions or dispersions of the compounds of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate or derivative thereof in water, water/alcohol mixtures or suitable saline solutions, for example, can be employed using customary additives (e.g., benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives), absorption enhancers for increasing the bioavailability, solubilizers, dispersants and others and, if appropriate, customary propellants (e.g., carbon dioxide, CFCs, such as, dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane and the like). The aerosol may conveniently also contain a surfactant such as lecithin. The dose of drug may be controlled by provision of a metered valve. In formulations intended for administration to the respiratory tract, including intranasal formulations, the compound will generally have a small particle size for example of the order of 10 microns or less. Such a particle size may be obtained by means known in the art, for example by micronization. When desired, formulations adapted to give sustained release of the active ingredient may be employed. Alternatively the active ingredients may be provided in the form of a dry powder (e.g., a powder mix of the compound in a suitable powder base such as lactose, starch, starch derivatives such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)). Conveniently the powder carrier will form a gel in the nasal cavity. The powder composition may be presented in unit dose form (e.g., capsules, cartridges) as for gelatin or blister packs from which the powder may be administered by means of an inhaler. The pharmaceutical preparations are preferably in unit dosage forms. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules and powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form. In some embodiments, the compositions are tablets or capsules for oral administration. In some embodiments, the compositions are liquids for intravenous administration. The compounds according to the invention may optionally exist as pharmaceutically acceptable salts including pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acids including inorganic and organic acids. Representative acids include, but are not limited to, acetic, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, camphorsulfonic, citric, ethenesulfonic, dichloroacetic, formic, fumaric, gluconic, glutamic, hippuric, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, isethionic, lactic, maleic, malic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, mucic, nitric, oxalic, pamoic, pantothenic, phosphoric, succinic, sulfuric, tartaric, oxalic, p-toluenesulfonic and the like, such as those pharmaceutically acceptable salts listed by Berge et al., Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences, 66:1-19 (1977), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The acid addition salts may be obtained as the direct products of compound synthesis. In the alternative, the free base may be dissolved in a suitable solvent containing the appropriate acid and the salt isolated by evaporating the solvent or otherwise separating the salt and solvent. The compounds of this invention may form solvates with standard low molecular weight solvents using methods known to the skilled artisan. Compounds of the present invention can be converted to “pro-drugs.” The term “pro-drugs” refers to compounds that have been modified with specific chemical groups known in the art and that when administered into an individual undergo biotransformation to give the parent compound. Pro-drugs can thus be viewed as compounds of the invention containing one or more specialized non-toxic protective groups used in a transient manner to alter or to eliminate a property of the compound. In one general aspect, the “pro-drug” approach is utilized to facilitate oral absorption. A thorough discussion is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series; and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Some embodiments of the present invention include a method of producing a pharmaceutical composition for “combination-therapy” comprising admixing at least one compound according to any of the compound embodiments disclosed herein, together with at least one known pharmaceutical agent as described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. It is noted that when S1P1 receptor agonists are utilized as active ingredients in a pharmaceutical composition, these are not intended for use only in humans, but in other non-human mammals as well. Indeed, recent advances in the area of animal health-care mandate that consideration be given for the use of active agents, such as S1P1 receptor agonists, for the treatment of an S1P1 receptor-associated disease or disorder in companionship animals (e.g., cats, dogs, etc.) and in livestock animals (e.g., cows, chickens, fish, etc.). Those of ordinary skill in the art are readily credited with understanding the utility of such compounds in such settings. Hydrates and Solvates It is understood that when the phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and hydrates” is used when referring to a particular formula herein, it is intended to embrace solvates and/or hydrates of compounds of the particular formula, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of the particular formula as well as solvates and/or hydrates of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of the particular formula. The compounds of the present invention can be administrated in a wide variety of oral and parenteral dosage forms. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the following dosage forms may comprise, as the active component, either a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or as a solvate or hydrate thereof. Moreover, various hydrates and solvates of the compounds of the invention and their salts will find use as intermediates in the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions. Typical procedures for making and identifying suitable hydrates and solvates, outside those mentioned herein, are well known to those in the art; see for example, pages 202-209 of K. J. Guillory, “Generation of Polymorphs, Hydrates, Solvates, and Amorphous Solids,” in: Polymorphism in Pharmaceutical Solids, ed. Harry G. Brittan, Vol. 95, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1999, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention pertains to hydrates and solvates of compounds of Formula (I) and (Ia), or Formula (II) and (IIa) and/or their pharmaceutical acceptable salts, as described herein, that can be isolated and characterized by methods known in the art, such as, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), TGA-mass spectroscopy, TGA-Infrared spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction (XRPD), Karl Fisher titration, high resolution X-ray diffraction, and the like. There are several commercial entities that provide quick and efficient services for identifying solvates and hydrates on a routine basis. Example companies offering these services include Wilmington PharmaTech (Wilmington, Del.), Avantium Technologies (Amsterdam) and Aptuit (Greenwich, Conn.). Other Utilities Another object of the present invention relates to radiolabeled compounds of the present invention that are useful not only in radio-imaging but also in assays, both in vitro and in vivo, for localizing and quantitating the S1P1 receptor in tissue samples, including human and for identifying S1P1 receptor ligands by inhibition binding of a radiolabeled compound. It is a further object of this invention to develop novel S1P1 receptor assays which comprise such radiolabeled compounds. The present invention embraces isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention. Isotopically or radiolabeled compounds are those which are identical to compounds disclosed herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced or substituted by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number most commonly found in nature. Suitable radionuclides that may be incorporated in compounds of the present invention include, but are not limited, to 2H (also written as D for deuterium), 3H (also written as T for tritium), 14C, 13N, 14N, 15O, 17O, 18O, 18F, 35S, 36Cl, 75Br, 76Br, 77Br, 82Br, 123I, 124I, 125I and 131I. The radionuclide that is incorporated in the instant radiolabeled compounds will depend on the specific application of that radiolabeled compound. For example, for in vitro S1P1 receptor labeling and competition assays, compounds that incorporate 3H, 14C, 82Br, 128I, 131I or 35S will generally be most useful. For radio-imaging applications 11C, 18F, 125I, 123I, 124I, 131I, 75Br, 76Br or 77Br will generally be most useful. It is understood that a “radiolabeled” or “labeled compound” is a compound as described herein, for example, a compound found in Formula (I), (Ia), (Ic), (Ie), (Ig), (Ik), (Im), (IIa), (IIb), (IIc), (IId), (IIe), (IIf), (IIg), (IIh), or (IIi), or compound of Table A, containing at least one radionuclide. In some embodiments the radionuclide is selected from the group consisting of 3H, 14C, 125I, 35S, and 82Br. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention are useful in compound and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. In some embodiments the radionuclide 3H and/or 14C isotopes are useful in these studies. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., 2H) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in FIGS. 1 to 10 and examples infra, by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent. Other synthetic methods that are useful are discussed infra. Moreover, it should be understood that all of the atoms represented in the compounds of the invention can be either the most commonly occurring isotope of such atoms or a scarcer radio-isotope or nonradioactive isotope. Synthetic methods for incorporating radio-isotopes into organic compounds are applicable to compounds of the invention and are well known in the art. Certain synthetic methods, for example, for incorporating activity levels of tritium into target molecules, are as follows: A. Catalytic Reduction with Tritium Gas: This procedure normally yields high specific activity products and requires halogenated or unsaturated precursors. B. Reduction with Sodium Borohydride [3H]: This procedure is rather inexpensive and requires precursors containing reducible functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, lactones, esters and the like. C. Reduction with Lithium Aluminum Hydride [3H]: This procedure offers products at almost theoretical specific activities. It also requires precursors containing reducible functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, lactones, esters, and the like. D. Tritium Gas Exposure Labeling: This procedure involves exposing precursors containing exchangeable protons to tritium gas in the presence of a suitable catalyst. E. N-Methylation using Methyl Iodide [3H]: This procedure is usually employed to prepare O-methyl or N-methyl [3H] products by treating appropriate precursors with high specific activity methyl iodide [3H]. This method in general allows for higher specific activity, such as for example, about 70-90 Ci/mmol. Synthetic methods for incorporating activity levels of 125I into target molecules include: A. Sandmeyer and like reactions: This procedure transforms an aryl amine or a heteroaryl amine into a diazonium salt, such as a diazonium tetrafluoroborate salt and subsequently to 125I labeled compound using Na125I. A represented procedure was reported by Zhu, G-D. and co-workers in J. Org. Chem., 2002, 67, 943-948. B. Ortho 125Iodination of phenols: This procedure allows for the incorporation of 125I at the ortho position of a phenol as reported by Collier, T. L. and co-workers in J. Labelled Compd. Radiopharm., 1999, 42, S264-S266. C. Aryl and heteroaryl bromide exchange with 125I: This method is generally a two step process. The first step is the conversion of the aryl or heteroaryl bromide to the corresponding tri-alkyltin intermediate using for example, a Pd catalyzed reaction [i.e. Pd(Ph3P)4] or through an aryl or heteroaryl lithium, in the presence of a tri-allcyltinhalide or hexaalkylditin [e.g., (CH3)3SnSn(CH3)3]. A representative procedure was reported by Le Bas, M.-D. and co-workers in J. Labelled Compd. Radiopharm. 2001, 44, S280-S282. A radiolabeled S1P1 receptor compound of Formula (I) or (Ia), or Formula (IIa) or (IIa) can be used in a screening assay to identify/evaluate compounds. In general terms, a newly synthesized or identified compound (i.e., test compound) can be evaluated for its ability to reduce binding of the “radiolabeled compound of Formula (I) or (Ia), or Formula (IIa) or (IIa)” to the S1P1 receptor. Accordingly, the ability of a test compound to compete with the “radiolabeled compound of Formula (I) or (Ia), or Formula (IIa) or (IIa)” for the binding to the S1P1 receptor directly correlates to its binding affinity. The labeled compounds of the present invention bind to the S1P1 receptor. In one embodiment the labeled compound has an IC50 less than about 500 μM, in another embodiment the labeled compound has an IC50 less than about 100 μM, in yet another embodiment the labeled compound has an IC50 less than about 10 in yet another embodiment the labeled compound has an IC50 less than about 1 μM and in still yet another embodiment the labeled inhibitor has an IC50 less than about 0.1 μM. Other uses of the disclosed receptors and methods will become apparent to those of skill in the art based upon, inter alfa, a review of this disclosure. As will be recognized, the steps of the methods of the present invention need not be performed any particular number of times or in any particular sequence. Additional objects, advantages and novel features of this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following examples thereof, which are intended to be illustrative and not intended to be limiting.

HTRF® assay also was used to determine EC50 values for S1P1 receptor agonists. Principle of the Assay: HTRF® assay kit was purchased from Cisbio-US, Inc. (Bedford, Mass.; Catalog #62AM4PEC). The HTRF® assay supported by the kit is a competitive immunoassay between endogenous cAMP produced by the CHO-K1 cells and tracer cAMP labeled with the dye d2. The tracer binding is visualized by a monoclonal anti-cAMP antibody labeled with Cryptate. The specific signal (i.e., fluorescence resonance energy transfer, FRET) is inversely proportional to the concentration of unlabeled cAMP in the standard or sample. Standard Curve: The fluorescence ratio (665 nm/620 nm) of the standards (0.17 to 712 nM cAMP) included in the assay was calculated and used to generate a cAMP standard curve according to the kit manufacturer's instructions. The fluorescence ratio of the samples (test compound or compound buffer) was calculated and used to deduce respective cAMP concentrations by reference to the cAMP standard curve. Setup of the Assay: The HTRF® assay was carried out using a two-step protocol essentially according to the kit manufacturer's instructions, in 20 μL total volume per well in 384-well plate format (ProxiPlates; PerkinElmer, Fremont, Calif.; catalog #6008280). To each of the experimental wells was transferred 1500 recombinant CHO-K1 cells in 5 pt phosphate buffered saline containing calcium chloride and magnesium chloride (PBS+; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.; catalog #14040) supplemented with IBMX (250 μM) and rolipram (20 μM) (phosphodiesterase inhibitors; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.; catalog #15879 and catalog # R6520, respectively), followed by test compound in 5 μL compound buffer (PBS+ supplemented with 10 pit NKH477 (water-soluble forskolin derivative; SignaGen Laboratories, Gaithersburg, Md.; catalog # PKI-NKH477-010)) or 5 μL compound buffer. The plate was then incubated at room temperature for 1 h. To each well was then added 5 μL cAMP-d2 conjugate in lysis buffer and 5 μL Cryptate conjugate in lysis buffer according to the kit manufacturer's instructions. The plate was then further incubated at room temperature for 1 hour, after which the assay plate was read. Assay Readout: HTRF® readout was accomplished using a PHERAstar (BMG LABTECH Inc., Durham, N.C.) or EnVision™ (PerkinElmer, Fremont Calif.) microplate reader. Certain compounds of the present invention and their corresponding activity values are shown in Table B. TABLE B Compound No. EC50 S1P1 (HTRF ®) 4 321 pM 6 239 pM 10 11 pM 11 5.2 nM 14 6.3 nM Certain other compounds of the invention had activity values ranging from about 11 pM to about 6.3 nM in this assay. Example 3 Cellular/Functional Ca2+ Assay for Agonist Activity on S1P3 Receptor A compound of the invention can be shown to have no or substantially no agonist activity on the S1P3 receptor by using in assay a human neuroblastoma cell line which endogenously expresses S1P3 (predominantly), S1P2 and S1P5 receptors, but not S1P1 or S1P4 receptors, based on mRNA analysis (Villullas et al., J. Neurosci. Res., 73:215-226, 2003). Of these, S1P3 and S1P2 receptors respond to agonists, such as S1P, with an intracellular calcium increase. No or substantially no increase of intracellular calcium in response to a test compound is indicative of the test compound exhibiting no or substantially no agonist activity on the S1P3 receptor. Such an assay can be performed commercially, e.g. by Caliper LifeSciences (Hopkinton, Mass.). Assay: The human neuroblastoma cells are washed and resuspended in physiological buffer. The cells are then loaded with dye that measures intracellular calcium. S1P is used as a reference agonist. After addition of S1P or a test compound, fluorescence is measured at 485 nm excitation/525 nm emission every 2 s for at least 60 s. Calcium ionophore A23187 is then added as an internal positive control. Example 4 Effect of Compounds in Peripheral Lymphocyte Lowering (PLL) Assay A compound of the invention can be shown to induce peripheral lymphocyte lowering (PLL). A. Mouse PLL Assay. Animals: Male BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, Mass.) were housed four per cage and maintained in a humidity-controlled (40 to 60%) and temperature-controlled (68 to 72° F.) facility on a 12 h:12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 6:30 am) with free access to food (Harlan Teklad, Orange, Calif., Rodent Diet 8604) and water. Mice were allowed one week of habituation to the animal facility before testing. PLL Assay: Mice were given an oral dose of Compound 2 or dosing vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose) in a total volume of 10 mL/kg. Peripheral blood samples were collected at 5 hours post-dose. The mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and blood was collected via cardiac puncture. A complete cell count (CBC), including lymphocyte count, was obtained using a CELL-DYN® 3700 (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Ill.) instrument. Results are presented in FIG. 11, in which peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) count is shown for the 5 hour group. Reduction of the PBL count by the test compound in comparison with vehicle is indicative of the test compound exhibiting activity or inducing peripheral lymphocyte lowering. It is apparent from inspection of FIG. 11 that Compound 2 exhibited activity for inducing PBL lowering (lymphopenia) in the mouse. B. Rat PLL Assay. Animals: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Hollister, Calif.) were housed and maintained in humidity (40 to 60%) and temperature (68 to 72° F.) controlled facility on a 12 h:12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 6:30 am) with free access to food (Harlan Teklad, Orange, Calif., Rodent Diet 8604) and water. Rats were allowed (approximately) one week of habituation to the animal facility before testing. PLL Assay: Rats were given a 1 mg/kg intravenous dose of the first enantiomer isolated after resolution of compound 12 by HPLC (retention time: 15 min per the conditions reported in Example 1.3), or dosing vehicle (40% hydroxypropyl-cyclodextrin (HPCD)) in a total volume of 1 mL/kg. Peripheral blood samples were collected at 5 h post-dose. Blood was collected via indwelling catheter. A complete cell count (CBC), including lymphocyte count, was obtained using a CELL-DYN® 3700 (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Ill.) instrument. Results are presented in FIG. 12, in which peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) count is shown for the 5 hour group. Reduction of the PBL count by the test compound in comparison with vehicle is indicative of the test compound exhibiting activity or inducing peripheral lymphocyte lowering. It is apparent from inspection of FIG. 12 that the first enantiomer isolated after resolution of compound 12 by HPLC exhibited activity for inducing PBL lowering (lymphopenia) in the rat. Similarly, rats were given a 1 mg/kg intravenous dose of the second enantiomer isolated after resolution of compound 12 by HPLC (retention time: 18 min per the conditions reported in Example 1.3), or dosing vehicle (40% hydroxypropyl-cyclodextrin (HPCD)) in a total volume of 1 mL/kg. Peripheral blood samples were collected at 5 h post-dose. Blood was collected via indwelling catheter. A complete cell count (CBC), including lymphocyte count, was obtained using a CELL-DYN® 3700 (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Ill.) instrument. Results are presented in FIG. 13, in which peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) count is shown for the 5 hour group. Reduction of the PBL count by the test compound in comparison with vehicle is indicative of the test compound exhibiting activity or inducing peripheral lymphocyte lowering. It is apparent from inspection of FIG. 13 that the second enantiomer isolated after resolution of compound 12 by HPLC exhibited activity for inducing PBL lowering (lymphopenia) in the rat. Example 5 Effect of Compounds on Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) A compound of the invention can be shown to have therapeutic efficacy in multiple sclerosis by showing it to have therapeutic efficacy in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for multiple sclerosis. In certain exemplary well-established models, EAE is induced in rodents by injection of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide, by injection of myelin basic protein (MBP) or by injection of proteolipid protein (PLP) peptide. A. MOG-Induced EAE in Mice. Animals: Female C57BL/6 mice (8 to 10 weeks of age at start of study) (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Me.) are housed four per cage and maintained in a humidity-controlled (40-60%) and temperature-controlled (68-72° F.) facility on a 12 h:12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 6:30 am) with free access to food (Harlan Teklad, Orange, Calif., Rodent Diet 8604) and water. Mice are allowed one week of habituation to the animal facility before testing. Induction of EAE: Mice are immunized subcutaneously, 50 μL per hind flank, with a total of 100 μg MOG35-55 peptide emulsified 1:1 with complete Freund's adjuvant containing 4 mg/mL heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Mice also receive 200 ng pertussis toxin intraperitoneally on the day of immunization and 48 h later. Clinical Scoring: Severity of disease symptoms is scored as follows (in increasing order of severity): 0=normal; 1=limp tail OR hind limb weakness; 2=limp tail AND limb weakness/weakness of 2 or more limbs; 3=severe limb weakness or single limb paralysis; 4=paralysis of 2 or more limbs; 5=death. Drug Treatment: Mice are dosed orally, with vehicle or a test compound, once a day from day 3 until day 21. Dosing volume is 5 mL/kg. The test compound is dosed at, e.g., 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg. Mice are weighed daily. Mice are monitored daily from day 7 onward for disease symptoms. After the last dose on day 21, disease progression is monitored daily for 2 more weeks. Reduction of the severity of disease symptoms by the test compound in comparison with vehicle is indicative of the test compound exhibiting therapeutic efficacy in EAE. B. PLP-Induced EAE in Mice. Animals: Female SJL/J mice (8 to 10 weeks of age at start of study) (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Me.) are housed four per cage and maintained in a humidity-controlled (40-60%) and temperature-controlled (68-72° F.) facility on a 12 h:12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 6:30 am) with free access to food (Harlan-Teklad Western Res, Orange, Calif., Rodent Diet 8604) and water. Mice are allowed one week of habituation to the animal facility before testing. Induction of EAE: Mice are immunized subcutaneously with 100 μg PLP139-151 peptide emulsified 1:1 with complete Freund's adjuvant containing 4 mg/mL heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Mice also receive 200 ng pertussis toxin intravenously on the day of immunization. Clinical Scoring: Severity of disease symptoms is scored as follows (in increasing order of severity): 0=normal; 1=limp tail OR hind limb weakness; 2=limp tail AND limb weakness/weakness of 2 or more limbs; 3=severe limb weakness or single limb paralysis; 4=paralysis of 2 or more limbs; 5=death. Drug Treatment: Mice are dosed orally, with vehicle or a test compound, once a day from day 3 until day 21. Dosing volume is 5 ml/kg. The test compound is dosed at, e.g., 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg. Mice are weighed daily. Mice are monitored daily from day 7 onward for disease symptoms. After the last dose on day 21, disease progression is monitored daily for two more weeks. C. MBP-Induced EAE in Rats. Animals: Male Lewis rats (325-375 g at start of study) (Harlan, San Diego, Calif.) are housed two per cage and maintained in a humidity-controlled (30-70%) and temperature-controlled (20-22° C.) facility on a 12 h:12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 6:30 A.M.) with free access to food (Harlan-Teklad Western Res., Orange, Calif., Rodent Diet 8604) and water. Rats are allowed one week of habituation to the animal facility before testing. During the study, rats are weighed daily prior to clinical scoring at 11 am. Induction of EAE: Myelin basic protein (MBP; guinea pig) is dissolved in sterile saline at a concentration of 1 mg/ml, and then emulsified 1:1 with complete Freund's adjuvant (1 mg/ml). 50 μL of this emulsion is administered by intraplantar (ipl) injection into both hind paws of each rat, for a total injected volume of 100 μL per rat and a total dose of 50 μg of MBP per rat. Clinical Scoring: Severity of disease symptoms is scored daily after body weighing and before drug dosing. Severity of disease symptoms is scored as follows (in increasing order of severity): 0=normal; 1=tail OR limb weakness; 2=tail AND limb weakness; 3=severe hind limb weakness or single limb paralysis; 4=loss of tail tone and paralysis of 2 or more limbs; 5=death. Drug Treatment: Rats are dosed orally, with vehicle or a test compound, 1 hour prior to MBP injection on day 0 and daily thereafter, after clinical scoring, for the duration of the study. Dosing volume is 5 mL/kg. The test compound is dosed at, e.g., 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg. Reduction of the severity of disease symptoms by the test compound in comparison with vehicle is indicative of the test compound exhibiting therapeutic efficacy in EAE. Example 6 Effect of Compounds on Type I Diabetes A compound of the invention can be shown to have therapeutic efficacy in type I diabetes using an animal model for type I diabetes, such as cyclophosphamide-induced type I diabetes in mice. Animals: Baseline blood glucose measurements are taken from 9-10 week old female NOD/Ltj mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Me.) to ensure that they are normoglycemic (blood glucose is 80-120 mg/dL) prior to initiation of the experiment. Blood glucose is measured from tail bleeds using a OneTouch® Ultra® meter and test strips (LifeScan, Milpitas, Calif.). Cyclophosphamide Induction of Type I Diabetes: On day 0 and day 14, normoglycemic NOD mice are injected intraperitoneally with 4 mg cyclophosphamide monohydrate (200 mg/kg) dissolved in 0.9% saline. If mice are diabetic (blood glucose is >250 mg/dL), they are not given a booster dose of cyclophosphamide on day 14. Drug Treatment: Mice are dosed orally, with vehicle or test compound, once a day from day 0 until day 25. Compounds are suspended in 0.5% methyl cellulose vehicle using a sonicator to ensure uniform suspension. Mice are weighed twice weekly and are dosed according to weight. Dosing volume is 5 mL/kg. The test compound is dosed at, e.g., 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg. Blood glucose is measured twice weekly. After dosing is completed at day 25, the mice continue to be monitored and blood glucose measurements are taken once a week for 3 weeks. Promotion of normoglycemia by the test compound in comparison with vehicle is indicative of the test compound exhibiting therapeutic efficacy in type I diabetes. Example 7 Allograft Survival A compound of the invention can be shown to have therapeutic efficacy in prolonging allograft survival by showing it to have therapeutic efficacy in prolonging, e.g., survival of a skin allograft in an animal model. Animals: Female Balbc/J mice (6 to 7 weeks of age at start of study) (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Me.) are housed four per cage and maintained in a humidity-controlled (40-60%) and temperature-controlled (68-72° F.) facility on a 12 h:12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 6:30 am) with free access to food (Harlan Teklad, Orange, Calif., Rodent Diet 8604) and water. Female C57BL/6 mice (8 to 10 weeks of age at start of study) (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Me.) are similarly housed and maintained. Mice are allowed one week of habituation to the animal facility before testing. Skin Allograft: Balbc/J and C57BL/6 mice are used as donors and recipients, respectively, in a model of skin allograft transplantation. Donor Balbc/J mice are anesthetized, and 0.5 cm—diameter full thickness areas of abdominal skin are surgically removed. Skin grafts harvested from the Balbc/J mice are sutured onto the dorsum of anesthetized recipient C57BL/6 mice. Sutured allografts are covered with Vaseline gauze and Bolster dressing for 7 days. The allografted mice are divided into 8 groups of 8 mice each. Clinical Scoring: Skin allografts are inspected and digital images recorded daily until rejection, which is defined as the first day on which more than 80% of the graft is necrotic. Histological analysis of the rejected graft is carried out on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections. In an optional related study, on post-transplantation day 5 isolated lymphocytes from peripheral lymph nodes and spleen are counted and characterized for activation markers (e.g., T-cell activation markers) by flow cytometry. Also on day 5, grafts are removed from transplanted recipients, cut into small fragments, digested with collagenase and sedimented over Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) to isolate graft-infiltrating lymphocytes, which are counted and characterized for activation markers (e.g., T-cell activation markers) by flow cytometry. Histological analysis of the graft on day 5 can be carried out on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections. Drug Treatment: Mice are dosed orally, with vehicle or test compound, once a day from the day of transplantation until the end of the study, e.g. until day 14, 21 or 28. Dosing volume is 5 mL/kg. The test compound is dosed at, e.g., 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg. Delay of time of rejection of the skin allograft by the test compound in comparison with vehicle is indicative of the test compound exhibiting therapeutic efficacy in prolonging skin allograft survival. Example 8 Effect of Compounds on Colitis A compound of the invention can be shown to have therapeutic efficacy in colitis using an animal model for colitis. Suitable animal models are known in the art (Boismenu et al., J. Leukoc. Biol., 67:267-278, 2000). A first exemplary animal model for colitis is trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis, which presents clinical and histopathological findings that resemble those in Crohn's disease (Neurath et al., J. Exp. Med., 182:1281-1290, 1995; Boismenu et al., J. Leukoc. Biol., 67:267-278, 2000). A second exemplary animal model for colitis is dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, which presents clinical and histopathological findings that resemble those in ulcerative colitis (Okayasu et al., Gastroenterology, 98:694-702, 1990; Boismenu et al., J. Leukoc. Biol., 67:267-278, 2000). Compounds can be commercially tested for efficacy in at least DSS-induced colitis and TNBS-induced colitis, e.g. by the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Me.). A. Mouse Model for Colitis. Animals: Male BALB/c mice (6 weeks of age at start of study) (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Me.) are housed four per cage and maintained in a humidity-controlled (40-60%) and temperature-controlled (68-72° F.) facility on a 12 h:12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 6:30 am) with free access to food (Harlan Telclad, Orange Calif., Rodent Diet 8604) and water. Mice are allowed one week of habituation to the animal facility before testing. TNBS Induction of Colitis: Mice are weighed for baseline body weights and fasted later that day beginning at 6:15 pm just prior to lights-out (day 0). Body weights are taken again the following morning (day 1) at approximately 7:30 am. Mice are anesthetized with isoflurane prior to induction of colitis. Colitis is induced in the mice by intracolonic injection of about 150 mg/kg TNBS in 50% ethanol (in a volume of 150 μL) using an intubation needle (22 g, 1.5 in) inserted completely into the anus with the mouse held by the tail in a vertical position. The mouse is held vertically for 30 additional seconds to allow thorough absorption and minimize leakage, after which the mouse is returned to its cage. Mice are then fed, following the preceding approximately 14 hour of fasting. Each morning thereafter, the mice are weighed. In control experiments, mice receive 50% ethanol alone using the same protocol. Drug Treatment: Drug treatment begins on day 2. Mice are dosed orally, with vehicle or a test compound, once a day from day 2 until the conclusion of the experiment on, e.g., day 7, 14 or 21. Dosing volume is 5 mL/kg. The test compound is dosed at, e.g., 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg. Clinical Scoring: Upon conclusion of the experiment, colons are extracted and measured. Mice are euthanized with CO2 and colon is removed from anus to cecum. Excised colon is measured for entire length, length from anus to end of inflamed area and length of inflamed (affected) area. After measurements, colon is cleared of excrement by flushing with saline and then cut open to clear more thoroughly. Colon is then weighed and preserved in neutral buffered formalin (NBF; 10% formalin, pH 6.7-7.0). The colon tissue is embedded in paraffin and processed for hematoxylin and eosin (H & E)-stained sections. Severity of disease symptoms is scored histologically from the stained sections as follows: 0=no evidence of inflammation; 1=low level of leukocyte infiltration with infiltration seen in <10% of high-power fields AND no structural changes; 2=moderate leukocyte infiltration with infiltration seen in 10% to 25% of high-power fields AND crypt elongation AND bowel wall thickening that does not extend beyond the mucosal layer AND no ulcerations; 3=high level of leukocyte infiltration seen in 25% to 50% of high-power fields AND crypt elongation AND infiltration beyond the mucosal layer AND thickening of the bowel wall AND superficial ulcerations; 4=marked degree of transmural leukocyte infiltration seen in >50% of high-power fields AND elongated and distorted crypts AND bowel wall thickening AND extensive ulcerations. Reduction of the severity of the disease symptoms by the test compound in comparison with vehicle is indicative of the test compound exhibiting therapeutic efficacy in colitis. B. Rat Model for Colitis. Animals: Male Wistar rats (175-200 g at start of study) (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, Mass.) are housed two per cage and maintained in a humidity-controlled (40-60%) and temperature-controlled (68-72° F.) facility on a 12 h:12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 6:30 am) with free access to food (Harlan Teklad, Orange Calif., Rodent Diet 8604) and water. Rats are allowed one week of habituation to the animal facility before testing. TNBS Induction of Colitis: Rats are weighed for baseline body weights and fasted later that day beginning at 6:15 pm just prior to lights-out (day 0). Body weights are taken again the following morning (day 1) at approximately 7:30 am. Rats are anesthetized with isoflurane prior to induction of colitis. Colitis is induced in the rats by intracolonic injection of about 60 mg/kg TNBS in 50% ethanol (in a volume of 500 μL) using a fabricated intubation needle (7.5 Fr umbilical catheter and 14 g hub) inserted 8 cm into the anus with the rat held by the tail in a vertical position. The rat is held vertically for 30 additional s to allow thorough absorption and minimize leakage, after which the rat is returned to its cage. Rats are then fed, following the preceding approximately 14 h of fasting. Each morning thereafter, the rats are weighed. In control experiments, rats receive 50% ethanol alone using the same protocol. Drug Treatment: Drug treatment begins on day 2. Rats are dosed orally, with vehicle or test compound, once a day from day 2 until the conclusion of the experiment on, e.g., day 7, 14 or 21. Dosing volume is 5 mL/kg. Test compound is dosed at, e.g., 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg. Clinical Scoring: Upon conclusion of the experiment, colons are extracted and measured. Rats are euthanized with CO2 and colon is removed from anus to cecum. Excised colon is measured for entire length, length from anus to end of inflamed area, and length of inflamed (affected) area. After measurements, colon is cleared of excrement by flushing with saline and then cut open to clear more thoroughly. Colon is then weighed and preserved in neutral buffered formalin (NBF; 10% formalin, pH 6.7-7.0). The colon tissue is embedded in paraffin and processed for hematoxylin and eosin (H & E)-stained sections. Severity of disease symptoms is scored histologically from the stained sections as follows: 0=no evidence of inflammation; 1=low level of leukocyte infiltration with infiltration seen in <10% of high-power fields AND no structural changes; 2=moderate leukocyte infiltration with infiltration seen in 10% to 25% of high-power fields AND crypt elongation AND bowel wall thickening that does not extend beyond the mucosal layer AND no ulcerations; 3=high level of leukocyte infiltration seen in 25% to 50% of high-power fields AND crypt elongation AND infiltration beyond the mucosal layer AND thickening of the bowel wall AND superficial ulcerations; 4=marked degree of transmural leukocyte infiltration seen in >50% of high-power fields AND elongated and distorted crypts AND bowel wall thickening AND extensive ulcerations. Reduction of the severity of the disease symptoms by the test compound in comparison with vehicle is indicative of the test compound exhibiting therapeutic efficacy in colitis. Example 9 Effects of Compounds on Cardiac Telemetry in the Rat Animals: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g at time of surgery) are implanted by Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, Mass.) with cardiac transmitting devices (Data Sciences PhysioTel C50-PXT) into the peritoneal space, with a pressure-sensing catheter inserted into the descending aorta. Rats are allowed at least one week to recover. Rats are housed in individual cages and maintained in a humidity-controlled (30-70%) and temperature-controlled (20-22° C.) facility on a 12 h:12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 7:00 am) with free access to food (Harlan-Teklad, Orange, Calif., Rodent Diet 8604) and water. Rats are allowed one week of habituation to the animal facility before testing. Measurement of Cardiovascular Parameters: The implanted transmitting devices transmit continuous measurements of blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, mean arterial, pulse), heart rate, body temperature, and motor activity in freely moving conscious animals. These data are transmitted via radiofrequency to a computer which bin the data into 1 min averages using DataSciences ART software. Telemetry recording takes place over a 21-h period, starting at noon and continuing until 9:00 am the following day. A maximum of eight rats are tested at a time, and the same eight rats are utilized for all treatment groups in a within-subject design. Drug Treatment: Rats are injected orally with vehicle or compound at 1:00 pm. A full study (vehicle+3 doses) requires four separate testing sessions, which occur on Mondays-Tuesdays and Thursdays-Fridays. During each of the testing sessions, the eight rats are divided into four treatment groups such that each group comprises N=2 for any given session. Rats are re-tested in subsequent testing sessions in a crossover design such that by the end of the four sessions, all animals receive all treatments in a pseudo-random order, and each group comprises N=8. Exemplary Bradycardia Assay: It is expressly contemplated that the rats can be used to show that a compound of the invention has no or substantially no activity for bradycardia. By way of illustration and not limitation, the rats are administered vehicle or a test compound and heart rate is then measured over a 120 min period. No or substantially no reduction of heart rate in response to the test compound in comparison with vehicle is indicative of the test compound exhibiting no or substantially no activity for bradycardia. Example 10 Effect of Compounds on Arthritis Female Lewis rats were used in this study. Acclimated animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and given the first collagen injection (day 0). On day 6, they were anesthetized again for the second collagen injection. Collagen was prepared by making a 4 mg/mL solution in 0.01 N acetic acid. Equal volumes of collagen and incomplete Freund's adjuvant were emulsified by hand mixing until a bead of this material held its form when placed in water. Each animal received 300 μL of the mixture each time, spread over 3 subcutaneous sites on the back. Treatment (p.o., q.d., 5 mL/kg dosing volume) began on day 0 and continued through day 16 with vehicle or compounds given at 24 h intervals. Rats were weighed on days 0, 3, 6 and 9 through 17 and caliper measurements of the ankles taken on days 9 through 17. The second enantiomer isolated after resolution of compound 12 by HPLC (retention time: 18 min per the conditions reported in Example 1.3), was dosed at 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg. It is apparent from inspection of FIG. 14 that the second enantiomer isolated after resolution of compound 12 by HPLC exhibited activity for reducing mean ankle diameter in the rat. A reduction in mean ankle diameter in the treated animal compared to vehicle only treated animals is an indication that compound 12 exhibits therapeutic efficacy in the collagen-induced arthritis assay. Those skilled in the art will recognize that various modifications, additions, substitutions and variations to the illustrative examples set forth herein can be made without departing from the spirit of the invention and are, therefore, considered within the scope of the invention.
