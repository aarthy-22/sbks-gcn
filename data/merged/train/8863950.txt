Hypoxemia associated with cimetidine therapy in a newborn infant.
Cimetidine therapy used for the treatment of gastric bleeding due to tolazoline therapy in a newborn infant was temporally associated with episodes of severe hypoxemia.
It appears likely that the histamine H2 receptor blocked by cimetidine obviated the pulmonary vasodilator effect of tolazoline therapy.
