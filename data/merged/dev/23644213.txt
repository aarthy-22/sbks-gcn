Low molecular weight dual inhibitors of factor Xa and fibrinogen binding to GPIIb/IIIa with highly overlapped pharmacophores.
Dual antithrombotic agents acting as anticoagulants and aggregation inhibitors could have substantial advantages over currently prescribed combinations of antithrombotic drugs.
Herein, we report compounds with moderate inhibitory activity for factor Xa and fibrinogen GPIIb/IIIa binding (both in the micromolar range).
These compounds resulted from our efforts to merge the pharmacophores of selective factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban with a mimic of the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence of fibrinogen to obtain designed multiple ligands with potential antithrombotic activity.
Resulting from this study, a structurally novel class of submicromolar fibrinogen GPIIb/IIIa binding inhibitor bearing 1,2,4-oxadiazol-5(4H)-one moiety is also described.
