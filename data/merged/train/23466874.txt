Anti-diabetic effects of brown algae derived phlorotannins, marine polyphenols through diverse mechanisms.
Marine algae are popular and abundant food ingredients mainly in Asian countries, and also well known for their health beneficial effects due to the presence of biologically active components.
The marine algae have been studied for biologically active components and phlorotannins, marine polyphenols are among them.
Among marine algae, brown algae have extensively studied for their potential anti-diabetic activities.
Majority of the investigations on phlorotannins derived from brown algae have exhibited their various anti-diabetic mechanisms such as α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibitory effect, glucose uptake effect in skeletal muscle, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP 1B) enzyme inhibition, improvement of insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetic db/db mice, and protective effect against diabetes complication.
In this review, we have made an attempt to discuss the various anti-diabetic mechanisms associated with phlorotannins from brown algae that are confined to in vitro and in vivo.
