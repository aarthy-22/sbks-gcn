BACKGROUND Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) is an important commercial crop in the United States as well as in other countries. In tobacco plants, N-demethylation of nicotine results in nornicotine, a secondary alkaloid known to be a precursor for formation of N-Nitrosonornicotine (“NNN”) in cured leaves. NNN is an undesired component of cured leaves. The predominant alkaloid found in commercial tobacco varieties is nicotine, typically accounting for 90-95% of the total alkaloid pool. The remaining alkaloid fraction is comprised primarily of three additional pyridine alkaloids: nornicotine, anabasine, and anatabine. Nornicotine is generated directly from nicotine through the activity of the enzyme nicotine N-demethylase. Nornicotine usually represents less than 5% of the total pyridine alkaloid pool, but through a process termed “conversion,” tobacco plants that initially produce very low amounts of nornicotine give rise to progeny that metabolically “convert” a large percentage of leaf nicotine to nornicotine. In tobacco plants that have genetically converted (termed “converters”), the great majority of nornicotine production occurs during the senescence and curing of the mature leaf (Wernsman and Matzinger (1968), Tob. Sci., 12:226-228). Burley tobaccos are particularly prone to genetic conversion, with rates as high as 20% per generation observed in some cultivars. During the curing and processing of the tobacco leaf, a portion of the nornicotine is metabolized to the compound NNN, a tobacco-specific nitrosamine (TSNA) that has been asserted to be carcinogenic in laboratory animals (Hecht and Hoffmann (1990), Cancer Surveys, 8:273-294; Hoffmann et al. (1994), J. Toxicol. Environ. Health, 41:1-52; Hecht (1998), Chem. Res. Toxicol., 11:559-603). In flue-cured tobaccos, TSNAs are found to be predominantly formed through the reaction of alkaloids with the minute amounts of nitrogen oxides present in combustion gases formed by the direct-fired heating systems found in traditional curing barns (Peele and Gentry (1999), “Formation of Tobacco-specific Nitrosamines in Flue-cured Tobacco,” CORESTA Meeting, Agro-Phyto Groups, Suzhou, China). Retrofitting these curing barns with heat-exchangers virtually eliminated the mixing of combustion gases with the curing air and dramatically reduced the formation of TSNAs in tobaccos cured in this manner (Boyette and Hamm (2001), Rec. Adv. Tob. Sci., 27:17-22.). In contrast, in the air-cured Burley tobaccos, TSNA formation proceeds primarily through reaction of tobacco alkaloids with nitrite, a process catalyzed by leaf-borne microbes (Bush et al. (2001), Rec. Adv. Tob. Sci., 27:23-46). Thus far, attempts to reduce TSNAs through modification of curing conditions while maintaining acceptable quality standards have not proven to be successful for the air-cured tobaccos.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE This description is not intended to be a detailed catalog of all the different ways in which the disclosure may be implemented, or all the features that may be added to the instant disclosure. For example, features illustrated with respect to one embodiment may be incorporated into other embodiments, and features illustrated with respect to a particular embodiment may be deleted from that embodiment. Thus, the disclosure contemplates that in some embodiments of the disclosure, any feature or combination of features set forth herein can be excluded or omitted. In addition, numerous variations and additions to the various embodiments suggested herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the instant disclosure, which do not depart from the instant disclosure. Hence, the following descriptions are intended to illustrate some particular embodiments of the disclosure, and not to exhaustively specify all permutations, combinations and variations thereof. Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs. The terminology used in the description of the disclosure herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the disclosure. All publications, patent applications, patents and other references cited herein are incorporated by reference in their entireties for the teachings relevant to the sentence and/or paragraph in which the reference is presented. References to techniques employed herein are intended to refer to the techniques as commonly understood in the art, including variations on those techniques or substitutions of equivalent techniques that would be apparent to one of skill in the art. Unless the context indicates otherwise, it is specifically intended that the various features of the disclosure described herein can be used in any combination. Moreover, the present disclosure also contemplates that in some embodiments of the disclosure, any feature or combination of features set forth herein can be excluded or omitted. To illustrate, if the specification states that a composition comprises components A, B and C, it is specifically intended that any of A, B or C, or a combination thereof, can be omitted and disclaimed singularly or in any combination. As used in the description of the disclosure and the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” “an” and “the” are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. As used herein, “and/or” refers to and encompasses any and all possible combinations of one or more of the associated listed items, as well as the lack of combinations when interpreted in the alternative (“or”). The term “about,” as used herein when referring to a measurable value such as a dosage or time period and the like, is meant to encompass variations of ±20%, ±10%, ±5%, +1%, ±0.5%, or even ±0.1% of the specified amount. As used herein, phrases such as “between X and Y” and “between about X and Y” should be interpreted to include X and Y. As used herein, phrases such as “between about X and Y” mean “between about X and about Y” and phrases such as “from about X to Y” mean “from about X to about Y.” The terms “comprise,” “comprises” and “comprising” as used herein, specify the presence of the stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof. As used herein, the transitional phrase “consisting essentially of” means that the scope of a claim is to be interpreted to encompass the specified materials or steps recited in the claim and those that do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristic(s) of the claimed disclosure. Thus, the term “consisting essentially of” when used in a claim of this disclosure is not intended to be interpreted to be equivalent to “comprising.” “Introducing,” in the context of a polynucleotide sequence (e.g., a recombinant polynucleotide and/or expression cassette of the disclosure), means presenting a polynucleotide sequence to the plant, plant part, and/or plant cell in such a manner that the polynucleotide sequence gains access to the interior of a cell. Where more than one polynucleotide sequence is to be introduced these polynucleotide sequences can be assembled as part of a single polynucleotide or nucleic acid construct, or as separate polynucleotide or nucleic acid constructs, and can be located on the same or different transformation vectors. Accordingly, these polynucleotides can be introduced into plant cells in a single transformation event, in separate transformation events, or, e.g., as part of a breeding protocol. Thus, the term “transformation” as used herein refers to the introduction of a heterologous nucleic acid into a cell. Transformation of a cell may be stable or transient. Thus, in some embodiments, a plant cell, plant part or plant of this disclosure can be stably transformed with a recombinant polynucleotide of the disclosure. In other embodiments, a plant cell, plant part or plant of this disclosure can be transiently transformed with a recombinant polynucleotide of the disclosure. “Tobacco product” is defined as “any product made or derived from tobacco that is intended for human use or consumption, including any component, part, or accessory of a tobacco product (except for raw materials other than tobacco used in manufacturing a component, part, or accessory of a tobacco product)” (section 201 of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 321). The label and packaging is part of a tobacco product. Terms “nicotine conversion rate,” “percent nicotine conversion,” and “percentage nicotine conversion” are used interchangeably. Percent nicotine demethylation in a sample is calculated by dividing the level of nornicotine by the combined level of nicotine and nornicotine as measured in the sample, and multiplying by 100. NC174 SRC In one aspect, the present disclosure provides tobacco cultivars, and parts thereof, from NC174 SRC, representative sample seeds of this cultivar having been deposited with the ATCC under ATCC Accession No. PTA-121048. In another aspect, the present disclosure provides a tobacco plant, or part thereof, produced by growing a seed of NC174 SRC. In a further aspect, a plant of the present disclosure can include a plant with all, or essentially all, of the morphological and physiological characteristics of cultivar NC174 SRC. While not being limited by process, NC174 SRC is a result of the introduction of three mutated CYP82E genes in a burley tobacco cultivar NC174. The three genes are a mutated CYP82E4 gene recited as 325-6 #775 in Lewis et al. (“Three nicotine demethylase genes mediate nornicotine biosynthesis in Nicotiana tabacum L.: Functional characterization of the CYP82E10 gene,” Phytochemistry, 71 (2010), 1988-1998 (SEQ ID NO: 1, which sets forth a cyp82e4 W329Stop, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety)), a mutated CYP82E5v2 recited in Lewis et al. (supra) as 325-6 #1-13 (SEQ ID NO: 2, which sets forth a cyp82e5v2 W422Stop, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety), and a mutated CYP82E10 recited in Lewis et al. (supra) as 325-6 #1041 (SEQ ID NO:11, which sets forth a cyp82e10 P381S, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). Mutations cyp82e4 W329Stop and cyp82e5v2 W422Stop result in truncated proteins while cyp82E10 P381S results in a nonfunctional protein. A cyp82e4 W329Stop (“e4”), a cyp82e5v2 W422Stop (“e5”), and a cyp82e10 P381S (“e10”) mutation are introduced from a e4e4|e5e5|e10e10 triple mutant from a strong converter burley background, line DH98-325-6, as listed in Table 4 of Lewis et al. (supra) into a burley tobacco cultivar NC174 background. NC174 SRC is the result of seven backcrosses with burley cultivar NC174 as the recurrent parent, followed by two rounds of selfing with selection for homozygosity for the cyp82e4 W329Stop, the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop, and cyp82e10 P381S mutations to yield BC7F3 plants (NC174 SRC) in which the wild-type CYP82E4, CYP82E5v2 and CYP82E10 alleles of NC174 are replaced by the mutant (e.g., cyp82e4 W329Stop, cyp82e5v2 W422Stop, and cyp82e10 P381S) alleles. NC174 SRC progeny plants have genetic backgrounds that are at least 95%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% similar to NC174. NC174 SRC plants exhibit low nornicotine levels and produce leaves with reduced potential for accumulating derived NNN during curing, storage, and smoking. CMS NC174 SRC In other aspects, the present disclosure also provides tobacco cultivars, and parts thereof, from CMS NC174 SRC, representative sample seeds of this cultivar having been deposited with the ATCC under ATCC Accession No. PTA-121069. In further aspects, the present disclosure provides a tobacco plant, or part thereof, produced by growing a seed of CMS NC174 SRC. In still further aspects, the plant of the present disclosure can include a plant with all, or essentially all, of the morphological and physiological characteristics of cultivar CMS NC174 SRC. CMS NC174 SRC is a male-sterile (CMS) version of NC174 (CMS NC174 SRC) produced by crossing a plant of CMS NC174 as a female with pollen of NC174 SRC BC6F1 to produce male-sterile plants heterozygous for all three mutations. The CMS progeny plants of the CMS NC174×NC174 SRC BC6F1 cross are male sterile. A plurality of CMS NC174×NC174 SRC BC6F1×CMS plants (e.g., CMS F1 progeny plants) are screened for the cyp82e4 W329Stop, cyp82e5v2 W422Stop, and cyp82e10 P381S mutations to identify plants heterozygous for all three mutations. A single male-sterile plant resulting from this cross is backcrossed as a female to NC174 SRC to prepare BC7F1 CMS progeny. BC7F1 CMS progeny homozygous for the cyp82e4 W329Stop, the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop, and cyp82e10 P381S mutations are identified by genotyping and designated as CMS NC174 SRC. Because the CMS NC174 SRC line is male sterile, it is maintained via pollination with NC174 SRC. NC174 SRC is crossed as the male parent to CMS NC174 SRC to prepare CMS NC174 SRC F1 progeny plants. CMS NC174 SRC and CMS NC174 SRC F1 progeny plants have genetic backgrounds that are at least 95%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% similar to NC174. CMS NC174 SRC and CMS NC174 SRC F1 progeny plants exhibit low nornicotine levels and produce leaves with reduced potential for accumulating derived NNN during curing, storage, and smoking. NC821-11 SRC In some aspects, the present disclosure provides tobacco cultivars, and parts thereof, from NC821-11 SRC, where representative sample seeds of this cultivar have been deposited with the ATCC under ATCC Accession No. PTA-121050. In other aspects, the present disclosure provides a tobacco plant, or part thereof, produced by growing a seed of NC821-11 SRC. In still further aspects, a plant of the present disclosure can include a plant with all, or essentially all, of the morphological and physiological characteristics of cultivar NC821-11 SRC. While not being limited by process, NC821-11 SRC is a result of introducing the cyp82e4 W329Stop, cyp82e5v2 W422Stop, and cyp82e10 P381S mutations from DH98-325-6. F1 individuals originating from a cross between NC821-11 and DH98-325-6 and heterozygous for each mutation are then backcrossed seven times to NC821-11 to produce BC7F1 progeny. BC7F1 individuals heterozygous for all three mutations are self-pollinated to produce BC7F2 seed and individuals homozygous for all three mutations identified. A single BC7F2 plant is self-pollinated to produce BC7F3 (NC821-11 SRC) in which the wild-type CYP82E4, CYP82E5v2 and CYP82E10 alleles of NC821-11 are replaced by the mutant (e.g., cyp82e4 W329Stop, cyp82e5v2 W422Stop, and cyp82e10 P381S). NC821-11 SRC has a genetic background that is at least 95%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% similar to NC821-11. NC821-11 SRC exhibits low nornicotine levels and produce leaves with reduced potential for accumulating derived NNN during curing, storage, and smoking. NC 5 SRC In other aspects, the present disclosure provides tobacco cultivars, and parts thereof, from NC 5 SRC. In another aspect, the present disclosure provides a tobacco plant, or part thereof, produced by growing the seed of NC 5 SRC. In a further aspect, a plant of the present disclosure can include a plant with all, or essentially all, of the morphological and physiological characteristics of cultivar NC 5 SRC. While not being limited by process, NC 5 SRC is produced by pollinating plants of CMS NC174 SRC with pollen of NC821-11 SRC. Again, not limited by any particular scientific theory, cyp82e4 W329Stop, cyp82e5v2 W422Stop, and cyp82e10 P381S mutations all encode for proteins with reduced or eliminated ability to convert nicotine to nornicotine. NC 5 SRC has a genetic background that is at least 95%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% similar to burley tobacco cultivar NC 5 LC, a hybrid generated by pollinating plants of a male-sterile breeding line CMS NC174 with pollen produced by fertile breeding line NC821-11. NC 5 SRC exhibits low nornicotine and is not subject to conversion to high nornicotine. NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC In one aspect, the present disclosure provides tobacco cultivars, and parts thereof, from NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC, representative sample seeds of this cultivar having been deposited with the ATCC under ATCC Accession No. PTA-121046.

In a further aspect, a plant of the present disclosure can include a plant with all, or essentially all, of the morphological and physiological characteristics of cultivar NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC. While not being limited by process, NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC is a result of the introduction of three mutated CYP82E genes in a burley tobacco cultivar NC775 Bmr/Bmr. The three genes are a mutated CYP82E4 gene recited as 325-6 #775 in Lewis et al. (“Three nicotine demethylase genes mediate nornicotine biosynthesis in Nicotiana tabacum L.: Functional characterization of the CYP82E10 gene,” Phytochemistry, 71 (2010), 1988-1998 (SEQ ID NO: 1, which sets forth a cyp82e4 W329Stop, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety)), a mutated CYP82E5v2 recited in Lewis et al. (supra) as 325-6 #1-13 (SEQ ID NO: 2, which sets forth a cyp82e5v2 W422Stop, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety), and a mutated CYP82E10 recited in Lewis et al. (supra) as 325-6 #1041 (SEQ ID NO: 11, which sets forth a cyp82e10 P381S, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). Mutations cyp82e4 W329Stop and cyp82e5v2 W422Stop result in truncated proteins while cyp82E10 P381S results in a nonfunctional protein. A cyp82e4 W329Stop (“e4”), a cyp82e5v2 W422Stop (“e5”), and a cyp82e10 P381S (“e10”) mutation are introduced from a e4e4|e5e5|e10e10 triple mutant from a strong converter burley background, line DH98-325-6, as listed in Table 4 of Lewis et al. (supra) into a burley tobacco cultivar NC775 Bmr/Bmr background.

NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC progeny plants have genetic backgrounds that are at least 95%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% similar to NC775 Bmr/Bmr. NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC plants exhibit low nornicotine levels and produce leaves with reduced potential for accumulating derived NNN during curing, storage, and smoking.

CMS NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC is a male-sterile (CMS) version of NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC (CMS NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC) produced by crossing a plant of CMS NC775 as a female with pollen of NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC BC6F1 to produce male-sterile plants heterozygous for all three mutations and the Bmr blue mold resistance locus. The CMS progeny plants of the CMS NC775 Bmr/Bmr×NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC BC6F1 cross are male sterile. A plurality of CMS NC775 Bmr/Bmr×NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC BC6F1×CMS plants (e.g., CMS F1 progeny plants) are screened for the cyp82e4 W329Stop, cyp82e5v2 W422Stop, and cyp82e10 P381S mutations to identify plants heterozygous for all three mutations and for DNA markers linked to Bmr. A single male-sterile plant resulting from this cross is backcrossed as a female to NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC to prepare BC7F1 CMS progeny. BC7F1 CMS progeny homozygous for the cyp82e4 W329Stop, the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop, and cyp82e10 P381S mutations and the Bmr blue mold resistance locus are identified by genotyping and designated as CMS NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC.

The percentage of secondary alkaloids relative to total alkaloid content contained in a plant of the present disclosure may not be statistically different than from a commercial seedlot of NC174, NC821-11, NC775 Bmr/Bmr, NC645 Bmr/Bmr, or hybrid cultivar NC 5 LC or NC 8 LC. A tobacco plant of the present disclosure designated NC174 SRC, CMS NC174 SRC, NC821-11 SRC, NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC, CMS NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC, NC645 Bmr/Bmr SRC, or hybrid cultivar NC 5 SRC or NC 8 SRC, carrying the cyp82e4 W329Stop, the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop, and cyp82e10 P381S alleles can be used in a plant breeding program to create useful lines, cultivars, varieties, progeny, inbreds, and hybrids. Thus, in some aspects, an F1, F2, F3, or later generation tobacco plant containing the cyp82e4 W329Stop, the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop, and cyp82e10 P381S alleles is crossed with a second Nicotiana plant, and progeny of the cross are identified in which the cyp82e4 W329Stop, the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop, and cyp82e10 P381S alleles are present. It will be appreciated that the second Nicotiana plant can be NC174, CMS NC174, NC821-11, NC775 Bmr/Bmr, CMS NC775 Bmr/Bmr, NC645 Bmr/Bmr or any other Nicotiana species or line, optionally with an additional desirable trait, such as herbicide resistance. In still other aspects, methods of the present disclosure further include self-pollinating or pollinating a male sterile pollen acceptor with a pollen donor capable of being used in production of a progeny plant of the present disclosure, such as a male sterile hybrid of the present disclosure. Either the male sterile pollen acceptor plant or the pollen donor plant has at least one mutant allele, two, or even three mutant alleles at a nicotine demethylase locus, such as the cyp82e4 W329Stop, cyp82e5v2 W422Stop, and cyp82e10 P381S alleles. In an aspect, all three alleles at each nicotine demethylase locus are mutant alleles, making the plant homozygous for cyp82e4 W329Stop, the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop, and cyp82e10 P381S. Breeding can be carried out via any known procedures. DNA fingerprinting, SNP or similar technologies may be used in a marker-assisted selection (MAS) breeding program to transfer or breed mutant alleles of a nicotine demethylase gene into other tobaccos. For example, a breeder can create segregating populations from hybridizations of a genotype containing cyp82e4 W329Stop, cyp82e5v2 W422Stop, and cyp82e10 P381S alleles with an agronomically desirable genotype. Plants in the F2 or backcross generations can be screened using a marker developed from cyp82e4 W329Stop, the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop, or cyp82e10 P381S alleles or a fragment thereof, using one of the techniques known in the art or disclosed herein. Plants identified as possessing one or more cyp82e4 W329Stop, the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop, and cyp82e10 P381S alleles can be backcrossed or self-pollinated to create a second population to be screened. Depending on the expected inheritance pattern or the MAS technology used, it may be necessary to self-pollinate the selected plants before each cycle of backcrossing to aid identification of the desired individual plants. Backcrossing or other breeding procedure can be repeated until the desired phenotype of the recurrent parent is recovered. A recurrent parent in the present disclosure can be NC174 SRC, CMS NC174 SRC, NC821-11 SRC, NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC, CMS NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC, NC645 Bmr/Bmr SRC, NC 5 SRC or NC 8 SRC. Other breeding techniques can be found, for example, in Wernsman, E. A., and Rufty, R. C., 1987. Chapter Seventeen. Tobacco. pages 669-698 In: Cultivar Development. Crop Species. W. H.

The result of a plant breeding program using the mutant tobacco plants described herein includes useful lines, cultivars, varieties, progeny, inbreds, and hybrids. As used herein, the term “cultivar” or “variety” refers to a population of plants that share constant characteristics which separate them from other plants of the same species. A cultivar or variety is often, although not always, sold commercially. While possessing one or more distinctive traits, a cultivar or variety is further characterized by a very small overall variation between individuals within that cultivar or variety. A “pure line” variety may be created by several generations of self-pollination and selection, or vegetative propagation from a single parent using tissue or cell culture techniques. A cultivar or variety can be essentially derived from another cultivar, line, or variety. As defined by the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (Dec. 2, 1961, as revised at Geneva on Nov. 10, 1972, on Oct. 23, 1978, and on Mar. 19, 1991), a cultivar or variety is “essentially derived” from an initial cultivar or variety if: a) it is predominantly derived from the initial cultivar or variety, or from a cultivar or variety that is predominantly derived from the initial cultivar or variety, while retaining the expression of the essential characteristics that result from the genotype or combination of genotypes of the initial cultivar or variety; b) it is clearly distinguishable from the initial cultivar or variety; and c) except for the differences which result from the act of derivation, it conforms to the initial cultivar or variety in the expression of the essential characteristics that result from the genotype or combination of genotypes of the initial cultivar or variety. Essentially derived varieties can be obtained, for example, by the selection of a natural or induced mutant, a somaclonal variant, a variant individual from plants of the initial cultivar or variety, backcrossing, or transformation. A “line” as distinguished from a cultivar or variety most often denotes a group of plants used non-commercially, for example in plant research. A line typically displays little overall variation between individuals for one or more traits of interest, although there may be some variation between individuals for other traits. Hybrid tobacco varieties can be produced by preventing self-pollination of female parent plants (i.e., seed parents) of a first variety, permitting pollen from male parent plants of a second variety to fertilize the female parent plants, and allowing F1 hybrid seeds to form on the female plants. Self-pollination of female plants can be prevented by emasculating the flowers at an early stage of flower development. Alternatively, pollen formation can be prevented on the female parent plants using a form of male sterility. For example, male sterility can be produced by cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS), or transgenic male sterility wherein a transgene inhibits microsporogenesis and/or pollen formation, or self-incompatibility. Female parent plants containing CMS are particularly useful. In aspects in which the female parent plants are CMS, pollen may be harvested from male fertile plants and applied manually to the stigmas of CMS female parent plants, and the resulting F1 seed is harvested. Plants can be used to form single-cross tobacco F1 hybrids. In such an aspect, the plants of the parent varieties can be grown as substantially homogeneous adjoining populations to facilitate natural cross-pollination from the male parent plants to the female parent plants. The F1 seed formed on the female parent plants is selectively harvested by conventional means. One also can grow the two parent plant varieties in bulk and harvest a blend of F1 hybrid seed formed on the female parent and seed formed upon the male parent as the result of self-pollination. Alternatively, three-way crosses can be carried out wherein a single-cross F1 hybrid is used as a female parent and is crossed with a different male parent. As another alternative, double-cross hybrids can be created wherein the F1 progeny of two different single-crosses are themselves crossed. Self-incompatibility can be used to particular advantage to prevent self-pollination of female parents when forming a double-cross hybrid. Successful crosses yield F1 plants that are fertile, have cyp82e4 W329Stop, cyp82e5v2 W422Stop, and cyp82e10 P381S alleles, and can be backcrossed with one of the parents, such as NC174 SRC, CMS NC174 SRC, NC821-11 SRC, NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC, CMS NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC, NC645 Bmr/Bmr SRC, NC 5 SRC, or NC 8 SRC, if desired. In some aspects, a plant population in the F2 generation is screened for cyp82e4 W329Stop, the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop, and cyp82e10 P381S alleles. Selected plants can be crossed with one of the parents and the first backcross (BC1) generation plants are self-pollinated to produce a BC1 F2 population that is again screened for variant nicotine demethylase gene expression (e.g., the null version of the nicotine demethylase gene). The process of backcrossing, self-pollination, and screening is repeated, for example, at least four times, until the final screening produces a plant that is fertile and reasonably similar to the recurrent parent. This plant, if desired, is self-pollinated and the progeny are subsequently screened again to confirm that the plant exhibits the same low nicotine conversion phenotype as NC174 SRC, CMS NC174 SRC, NC821-11 SRC, NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC, CMS NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC, NC645 Bmr/Bmr SRC, NC 5 SRC, NC 8 SRC. Breeder's seed of the selected plant is produced using standard methods including, for example, field testing, confirmation of the null condition for nicotine demethylase, chemical analyses of cured leaf to determine the level of alkaloids and/or chemical analyses of cured leaf to determine the ratio of nornicotine to nicotine+nornicotine. In one aspect, a F1 progeny is the result of a cross between NC174 SRC and CMS NC174 SRC to generate F1 progeny that are male sterile. In another aspect, a F1 progeny is the result of a cross between NC821-11 SRC and CMS NC174 SRC to generate F1 progeny that are male sterile. In one aspect, an F1 progeny is the result of a cross between NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC and CMS NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC to generate F1 progeny that are male sterile. In another aspect, an F1 progeny is the result of a cross between NC645 Bmr/Bmr SRC and CMS NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC to generate F1 progeny that are male sterile. Male sterile tobacco plants may be produced by any method known in the art. Methods of producing male sterile tobacco are described in Wernsman, E. A., and Rufty, R. C. 1987. Chapter Seventeen.

A plant comprising a mutation in a nicotine demethylase gene can be identified by selecting or screening the mutagenized plant material, or progeny thereof. Such screening and selection methodologies are known to those having ordinary skill in the art. Examples of screening and selection methodologies include, but are not limited to, Southern analysis, PCR amplification for detection of a polynucleotide, Northern blots, RNase protection, primer-extension, RT-PCR amplification for detecting RNA transcripts, enzymatic assays for detecting enzyme or ribozyme activity of polypeptides and polynucleotides, and protein gel electrophoresis, Western blots, immunoprecipitation, and enzyme-linked immunoassays to detect polypeptides. Other techniques such as in situ hybridization, enzyme staining, and immunostaining also can be used to detect the presence or expression of polypeptides and/or polynucleotides. Methods for performing all of the referenced techniques are known. It is understood that a tobacco plant of the present disclosure, including NC174 SRC, CMS NC174 SRC, NC821-11 SRC, NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC, CMS NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC, NC645 Bmr/Bmr SRC, and hybrid cultivars NC 5 SRC and NC 8 SRC, can be transformed by a genetic construct (nucleic acid construct) or transgene using any technique known in the art. Without limitation, an example of a desired trait can include herbicide resistance, pest resistance, disease resistance, high yield, high grade index, curability, curing quality, mechanical harvestability, holding ability, leaf quality, height, plant maturation (e.g., early maturing, early to medium maturing, medium maturing, medium to late maturing, or late maturing), stalk size (e.g., small, medium, or large stalk), or leaf number per plant (e.g., small (e.g., 5-10 leaves), medium (e.g., 11-15 leaves), or large (e.g., 16-21) number of leaves), or any combination. Any plant of the present disclosure can be used as a basis for tissue culture, regeneration, transformed, or a combination of any of these.

Having now generally described the disclosure, the same will be more readily understood through reference to the following examples that are provided by way of illustration, and are not intended to be limiting of the present disclosure, unless specified. EXAMPLES Example 1 Breeding of Homozygous cyp82e4 W329Stop, the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop, and cyp82e10 P381S Mutant Plants into the NC174Burley Tobacco Cultivar NC174 SRC is a backcross-derived version of burley tobacco cultivar NC174 carrying introduced mutations in three genes (CYP82E4 (SEQ ID NO: 5), CYP82E5 (SEQ ID NO: 8), and CYP82E10 (SEQ ID NO: 9)) previously documented to encode for nicotine demethylase enzymes (Lewis et al., 2010). The introduced mutations in CYP82E4 (cyp82e4 W329Stop (SEQ ID NO: 1)) and CYP82E5 (cyp82e5v2 W422Stop (SEQ ID NO: 2)) encode for premature stop codons which render the genes non-functional. The introduced mutation in CYP82E10 (cyp82e10 P381S (SEQ ID NO: 11)) does not encode for a premature stop codon, but does render the gene product non-functional for converting nicotine to nornicotine (Lewis et al. 2010). When in homozygous condition, the three mutations result in tobacco plants with (1) reduced genetic capacity to demethylate nicotine to form nornicotine, and (2) a corresponding diminished potential to accumulate N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN), a potent carcinogen found in many tobacco products. The mutation in CYP82E4 (cyp82e4 W329Stop (SEQ ID NO: 1)) also provides phenotypic stability for the “nicotine conversion” trait and eliminates the requirement to utilize the cumbersome “LC” method for reducing levels of nornicotine in tobacco cultivars. The original tobacco cultivar NC174 is a fertile inbred line. CMS NC174 is a cytoplasmic male-sterile version of NC174. To develop NC174 SRC, an individual plant of NC174 is pollinated with a plant of the genetic background DH98-325-6 carrying mutations in each of the three nicotine demethylase genes. F1 individuals originating from this cross and heterozygous for each mutation are backcrossed to the recurrent parent, NC174, to produce BC1F1 progeny. BC1F1 progeny are screened using genotyping methodologies to identify individuals heterozygous for all three mutations. A single triple heterozygous BC1F1 plant is backcrossed to NC174 to produce BC2F1 progeny. The process of backcrossing and identification of individuals heterozygous for all three mutations is repeated through the BC3F1, BC4F1, BC5F1, BC6F1, and BC7F1 stages. At the BC7F1 stage, individuals heterozygous for all three mutations from each pedigree are self-pollinated to produce BC7F2 seed. A large number of BC7F2 progeny from each pedigree are genotyped to identify individuals homozygous for all three mutations. A single BC7F2 plant homozygous for all three mutations is self-pollinated to produce a BC7F3 family (NC174 SRC) in which the wild-type CYP82E4, CYP82E5v2, and CYP82E10 alleles of NC174 were replaced by the mutant alleles (cyp82e4 W329Stop, cyp82e5v2 W422Stop, and cyp82e10 P381S). The male-sterile (CMS) version of NC174 SRC (CMS NC174 SRC) is produced by crossing a plant of CMS NC174 as a female with pollen of NC174 SRC to produce male-sterile plants heterozygous for all three mutations. A single male-sterile plant resulting from this cross is then subsequently backcrossed as a female to NC174 SRC to produce progeny that are segregating for individuals homozygous for all three mutations. Triple homozygous individuals are identified by DNA genotyping to produce the CMS NC174 SRC line. Because the line is male-sterile, it is maintained via pollination with NC174 SRC. Commercial NC174 SRC is produced by pollinating plants of CMS NC174 SRC with pollen of NC174 SRC. Example 2 Testing of NC174 SRC NC174 SRC is evaluated for cured leaf chemistry, yield, and physical quality at two North Carolina field research locations during 2013 (Reidsville and Waynesville). NC174 is included for comparison. The experimental design at each location is a randomized complete block design with four replications. Experimental units are single 20-plant plots. Plots are harvested and air-cured. Plot weights are used to determine per acre yields. Cured leaf is evaluated by a former USDA tobacco grader. Fifty gram composite leaf samples are collected from each plot and analyzed for percent nicotine, nornicotine, anatabine, anabasine, and percent nicotine conversion using gas chromatography equipment. Comparisons using the least significant difference (LSD) test indicates that NC174 SRC has lower levels of nornicotine and percent nicotine conversion relative to NC174 (Table 1). NC174 and NC174 SRC are not significantly different from each other for percent nicotine but are significantly different for yield and cured leaf quality indices. Example 3 Breeding of homozygous cyp82e4 W329Stop, the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop, and cyp82e10 P381S Mutant Plants into the NC821-11 Burley Tobacco Cultivar NC821-11 SRC is a backcross-derived version of burley tobacco cultivar NC821-11 carrying introduced null mutations in three genes (CYP82E4 (SEQ ID NO: 5), CYP82E5 (SEQ ID NO: 8), and CYP82E10 (SEQ ID NO: 9)) previously documented to encode for nicotine demethylase enzymes (Lewis et al., Phytochemistry, 71 (2010), 1988-1998). The introduced mutations in CYP82E4 (cyp82e4 W329Stop (SEQ ID NO: 1)) and CYP82E5 (cyp82e5v2 W422Stop (SEQ ID NO: 2)) encode for premature stop codons which render the genes non-functional. The introduced mutation in CYP82E10 (cyp82e10 P381S (SEQ ID NO: 11)) does not encode for a premature stop codon, but does render the gene product non-functional for converting nicotine to nornicotine (Id.). When in homozygous condition, the three mutations result in tobacco plants with (1) reduced genetic capacity to demethylate nicotine to form nornicotine, and (2) a corresponding diminished potential to accumulate N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN), a potent carcinogen found in many tobacco products. The mutation in CYP82E4 (cyp82e4 W329Stop (SEQ ID NO: 1)) also provides phenotypic stability for the “nicotine conversion” trait and eliminates the requirement to utilize the cumbersome “LC” method for reducing levels of nornicotine in tobacco cultivars (see e.g., Jack et al. 2007. Implications of reducing nornicotine accumulation in burley tobacco: appendix A—the LC protocol. Rec. Adv. Tob. Sci. 33: 58-79). The original tobacco cultivar NC821-11 is a fertile inbred line. To develop NC821-11 SRC, an individual plant of NC821-11 is initially pollinated with a plant of the genetic background DH98-325-6 carrying mutations in each of the three nicotine demethylase genes. F1 individuals originating from this cross and heterozygous for each mutation are backcrossed to the recurrent parent, NC821-11, to produce BC1F1 progeny. BC1F1 progeny are screened using genotyping methodologies to identify individuals heterozygous for all three mutations. A single triple heterozygous BC1F1 plant is backcrossed to NC821-11 to produce BC2F1 progeny. The process of backcrossing and identification of individuals heterozygous for all three mutations is repeated through the BC3F1, BC4F1, BC5F1, BC6F1, and BC7F1 stages. At the BC7F1 stage, individuals heterozygous for all three mutations from each pedigree are self-pollinated to produce BC7F2 seed. A large number of BC7F2 progeny from each pedigree are genotyped to identify individuals homozygous for all three mutations. A single BC7F2 plant homozygous for all three mutations is self-pollinated to produce a BC7F3 family (NC821-11 SRC) in which the wild-type CYP82E4, CYP82E5v2, and CYP82E10 alleles of NC821-11 were replaced by the mutant alleles (cyp82e4 W329Stop, cyp82e5v2 W422Stop, and cyp82e10 P381S). Example 4 Testing of NC821-11 SRC NC821-11 SRC is evaluated for cured leaf chemistry, yield, and physical quality at two North Carolina field research locations during 2013 (Reidsville and Waynesville). NC821-11 is included for comparison. The experimental design at each location is a randomized complete block design with four replications. Experimental units are single 20-plant plots. Plots are harvested and air-cured. Plot weights are used to determine per acre yields. Cured leaf is evaluated by a former USDA tobacco grader. Fifty gram composite leaf samples are collected from each plot and analyzed for percent nicotine, nornicotine, anatabine, anabasine, and percent nicotine conversion using gas chromatography equipment. Comparisons using the least significant difference (LSD) test indicated that NC821-11 SRC has lower levels of nornicotine and percent nicotine conversion relative to NC821-11 (Table 1). NC821-11 and NC821-11 SRC are not significantly different from each other for percent nicotine, yield, or cured leaf quality indices. Example 5 Breeding of Homozygous cyp82e4 W329Stop, the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop, and cyp82e10 P381S Mutant Plants into the NC 5 LC Burley Tobacco Cultivar The original tobacco cultivar NC 5 LC is a hybrid generated by pollinating plants of a male-sterile breeding line CMS NC174 with pollen produced by fertile breeding line NC821-11. Hybrid cultivar NC 5 SRC is a hybrid generated by pollinating plants of a male-sterile breeding line CMS NC174 SRC with pollen produced by fertile breeding line NC821-11 SRC with each breeding line carrying introduced deleterious mutations in three genes (CYP82E4 (SEQ ID NO: 5), CYP82E5 (SEQ ID NO: 8), and CYP82E10 (SEQ ID NO: 9)) previously documented to encode for nicotine demethylase enzymes (Lewis et al., Phytochemistry, 71 (2010), 1988-1998). The introduced mutations in CYP82E4 (cyp82e4 W329Stop (SEQ ID NO: 1)) and CYP82E5 (cyp82e5v2 W422Stop (SEQ ID NO: 2)) encode for premature stop codons which render the genes non-functional. The introduced mutation in CYP82E10 (cyp82e10 P381S (SEQ ID NO: 11)) does not encode for a premature stop codon, but does render the gene product non-functional for converting nicotine to nornicotine (Id.). When in homozygous condition, the three mutations result in tobacco plants with (1) reduced genetic capacity to demethylate nicotine to form nornicotine, and (2) a corresponding diminished potential to accumulate N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN), a potent carcinogen found in many tobacco products. The mutation in CYP82E4 (cyp82e4 W329Stop (SEQ ID NO: 1)) also provides phenotypic stability for the “nicotine conversion” trait and eliminates the requirement to utilize the cumbersome “LC” method for reducing levels of nornicotine in tobacco cultivars (see e.g., Jack et al. 2007. Implications of reducing nornicotine accumulation in burley tobacco: appendix A—the LC protocol. Rec. Adv. Tob. Sci. 33: 58-79). The original tobacco cultivar NC 5 LC is a hybrid generated by pollinating plants of a male-sterile breeding line CMS NC174 with pollen produced by fertile breeding line NC821-11. To develop hybrid cultivar NC 5 SRC, individual plants of fertile NC174 are first pollinated with a plant of the genetic background DH98-325-6 carrying mutations in each of the three nicotine demethylase genes. F1 individuals originating from each cross and heterozygous for each mutation are backcrossed to the recurrent parent (NC174) to produce BC1F1 progenies. BC1F1 progenies are screened using genotyping methodologies to identify individuals heterozygous for all three mutations. A single BC1F1 plant from each pedigree is backcrossed to NC174, to produce BC2F1 progenies. The process of backcrossing and identification of individuals heterozygous for all three mutations is repeated through the BC3F1, BC4F1, BC5F1, BC6F1, and BC7F1 stages. At the BC7F1 stage, individuals heterozygous for all three mutations from each pedigree are self-pollinated to produce BC7F2 seed. A large number of BC7F2 progeny from each pedigree are genotyped to identify individuals homozygous for all three mutations. BC7F2 plants homozygous for all three mutations are self-pollinated to produce BC7F3 families (NC174 SRC) in which the wild-type CYP82E4, CYP82E5v2, and CYP82E10 alleles of NC174 are replaced by the mutant alleles (cyp82e4 W329Stop, cyp82e5v2 W422Stop, and cyp82e10 P381S). The female parental line of NC174, CMS NC174, is cytoplasmic male sterile which causes pollen to not be produced. To develop CMS NC174 SRC, a plant of CMS NC174 is crossed with NC174 SRC to produce male-sterile plants heterozygous for all three mutations. A single male-sterile plant resulting from this cross is backcrossed as a female to NC174 SRC to produce progeny that are segregating for individuals homozygous for all three mutations. Triple homozygous individuals are identified by DNA genotyping to produce the CMS NC174 SRC line. Because the line is male-sterile, it is maintained via pollination with NC174 SRC (see above). Hybrid cultivar NC 5 SRC is produced by pollinating plants of CMS NC174 SRC with pollen of NC821-11 SRC. Example 6 Testing of Hybrid Cultivar NC 5 SRC Hybrid cultivar NC 5 SRC is evaluated for cured leaf chemistry, yield, and physical quality at two North Carolina field research locations during 2013 (Reidsville and Waynesville). The experimental design at each location is a randomized complete block design with four replications. Experimental units are single 20-plant plots. Plots are harvested and air-cured. Plot weights are used to determine per acre yields. Cured leaf is evaluated by a former USDA tobacco grader. Fifty gram composite leaf samples are collected from each plot and analyzed for percent nicotine, nornicotine, anatabine, anabasine, and percent nicotine conversion using gas chromatography equipment. Comparisons using the least significant difference (LSD) test indicates that hybrid cultivar NC 5 SRC has significantly (P<0.05) lower levels of nornicotine and percent nicotine conversion relative to NC 5LC (Table 1). NC 5LC and hybrid cultivar NC 5 SRC are not significantly different from each other for percent nicotine, yield, or cured leaf quality indices. Example 7 Breeding of NC775 Bmr/Bmr and NC645 Bmr/Bmr A major blue mold resistance gene designated as Bmr (Milla, S. M., J. S. Levin, R. S. Lewis, and R. C. Rufty (2005) RAPD and SCAR markers associated with an introgressed gene conditioning resistance to Peronospora tabacina D.B. Adam. in tobacco. Crop Science 45:2346-2354) is first introduced into NC775 and NC645 using a backcross breeding procedure. Individual plants of fertile NC775 and NC645 are first pollinated with NC2000 which is homozygous for Bmr. F1 individuals heterozygous for Bmr are backcrossed to the recurrent parents (NC775 or NC645) to produce BC1F1 progenies. BC1F1 progenies are screened for Bmr using associated DNA markers (Milla et al., 2005) to identify individual heterozygous for Bmr. A single BC1F1 plant from each pedigree is backcrossed to either NC775 or NC645, respectively, to produce BC2F1 progenies. The process of backcrossing to either NC775 or NC645 is repeated through the BC3F1, BC4F1, BC5F1, BC6F1 and BC7F1 stages. At the BC7F1 stage, individuals heterozygous for Bmr from each pedigree are self-pollinated to produce BC7F2 seed. A large number of BC7F2 progeny from each pedigree are genotyped to identify individuals homozygous for Bmr. Selected BC7F2 plants homozygous for Bmr are self-pollinated to produce BC7F3 families designated as NC775 Bmr/Bmr and NC645 Bmr/Bmr. Example 8 Breeding of Homozygous cyp82e4 W329Stop, the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop, and cyp82e10 P381S Mutant Plants into the NC775 Bmr/Bmr Burley Tobacco Cultivar NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC is a backcross-derived version of burley tobacco cultivar NC775 Bmr/Bmr carrying introduced mutations in three genes (CYP82E4 (SEQ ID NO: 5), CYP82E5 (SEQ ID NO: 8), and CYP82E10 (SEQ ID NO: 9)) previously documented to encode for nicotine demethylase enzymes (Lewis et al., 2010). The introduced mutations in CYP82E4 (cyp82e4 W329Stop (SEQ ID NQ: 1)) and CYP82E5 (cyp82e5v2 W422Stop (SEQ ID NO: 2)) encode for premature stop codons which render the genes non-functional. The introduced mutation in CYP82E10 (cyp82e10 P381S (SEQ ID NO: 11)) does not encode for a premature stop codon, but does render the gene product non-functional for converting nicotine to nornicotine (Lewis et al. 2010).

The mutation in CYP82E4 (cyp82e4 W329Stop (SEQ ID NO: 1)) also provides phenotypic stability for the “nicotine conversion” trait and eliminates the requirement to utilize the cumbersome “LC” method for reducing levels of nornicotine in tobacco cultivars. The original tobacco cultivar NC775 Bmr/Bmr is a fertile inbred line. CMS NC775 Bmr/Bmr is a cytoplasmic male-sterile version of NC775 Bmr/lmr. To develop NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC, an individual plant of NC775 Bmr/Bmr is pollinated with a plant of the genetic background DH98-325-6 carrying mutations in each of the three nicotine demethylase genes.

BC1F1 progeny are screened using genotyping methodologies to identify individuals heterozygous for all three mutations. A single triple heterozygous BC1F1 plant is backcrossed to NC775 Bmr/Bmr to produce BC2F1 progeny. The process of backcrossing and identification of individuals heterozygous for all three mutations is repeated through the BC3F1, BC4F1, BC5F1, BC6F1, and BC7F1 stages.

The male-sterile (CMS) version of NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC (CMS NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC) is produced by crossing a plant of CMS NC775 Bmr/Bmr as a female with pollen of NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC to produce male-sterile plants heterozygous for all three mutations. A single male-sterile plant resulting from this cross is then subsequently backcrossed as a female to NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC to produce progeny that are segregating for individuals homozygous for all three mutations. Triple homozygous individuals are identified by DNA genotyping to produce the CMS NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC line. Because the line is male-sterile, it is maintained via pollination with NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC. Commercial NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC is produced by pollinating plants of CMS NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC with pollen of NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC. Example 9 Testing of NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC is evaluated for cured leaf chemistry, yield, and physical quality at two North Carolina field research locations during 2013 (Reidsville and Waynesville).

NC775 and NC775 Bmr/Bmr SRC are not significantly different from each other for percent nicotine, yield, or cured leaf quality indices.
