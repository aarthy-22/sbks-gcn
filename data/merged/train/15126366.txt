Characterization of the interaction of ingenol 3-angelate with protein kinase C. Ingenol 3-angelate (I3A) is one of the active ingredients in Euphorbia peplus, which has been used in traditional medicine.
Here, we report the initial characterization of I3A as a protein kinase C (PKC) ligand.
I3A bound to PKC-alpha in the presence of phosphatidylserine with high affinity; however, under these assay conditions, little PKC isoform selectivity was observed.
PKC isoforms did show different sensitivity and selectivity for down-regulation by I3A and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in WEHI-231, HOP-92, and Colo-205 cells.
In all of the three cell types, I3A inhibited cell proliferation with somewhat lower potency than did PMA.
In intact CHO-K1 cells, I3A was able to translocate different green fluorescent protein-tagged PKC isoforms, visualized by confocal microscopy, with equal or higher potency than PMA.
PKC-delta in particular showed a different pattern of translocation in response to I3A and PMA.
I3A induced a higher level of secretion of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 compared with PMA in the WEHI-231 cells and displayed a marked biphasic dose-response curve for the induction.
I3A was unable to cause the same extent of association of the C1b domain of PKC-delta with lipids, compared with PMA or the physiological regulator diacylglycerol, and was able to partially block the association induced by these agents, measured by surface plasmon resonance.
The in vitro kinase activity of PKC-alpha induced by I3A was lower than that induced by PMA.
The novel pattern of behavior of I3A makes it of great interest for further evaluation.
