MMF-Derivatives of Ethyleneglycols The present invention relates to novel compounds, e.g. for use as a medicament. In particular, the present invention relates to novel prodrugs of monomethyl fumarate (MMF) suitable as a medicament, preferably in the treatment and/or prevention of systemic diseases, autoimmune diseases, and/or inflammatory diseases, for example multiple sclerosis and psoriasis. Further, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the novel compounds. Background of the invention Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is an oral therapeutic agent which is reported to reduce the rejection often occurring in connection with an organ transplantation (host versus graft reaction). Further, DMF is approved to be suitable as medicament for the treatment or prevention of a variety of diseases. For example, DMF is proposed in the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Further, DMF is suggested to be a suitable active pharmaceutical agent in the treatment of psoriasis. DMF is characterized by the following chemical Formula (1): Formula (1) When taken orally DMF is reported to be hydrolyzed for example by esterases in the intestine to monomethyl fumarate (MMF). MMF can be regarded as a metabolite of DMF and can be characterized by the following chemical Formula (2): Formula (2) The mechanisms of action of DMF or its metabolite MMF is reported to include inhibition of cytokine-induced nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-KB), apoptosis of stimulated T cells, and increased production of the T 2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 in stimulated T cells, whereas generation of the T l cytokine interferon gamma (IFN-γ) is supposed to remain unaffected. DMF is described to activate the transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2- related factor 2), which binds to antioxidant response elements in the promoters of protective genes such as NADPH-quinone-oxidoreductase- 1 (NQOl) and heme- oxygenase-1. Thus, this ultimately raises the levels of the important intracellular antioxidant glutathione (cf. Albrecht P. et al., Journal of Neuroinflammation 2012, 9: 163). Further, it is alleged that the treatment of animals or primary cultures of CNS cells with DMF or MMF resulted in increased nuclear levels of active Nrf2, with subsequent up-regulation of canonical antioxidant target genes. DMF or MMF treatment increased cellular redox potential, glutathione, ATP levels, and mitochondrial membrane potential in a concentration-dependent manner. Treating astrocytes or neurons with DMF or MMF also significantly improved cell viability after toxic oxidative challenge in a concentration-dependent manner. This effect on viability was lost in cells that had eliminated or reduced Nrf2. These data suggest that DMF and MMF are cytoprotective for neurons and astrocytes against oxidative stress-induced cellular injury and loss, potentially via up-regulation of an Nrf2-dependent antioxidant response. Thus, in summary, it is indicated that in vivo DMF and MMF show about the same the efficacy, in particular on the transcription factor Nrf2. As mentioned above, when taken orally DMF is rather rapidly hydrolyzed by esterases in the intestine to monomethyl fumarate (MMF). Thus, significant amounts of MMF are released within a short period of time. Such a rapid hydrolysis in principle was expected to provide a high level of MMF in the plasma within a short period of time. However, it has been found that a high MMF plasma level might not be achievable. A reason might be that the organism might not be capable of transferring the complete amount of MMF to the sites of the body where the pharmacological action takes place. Additionally, it is reported that DMF has to be administered in quite high amounts and that the pharmaceutically active agent often shows undesirable side effects such as flush and especially symptoms related to the gastrointestinal tract such as irritation of the stomach and diarrhoea. Consequently, there is still a need for new medicaments, preferably for use in the treatment and/or prevention of systemic diseases, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, for example multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. The medicaments should be capable of being applied in appropriate doses and should not cause significant undesired side effects. Hence, it was an object of the present invention to overcome the drawbacks of the above-mentioned market drug substance DMF. It was an object to develop a compound to be used as a medicament for the above - mentioned diseases wherein said compound shows advantageous pharmacokinetic properties. In particular, compounds should be provided which are hydro lysed differently to MMF, for example more rapidly or more slowly, especially more slowly than DMF in the human body (or under respective in-vitro conditions). Further, the compounds should preferably cause few undesirable side effects. Additionally, it was an object of the present invention to provide compounds which can be used in the treatment of an autoimmune disease, preferably the early phase of an autoimmune disease, in particular of multiple sclerosis, such that the progress of the disease can be delayed. Summary of the invention According to the present invention, the above objectives are achieved by the specific compounds described herein by Formula (I). Said compounds can be used as a medicament for the treatment and/or prevention of systemic diseases, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, for example multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.

In an alternative particularly preferred embodiment of the invention in a compound according Formula (I) n is 3 and R is trans -CO-CH=CH-COOCH3. Thus, in an alternative especially preferred embodiment the compound according to Formula (I) is selected from the compounds according to Formulae (VI) and (VII) Formula (VI) It is preferred that, in particular for non-medical use, a compound according to Formula (I) is not represented by a compound according to Formula (V) A compound according to Formula (I) can preferably be synthesized following route: Formula (Ε') Formula (I) Preferably, in step a compound according to Formula (Ε') and MMF can be submitted to an esterification in an organic solvent in the presence of a coupling agent. A coupling agent is preferably a substance generally facilitating the formation of an ester or an amide.

Such a protection group can for example be a trialkylsilyl group. After the coupling reaction the protection can preferably be removed by a suitable reaction. The above compounds according to Formula (I) show excellent pharmacokinetic properties. Within two hours the compounds show a hydrolysis into MMF and remaining organic residue wherein the hydrolysis is modified to the one of DMF. As a result, a smaller amount of MMF is released within the two hours and thus the compounds can be referred to as compounds (prodrugs of MMF) with an intrinsically retarded release of MMF. Additionally, the remaining organic residue is not expected to harm the patient's organism. Further, the present invention relates to a compound according to Formula (I) wherein R is hydrogen or trans -CO-CF CH-COOCH3 and n is an integer of 0 to 10 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, solvate, polymorph, and/or mixtures thereof for use as a medicament.

Systemic diseases do not just affect single organs. Instead, these diseases are known to affect a number of organs and tissues or even the body as a whole. People having an autoimmune disease usually suffer from their immune system mistakenly attacking their own cells of their organism and thus incorrectly responding to substances normally present in the body. An inflammation can be defined as the response of the body to the occurrence of harmful stimuli which can result in pain, heat, redness, swelling and loss of function of the affected organ. It is possible that some of the above-mentioned diseases cannot be allocated in one single group of the above-mentioned groups, since they show the symptoms of more than one of them.

The gastric juice-resistant film coating (often also referred to as enteric coating) can comprise film-forming agents being for example fats, fatty acids, waxes, alginates, shellac, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, cellulose derivatives such as carboxy methyl ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate succinate, cellulose acetate phthalate, hydro xypropyl methyl cellulose phthalate, hydro xypropyl methyl cellulose acetate succinate, cellulose acetate trimellitate, and meth(acrylic)acid copolymers such as methyl acrylate-methacrylic acid copolymers, methyl methacrylate-methacrylic acid copolymers, Eudragits (for example Eudragit® L30D, Eudragit® L, Eudragit® S). The coating is preferably free of active ingredient. It is further preferred that the thickness of the coating is usually 10 μιη to 2 mm, preferably from 50 to 500 μιη. The preferred coating may comprise a film-forming agent and one or more of the following: lubricant, surfactant, glidant, pigment and water.

This mixture was vortexed for 15 sec and centrifuged (13,000 rpm, 3 min). Thereafter, 4 μΐ of the supernatant were subjected to LC-MS analysis. 7.2.2 Incubation experiments with DMF (reference) and compounds of the invention 7.2.2.1 Stock solutions Stock solutions were prepared in DMSO or, for one compound, in DMSO with 10% (v/v) water. Concentrations in stock solutions were 5.00, 2.50 and 1.67 mmol for compounds with one, two and three molar MMF equivalents. 7.2.2.2 Incubation Experiment In a HPLC glass vial, 8 μΐ of stock solution were mixed with 792 μΐ dil IF and the mixture was stirred (250rpm) in a water bath (T=37°C).

In particular, the release kinetics of the first equivalent of MMF was essentially identical to that of DMF (time 0-30 min) while the second equivalent was released more slowly. Example 8: In vivo Pharmacology Assessment and comparison of the efficacy of compounds of the invention and DMF (reference) in MOG35_55-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in C57BL/6 mice: Test system: male C57BL/6 mice, 12 weeks old; 10 animals per treatment group; Induction of EAE: Day -1 - subcutaneous injection of MOG35-55, suspended in complete Freund's adjuvans and intraperitoneal injection of pertussis toxin. Day 3 - intraperitoneal injection of pertussis toxin. Treatment: Dimethylfumarate and test substances or vehicle only were administered via oral route. Test substances were dissolved or suspended in 0.5% hydroxy ethylcellulose (dissolved in 50 mM potassium dihydrogenphosphate, pH 5.0). Drug concentration in dose formulations: 11.54 mM; Dose volume: 10 ml/kg body weight; Start of treatment: Day 1 Observations (clinical Observations were recorded daily between day 1 and 13. score and body weight): Clinical score: grade 0 - 10; 0 (= no impairments), 1 (normal movement; limp tail: proximal 2/3 of the tail is limp and droopy), 2 (normal movement; whole tail is limp; 3 (wobbly walk; absent righting reflex), 4 (gait ataxia), 5 (mild paraparesis), 6 (moderate paraparesis), 7 (severe paraparesis or paraplegia), 8 (tetraparesis), 9 (moribund), 10 (death). The results are shown in Figure 2 (body weight) and Figure 3 (clinical score). Treatment of animals with vehicle only, first symptoms were observed on day 8 (3 of 10 animals; mean clinical score: 0.4) and the status worsened until day 13 (all animals affected; clinical score: 4.6). In contrast, the prophylactic treatment of animals with DMF or compound of Example 1 protected from the development of clinical symptoms and the body weight remained stable. Example 9: Membrane Permeability The membrane permeability was investigated in Caco-2 monolayers. DMF was investigated in a separate experiment for comparison. Based on the assumption that in vivo, the intact molecules will be pre-systemically metabolized, the permeability test was performed only in the apical baso lateral direction. The test concentration in the apical medium was 250 μΜ. The assay was validated by controlling the membrane integrity with Lucifer yellow (post-experimental integrity) and by determination of the permeability of atenolol (low permeability), testosterone (high permeability) and erythromycin (P-gp substrate). Furthermore, a significant metabolism or degradation of the test compound was expected and therefore, the parent compound as well as MMF was determined in the acceptor compartment (basolateral medium). Sampling time points were 15, 45 and 90 min. The results are summarized in the following: The mean apparent permeability of the test compounds expressed as Papp x 10"6 is 1.8 ± 0.2 cm/sec was for DMF and 1.0 ± 0.1 cm/sec for Example 1. Compared to the reference molecules, DMF and the compound of Example 1 can be categorized as moderate permeability drugs. The recovery of all test and reference compounds was similar (11.6 % for DMF, 17.1 % for compound of Example 1), which indicates a similar susceptibility to hydrolysis. Example 10: In vivo Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of MMF after administration of the compound of Example 1 and DMF for comparison was investigated in female NMRI mice (3 animals per group). The test compound was dissolved in DMSO/PEG300 (20/80) and administered p.o. (gavage) at a dose volume of 10 ml/kg. DMF was given at a dose of 45 mg/kg. The test compound was dosed at a MMF-equivalent dose, i.e. 65.3 mg/kg. Blood samples were taken at 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0 and 8.0 h after drug administration. Mean concentration vs. time profiles of MMF in the linear and semi-logarithmic scale are shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5. Pharmacokinetic parameters, derived by non-compartmental analysis for test compound (Example 1): * : F = bioavai ability of MMF relative to administration of DMF and of DMF for comparison: The rate and extent of systemic exposure of animals to MMF after administration of the different compounds were very similar. Compared to the bioavailability of MMF after administration of DMF, the relative bioavailability of MMF after administration of test compound (Example 1) was 85%. Example 11: Effect of MMF-prodrugs according to Example 1 and Example 2 on Imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like skin inflammation BALB/c mice (n=6 per treatment group), 8 to 10 weeks old, received a daily topical dose of 65 mg of commercially available IMQ cream (5%) (Aldara; 3M Pharmaceuticals) on the shaved back for 8 consecutive days (day 1 to day 8). The test articles (Example 1 and Example 2) were administered via the oral route twice daily between day 5 and day 8 at a dose of 15 mg/kg. For administration of the compound according to Example 1, the solid compound was dissolved in 0.5% hydroxyethylcellulose (in 50 mM KH2PO4, pH 5.0) at a concentration of 2.18 mg/ml. For administration of the compound according to Example 2, 1 vol. of a stock solution (19.5 mg/ml in DMSO) was dissolved with 9 vol. of 0.5% hydroxyethylcellulose (in 50 mM KH2PO4, pH 5.0). The dose volume was 10 ml/kg. The effect of treatment with vehicle only, with intravenously administered anti-TNF antibody (= positive control) or with the test articles was evaluated on day 9. The severity of inflammation of the back skin was determined using the PASI (psoriasis area and severity index) scoring system as follows: 0 = normal mouse skin; 1 = mild reddening; 2 = erythema; 3 = erythema, swelling; 4 = erythema, swelling, scaling; 5 = erythema, swelling, scaling, (bloody) lesions. Furthermore, cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-a and IL-27) and chemokines (IP- 10 and GRO-a) were determined in serum from blood samples, which were withdrawn on day 9. In Figure 6 the effect of treatment with vehicle (p.o., twice daily), anti-TNFa antibody (i.v., two injections in total), as well as test substances (according to Example 1 and Example 2, p.o. twice daily, 15 mg/kg) on the PASI score in Imiquimod-induced psoriasis in Balb/c mice is shown. In Figures 7a through 7e the effect of treatment with vehicle (p.o., twice daily), anti TNFa antibody (i.v., two injections in total), as well as test substances (according to Example 1 and Example 2, p.o. twice daily, 15 mg/kg) on the serum cytokine and chemokine concentrations (Figure 7a (IFN-γ), 7b (TNF-a), 7c (IL-27), 7d (IP- 10) and 7e (GRO-a) in Imiquimod-induced psoriasis in Balb/c mice. Blood samples were withdrawn 1 h and 4 h after the final treatment is presented. Reference Example: comparision of the kinetics of MMF-Release of (E)-But-2- enedioic acid l-((E)-3-methoxycarbonyl-acryloyloxy)-ethyl ester methyl ester according to example 45 of WO2010022177 (US20100048651) and DMF during incubation in intestinal fluid of the minipig (E)-But-2-enedioic acid 1-chloro-ethyl ester methyl ester: Anhydrous zinc chloride (0.1 g; 0.8 mmol) was added to pure (E)-3-Chlorocarbonyl- acrylic acid methyl ester (5.6 g; 38 mmol) and the resulting mixture stirred for 2h at room temperature. Acetaldehyde (2.5 mL; 45 mmol) was added dropwise while maintaining the temperature below 20°C. After complete addition stirring was continued for lh and after quenched with water (15 mL) and aqueous NaHC03 (10%; 6 mL). The mixture was extracted with EtOAc (2 x 100 mL), the combined organic layers washed with brine (50 mL), dried over Na2S04 and concentrated under reduced pressure. The remaining crude product was purified via silica gel chromatography (eluent: 10: 1 v/v; n-heptane: MtBE) to yield 1.7 g (8.8 mmol; 23%) of pure (E)-But-2- enedioic acid 1-chloro-ethyl ester methyl ester. (E)-But-2-enedioic acid l-((E)-3-methoxycarbonyl-acryloyloxy)-ethyl ester methyl ester: A solution of mono-Methyl fumarate (1.72 g; 13.2 mmol) in N-Methylpyrrolidone (10 mL) was added to pure (E)-But-2-enedioic acid 1-chloro-ethyl ester methyl ester (1.7 g; 8.8 mmol) followed by NaHC03 (0.96 g; 11.5 mmol). The resulting suspension was heated to 55°C and stirred for 4h. Due to a moderate conversion, the reaction temperature was increased to 80°C and stirring was continued for 12h. The mixture was allowed to reach room temperature, diluted with ethyl acetate (150 mL) and washed with water (2 x 50 mL) and brine (50 mL). The organic layer was dried over Na2S04, concentrated under reduced pressure and the remaining crude product purified via silica gel chromatography (eluent: 4: 1 v/v; n-heptane: MtBE) to yield 0.79 g (2.8 mmol; 31%) of a colorless solid. As can be seen from Figure 8 (E)-But-2-enedioic acid l-((E)-3-methoxycarbonyl- acryloyloxy)-ethyl ester methyl ester, which bears one equivalents of MMF, show a different hydrolyzation than that of DMF. In particular, the release kinetics is considerable faster than that of DMF. 1.
