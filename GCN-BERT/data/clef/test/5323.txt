The invention further relates to said alkoxylate. The invention further relates to a method of preparing said composition by bringing the alkoxylate and the pesticide into contact. Finally, the invention relates to a method of controlling phytopathogenic fungi and/or undesired plant growth and/or undesired insect or mite attack and/or for regulating the growth of plants, wherein said composition is allowed to act on the respective pests, their environment or the crop plants to be protected from the respective pest, on the soil and/or on undesired plants and/or on the crop plants and/or on their environment; and to seed containing said composition. The preferred embodiments of the invention mentioned herein below have to be understood as being preferred either independently from each other or in combi- nation with one another. Adjuvants are important agroformulation auxiliaries and assist in improving the stability of the formulation and the efficacy of the pesticide. It is an ongoing challenge to identify new adjuvants with improved properties. Object of the present invention was to overcome the problems of the state of the art. The object was solved by a composition comprising a pesticide and an alkoxylate of the formula (I) R1-[A01]n-0-C(0)-0-[A02]m-R2 (I) where R1 and R2 are independently a C6-C32 hydrocarbon group, AO1 and AO2 are independently a C2-C6 alkyleneoxy group, and n and m are independently a value from 2 to 100. In another form the object was solved by the alkoxylate of the formula (I). The term agrochemical composition refers usually to a composition which is suitable for a industrial application in controlling phytopathogenic fungi and/or undesired plant growth and/or undesired insect or mite attack and/or for regulating the growth of plants, wherein the composition is allowed to act on the respective pests, their environment or the crop plants to be protected from the respective pest, on the soil and/or on undesired plants and/or on the crop plants and/or on their environment. Industrial application of agrochemical compositions are usually subject to various specific legal restrictions and specific registration processes. An expert is well aware that other composition, such as deodorizing or pharmaceutical preparations, as well as cosmetics, are usually not suitable for an industrial application in controlling phytopathogenic fungi and/or undesired plant growth and/or undesired insect or mite attack and/or for regulating the growth of plants, wherein the composition is allowed to act on the respective pests, their environment or the crop plants to be protected from the respective pest, on the soil and/or on undesired plants and/or on the crop plants and/or on their environment. R1 and R2 are independently usually a monovalent C6-C32 aliphatic hydrocarbon group, prefera- bly a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated C8-C20 alkyl. More preferably, R1 and R2 are independently a linear or branched, saturated C10-C18 alkyl. Mixtures of different hydrocarbon groups are also possible, such as mixtures of different chain lenghts, and/or of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons. In one form R1 and R2 are identical. In another form R1 and R2 are different. Typical examples for R1 or R2 are linear or branched decyl, undecyl, dodecyl, tridecyl, hexa- decyl, heptadecyl and octadecyl, or mixture of the aforementioned residues. In another form examples for R1 or R2 are selected from branched C13 alkyl. In another form examples for R1 or R2 are selected from linear C12-C18 alkyl. In another form examples for R1 or R2 are selected from branched C10 alkyl, such as 2-propylheptyl. In another form R1 and R2 are independently a branched C10 alkyl. In an especially preferred form, R1 and R2 are 2-propylheptyl. AO1 and AO2 are independently usually a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched C2-C6 alkyleneoxy group. Mixtures of different C2-C6 alkyleneoxy group are also possible (e.g. AO1 and AO2 are each independently a mixture of ethyleneoxy and a C3-C6 alkyleneoxy group, wherein a mixture of ethyleneoxy and propyleneoxy is preferred). Examples for AO1 or AO2 are independently ethyleneoxy, propyleneoxy, butyleneoxy, or mixtures thereof. AO1 or AO2 are more preferably independently ethylenoxy, or a mixture of ethyleneoxy and propyleneoxy. In particular, AO1 and AO2 are ethyleneoxy. The indices n and m are independently usually any value from 2 to 100, preferably from 2,2 to 50, more preferably from 2,5 to 20, and in particular from 3 to 13. The ratio of n to m is usually from 10 / 1 to 1 / 10, preferably from 3 / 1 to 1 / 3, more preferably from 2 / 1 to 1 / 2, and in particular from 1 ,5 / 1 to 1 / 1 ,5. In another form the alkoxylate is of the formula (I) where R1 and R2 are independently a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated C8-C20 alkyl, AO1 and AO2 are independently ethyleneoxy, or ethyleneoxy and propyleneoxy, and n and m are independently from 2 to 50. In another form the alkoxylate is of the formula (I) where R1 and R2 are independently a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated C8-C20 alkyl, AO1 and AO2 are ethyleneoxy, and n and m are independently from 2,5 to 20. In another form the alkoxylate is of the formula (I) where R1 and R2 are 2-propylheptyl, AO1 and AO2 are independently ethyleneoxy, or ethyleneoxy and propyleneoxy, and n and m are independently from 2 to 30. In another form the alkoxylate is of the formula (I) where R1 and R2 are independently linear C12- C18 alkyl, AO1 and AO2 are independently ethyleneoxy, or ethyleneoxy and propyleneoxy, and n and m are independently from 2 to 30. In another form the alkoxylate is of the formula (I) where R1 and R2 are independently branched Ci3 alkyl, AO1 and AO2 are independently ethyleneoxy, or ethyleneoxy and propyleneoxy, and n and m are independently from 2 to 30. In a form the alkoxylate is of formula (I), where AO1 and AO2 are ethyleneoxy. This form corre- sponds to the alkoxylate of formula (II) R1-[0-CH2-CH2]n-0-C(0)-0-[CH2-CH2-0]m-R2 (II), where R1, R2, n and m have the meanings and preferred forms as defined above. The alkoxylates of the formula (I) and (II) may be prepared by the reaction of a dialkyi carbonate (e.g. diethyl carbonate or dimethyl carbonate, wherein the latter is preferred) with an alkyl alkoxylate. Suitable alkyl alkoxylates are those of the formula (III) R1-[A01]n-0-H (III) where R1, AO1 and n have the meaning as described above. The reaction may be catalyzed by alkaline catalysts, such as sodium methylate. Usually, the reaction temperature is between 15 and 250 °C. Various means, such as vacuum, may be used to remove byproducts (e.g. ethanol from diethyl carbonate). The reaction product may be further purified to obtain the alkoxylate of the formula (I) or (II). In a preferred form the reaction product containing the alkoxylate of the formula (I) or (II) may be used as technical quality without further purification. The technical quality of the reaction product may comprise up to 40 wt%, preferably up to 25 wt% and more preferably up to 15 wt% of starting materials or byproducts. The composition may contain at least 0,1 wt%, preferably at least 1 wt% of the alkoxylate of formula (I). The composition according to the invention may be present as an agrochemical composition type and comprises from 1 to 80% by weight of the alkoxylate of formula (I), preferably from 2 to 50% by weight and in particular from 5 to 30% by weight.

In a further embodiment, either individual components of the composition according to the in- vention or partially premixed components, e. g. components comprising the pesticide and the adjuvant, may be mixed by the user in a spray tank and further auxiliaries and additives may be added, if appropriate. In a further embodiment, either individual components of the composition according to the invention or partially premixed components, e. g. components comprising the pesticide and/or the adjuvant can be applied jointly (e.g. after tank mix) or consecutively. The present invention furthermore relates to a method of preparing the composition according to the invention by bringing the adjuvant of the formula (I) and the pesticide into contact, e.g. by mixing. The contacting may be done between 5 to 95 °C. Thus, a tankmix or a agrochemical composition may be prepared.

Examples of suitable crop plants are cereals, for example wheat, rye, barley, triticale, oats or rice; beet, for example sugar or fodder beet; pome fruit, stone fruit and soft fruit, for example apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries, strawberries, raspberries, currants or gooseberries; legumes, for example beans, lentils, peas, lucerne or soybeans; oil crops, for example oilseed rape, mustard, olives, sunflowers, coconut, cacao, castor beans, oil palm, peanuts or soybeans; cucurbits, for example pumpkins/squash, cucumbers or melons; fiber crops, for example cotton, flax, hemp or jute; citrus fruit, for example oranges, lemons, grapefruit or tange- rines; vegetable plants, for example spinach, lettuce, asparagus, cabbages, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes, pumpkin/squash or capsicums; plants of the laurel family, for example avocados, cinnamon or camphor; energy crops and industrial feedstock crops, for example maize, soybeans, wheat, oilseed rape, sugar cane or oil palm; maize; tobacco; nuts; coffee; tea; bananas; wine (dessert grapes and grapes for vinification); hops; grass, for example turf; sweetleaf (Stevia rebaudania); rubber plants and forest plants, for example flowers, shrubs, deciduous trees and coniferous trees, and propagation material, for example seeds, and harvested produce of these plants. The term crop plants also includes those plants which have been modified by breeding, muta- genesis or recombinant methods, including the biotechnological agricultural products which are on the market or in the process of being developed. Genetically modified plants are plants whose genetic material has been modified in a manner which does not occur under natural conditions by hybridizing, mutations or natural recombination (i.e. recombination of the genetic material). Here, one or more genes will, as a rule, be integrated into the genetic material of the plant in order to improve the plant's properties. Such recombinant modifications also comprise posttranslational modifications of proteins, oligo- or polypeptides, for example by means of gly- cosylation or binding polymers such as, for example, prenylated, acetylated or farnesylated residues or PEG residues. The present invention also relates to seed (such as seeds or other plant propagation materials) comprising the composition according to the invention. Plant propagation materials can be treated preventively with the composition according to the invention at the point of or even before sowing or at the point of or even before transplanting. For the treatment of seed, one will generally use water-soluble concentrates (LS), suspensions (FS), dusts (DS), water-dispersible and water-soluble powders (WS, SS), emulsions (ES), emulsifiable concentrates (EC) and gels (GF). These compositions can be applied to the propagation materials, in particular seed, in undiluted form or, preferably, in diluted form. Here, the composition in question can be diluted 2- to 10-fold, so that from 0.01 to 60% by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 40% by weight, of active substance is present in the compositions used for the seed dressing. The application may be effected before or during sowing. The treatment of plant propagation material, in particular the treatment of seed, is known to the skilled worker and carried out by dusting, coating, pelleting, dipping or soaking the plant propagation material, the treatment preferably being carried out by pelleting, coating and dusting or by in-furrow treatment so that, for example, untimely early germination of the seed is prevented. It is preferred to use suspensions for the treatment of seed. Usually, such compositions comprise from 1 to 800 g/l of active substance, from 1 to 200 g/l of surfactants, from 0 to 200 g/l of antifreeze agents, from 0 to 400 g/l of binders, from 0 to 200 g/l of colorants and solvent, preferably water. The present invention further relates to a use of the alkoxylate of the formula (I) according to the invention for improving the efficacy of the pesticide. Usually, the efficacy is improved compared to the same use of the pesticide without the alkoxylate of the formula (I). The advantages of the invention are high stability of the formulation and of the spray mixture, little wind-caused drift in the case of spray applications, good adhesion of the formulation on the surface of the treated plants, increased solubility of the pesticides in the formulation, increased uptake of the pesticides into the plant, or more rapid or enhanced activity of the pesticide (e.g. even at a low dose rate). Other advantages are the high biodegradability of the alkoxylate; the low toxicity of the alkoxylate, the ability of the alkoxylate to lower the surface tension of aqueous compositions, or the increased spreading on plant surfaces; or the low harmful effect against crop plants, i.e. low phytotoxic effects. The examples which follow illustrate the invention without imposing any limitation. Examples Alcohol Alkoxylate A: ethoxylated (9 EO units) C12-C18 fatty alcohol. Alcohol Alkoxylate B: ethoxylated (3 EO units) saturated alcohol, Brookfield viscosity about 50 mPas (23 °C, 60 rpm). Alcohol Alkoxylate C ethoxylated (5 EO units) saturated alcohol, Brookfield viscosity about 85 mPas (23 °C, 60 rpm). Alcohol Alkoxylate D ethoxylated (7 EO units) saturated alcohol, Brookfield viscosity about 100 mPas (23 °C, 60 rpm). Alcohol Alkoxylate E: ethoxylated (10 EO units) saturated alcohol, Brookfield viscosity about 30 mPas (60 °C, 60 rpm). Alcohol Alkoxylate F: ethoxylated (12 EO units) saturated alcohol, Brookfield viscosity about 40 mPas (60 °C, 60 rpm). Alcohol Alkoxylate G ethoxylated (3 EO units) C12-C18 fatty alcohol, pour point <13 °C. Alcohol Alkoxylate H ethoxylated (5 EO units) C12-C18 fatty alcohol, solidification temperature about 12 °C. Alcohol Alkoxylate I: ethoxylated (7 EO units) C12-C18 fatty alcohol, solidification temperature about 15 °C. Alcohol Alkoxylate J: ethoxylated (3 EO units) 2-propylheptanol, HLB about 9. Alcohol Alkoxylate K: ethoxylated (4 EO units) 2-propylheptanol, HLB about 10,5. Alcohol Alkoxylate L: ethoxylated (6 EO units) 2-propylheptanol, HLB about 12,5. Examples 1 -15 - Preparation of alkoxylate 199,5 g Alcohol Alkoxylate A (0,33 mol) and diethyl carbonate or dimethyl carbonate (0,23 mol) were mixed with 0,59 g sodium methylate (30% in methanol) and heated to 80 °C while stirring. The temperature was increased to 140°C and the resulting ethanol was distilled off. When no more ethanol was distilled off, a vacuum of 1 mbar was applied to remove further volatile com- ponents. Finally, the composition was cooled to room temperature and filtered. 175 g of the product were obtained as yellowish product. The Alcohol Alkoxylates B to L were reacted with diethyl carbonate accordingly to prepare the alkoxylate of the formula (I) according to the invention (Table 1 , column "Educt" depicts Alcohol Alkoxylates A to L. Table 1 : Product characteristics (SZ means total acid number; VZ means saponification number; OHZ means hydroxyl number). Example 16 - Increased biological activity The biological activity was assessed in a greenhouse on wheat (species "Kanzler"), which was infected with Puccinia triticina at two leafes stage and incubated for three days at high humidity. The plants were sprayed (spray volume 200 l/ha) with a composition comprising 50 ppm (10 g/ha) epoxiconazole and 100 ppm (20 g/ha) of the respective adjuvant samples from Example 1 -15. In the comparative example no adjuvant was added. The plants were further cultivated for ten days at 20-24 °C and 60-90 % relative humidity. Finally, the percentage of the infected leaf area (pustules) was visually inspected. Each value was based on three replicates. The results are summarized in Table 2. For comparison, the starting material Alcohol Alkoxylate G was tested, which was used to prepare the product of Example 4. Table 2: a) comparative example, b) without adjvuant Example 17 - Increased biological activity The biological activity was assessed in a greenhouse as described in Example 16 with a re- duced dose rate of 2,5 g/ha pesticide. The results are summarized in Table 3. For comparison, the starting material Alcohol Alkoxylate G was tested, which was used to prepare the product of Example 4. Table 3: a) comparative example without adjvuant Example 18 - Surface Tension Physical measurements were done with a solution or dispersion of 1 g/l of the samples from Examples 1 -15 in deionized water. The static or equilibrium surface tension is a characteristic value of the interfacial activity of a formulation in the spray solution. Below the critical micelle concentration (CMC) the static surface tension depends on the concentration of the surface active ingredients in the formulation, whereas above the CMC the static surface tension stays constant. The measurement was carried out with the process tensiometer Kruess K 100 using the Wilhelmy-Plate-Method. During the measurement the bottom line of a vertical hanging platinum plate is wetted by the liquid to be analyzed. The force with which the plate is pulled into the liquid is measured and can be converted into the surface tension of the liquid in mN/m. 40 mL of the prepared spray solution are filled into Teflon troughs in the apparatus and the surface tension is detected. The static surface tension is calculated once five successive measuring points match within 0.1 mN/m. The results are summarized in Table 4. Table 4: Example 19 - Increased uptake rate Wheat plants (Triticum aestivum variety Melon) were cultivated in the greenhouse for 6 weeks up to development stage BBCH 39. The plants were transferred to an automatic lab track sprayer and they were sprayed with 125 g/ha epoxiconazole, 125 g/ha fluxapyroxad, and 250 g/ha of the respective adjuvant according to the following parameters: Water amount: 200 l/ha Nozzle type: Air injector, ID 120 02 (Lechler, Germany) Speed: 1 .4 m/s Pressure: 3.33 bar Subsequently to spraying, the plants were cultivated again in the greenhouse under ambient conditions. After 8 days samples of 10 - 15 treated leaves were cut off and weighed. Leaves were cut into small pieces, transferred into glass bottles and washed with 50 % methanol in demineralized water as washing medium for 5 min. Then, the washing medium was separated from the leaves. The leaves were washed again with washing medium for 5 min. Both washing media were combined and diluted for analysis. Finally, the leaves were transferred to a vial containing the extraction medium (75 % methanol, 20 % water and 5 % HCI) and homogenized using a Polytron PT 6100 dispersing unit (Kinemat- ica, CH) for 2 min. 10 ml of the extract were centrifuged with 4000 rpm for 5 min. 2 ml of the supernatant were treated with 2 ml NaOH (0.2 mol/L) and 5 ml cyclohexane, and stirred for 30 min and centrifuged subsequently. 1 ml of the cyclohexane phase was transferred to a glass vial and dried (Liebisch N2 Evaporator, Germany). The residue was solubilized in metha- nol/water 50:50 and analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS. An Agilent 1 100 series HPLC coupled to an Applied Biosystems API 3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, equipped with an electro spray ionization source, was used. The mass spectrometer was operated in the MS/MS positive ion mode with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) using two transitions per analyte at optimized conditions. In addition, unsprayed plants were treated in the same way to see whether they are contaminated. Unsprayed leaves were spiked with standard active ingredient to determine the recovery of active ingredient during washing and extracting steps. According to the recovery rate the measured sample values were corrected. The results were summarized in Table 5. For comparison, the starting material Alcohol Alkoxylate G was tested, which was used to prepare the product of Example 4. For another comparison, the starting material Alcohol Alkoxylate H was tested, which was used to prepare the product of Example 5. The data showed that the uptake rate of epoxiconazol and fluxapyroxad were increased when using the adjuvants according to the invention.

The plants were sprayed (spray volume 200 l/ha) with a composition comprising 50 ppm (10 g/ha) epoxiconazole and 100 ppm (20 g/ha) of the respective adjuvant samples (column "10 g/ha dose rate"). As alternative the dose rate of 50 g/ha epoxiconazole and 100 g/ha adjuvant were tested (column "50 g/ha dose rate"). In the comparative example no adjuvant was added. The plants were further cultivated for ten days at 20-24 °C and 60-90 % relative humidity. Finally, the percentage of the infected leaf area (pustules) was visually inspected. Each value was based on three replicates. The results are summarized in Table 6.
