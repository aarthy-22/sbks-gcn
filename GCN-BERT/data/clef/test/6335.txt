TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to an adhesive sheet, and more specifically, to a blister-resistant adhesive sheet that, when affixed to surface of various plastic molded articles, prevents blistering such as swelling or lifting and allows the surface of its support substrate to be smooth and to have an excellent appearance. BACKGROUND ART Adhesive sheets having a support substrate applied a pressure-sensitive adhesive (adhesive agent) thereto have been conventionally used in a wide variety of fields because of its simplicity, specifically, because the sheets are easy to affix on adherends by pressing force. Meanwhile, plastic molded articles have been frequently used in recent years in accordance with the needs for lighter products. With this, use of adhesive sheets to be affixed on plastic molded articles has increased. Examples of the plastic molded article include those molded from resins such as polycarbonate, polymethyl methacrylate, polystyrene, and ABS. When an adhesive sheet that has a support substrate having gas barrier properties (for example, an adhesive label) is affixed on the surfaces of such a plastic molded article for ornamentation and the like, gas may be generated from the plastic molded article to form air bubbles between the adhesive sheet and the plastic molded article, and thus swelling or lifting, that is, blisters may occur. Occurrence of such blisters impairs the appearance of the labels and significantly reduces the ornamental function as adhesive sheets. To solve such problems, Patent Literature 1, for example, discloses an acrylic adhesive agent composition, as the adhesive agent composition, containing a copolymer prepared by radically polymerizing a (meth)acrylic acid ester, a carboxyl group-containing compound that can copolymerize, and a tertiary amine having a vinyl group. Patent Literature 2 suggests a blister-resistant adhesive sheet using an adhesive agent prepared by blending an aziridine-based crosslinking agent to a copolymer of an acrylic acid ester having an alkyl group having 4 to 12 carbon atoms and 0.1 to 10% by weight of a polar monomer such as acrylic acid or 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate. Additionally, Patent Literature 3 discloses an adhesive sheet that contains, as the components for forming an adhesive agent layer, an adhesive agent component and a curable component that is an acrylic monomer or oligomer. The curable component, however, may reduce the cohesive force of the adhesive agent layer, or may make the adhesive agent layer whitely turbid if having poor compatibility with the adhesive agent component. Furthermore, Patent Literature 4 discloses an adhesive agent composition prepared by blending a resin composition having a specific molecular weight obtained by copolymerizing an alkyl(meth)acrylate ester having 1 to 12 carbon atoms and a carboxyl group-containing unsaturated monomer, with a resin composition having a specific Tg and a specific molecular weight obtained by copolymerizing one or more monomers selected from an alkyl(meth)acrylic acid ester or cycloalkyl(meth)acrylic acid ester having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, benzyl methacrylate, or styrene with an amino group-containing unsaturated monomer. Furthermore, Patent Literature 5 discloses a blister-resistant adhesive agent composition prepared by blending a crosslinking agent having a glycidyl group to a copolymer having a specific molecular weight obtained by copolymerizing an alkyl(meth)acrylic acid ester having 1 to 12 carbon atoms as the main component, a styrenic monomer, a carboxyl group-containing unsaturated monomer, and an amino group-containing unsaturated monomer. Patent Literature 6 discloses a resin composition polymerized in acetone and having a weight average molecular weight of 1.5 million or more and a ratio of the weight average molecular weight/the number average molecule weight of 4.0 or less.

Under such situations, it is an object of the present invention to provide an adhesive sheet that, when affixed to the surface of various plastic molded articles, prevents swelling or lifting, in other words, blistering after a lapse of time to allow the surface of its support substrate to be smooth and to have an excellent appearance, wherein the adhesive sheet can exhibit excellent blister resistance regardless of the type of adhesive agent, and is furthermore easy to manufacture. Solution to Problem The present inventors have extensively studied to solve the problem and found that the problem can be solved by an adhesive sheet including a support substrate, an adhesive agent layer, a continuous void-containing layer composed of a composition containing an adhesive agent and silica particles, and an adhesive agent layer that are laminated in this order, wherein the content by mass of the silica particles in the continuous void-containing layer is in a specific range.

Advantageous Effects of Invention The adhesive sheet of the present invention has a layer structure including a support substrate, an adhesive agent layer (X), a continuous void-containing layer containing an adhesive agent and silica particles in a specific proportion, and an adhesive agent layer (Y) that are laminated in this order. The present invention thus can provide an adhesive sheet that has a support substrate whose surface is smooth and has an excellent appearance, and that exhibits excellent blister resistance regardless of the type of adhesive agent, wherein the adhesive sheet also has water resistance and solvent resistance comparable to adhesive sheets containing no silica particles, and is easy to manufacture.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS An adhesive sheet of the present invention will be described first. The adhesive sheet of the present invention is an adhesive sheet including a support substrate, an adhesive agent layer (X), a continuous void-containing layer composed of a composition containing an adhesive agent and silica particles, and an adhesive agent layer (Y) that are laminated in this order, wherein the content by mass of the silica particles in the continuous void-containing layer is from 25 to 60%. [Support Substrate] The support substrate used in the adhesive sheet of the present invention is not particularly limited, and various substrates conventionally used as the support substrate in adhesive sheets can be used. Example of the such support substrate include plastic films such as polyester films including polyethylene terephthalate films, polybutylene terephthalate films, and polyethylene naphthalate films, polyethylene films, polypropylene films, polyvinyl chloride films, polyvinylidene chloride films, polyvinyl alcohol films, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer films, polystyrene films, polycarbonate films, polymethylpentene films, polysulfone films, polyether ether ketone films, polyether sulfone films, polyphenylene sulfide films, polyether imide films, polyimide films, fluorine resin films, polyamide films, acrylic resin films, norbornene-based resin films, and cycloolefin resin films. Of these, polyethylene terephthalate films are preferable. Polyethylene naphthalate films, polyimide films, and polyether imide films, which have a high glass transition point (Tg), can be used in applications requiring heat resistance and the like. Furthermore, polyvinyl chloride films, polyvinylidene chloride films, fluorine resin films, and acrylic resin films, which have weatherability, can be used in applications requiring weatherability and the like. The thickness of this plastic film is not particularly limited, and is usually from about 5 to about 200 μm, preferably from 25 to 120 μm, more preferably from 30 to 90 μm, and still more preferably from 40 to 60 μm. [Metal Layer] The support substrate in the present invention is preferably a non-breathable substrate, which further clearly exerts an effect of the present invention to prevent blisters. An example of this non-breathable substrate that can be used includes a substrate having a metal layer on the plastic film aforementioned. Examples of the method for forming the metal layer that can be employed include a method for depositing, for example, a metal having metal luster, specifically aluminum, tin, chromium, and titanium by a PVD method such as vacuum deposition, sputtering, and ion plating, or a method for affixing metal foil having metal luster, specifically aluminum foil, tin foil, chromium foil, and titanium foil via one of various adhesive agent layers usually used. Particularly, the method for depositing a metal having metal luster is advantageous from the viewpoints of the appearance and cost effectiveness of an adhesive sheet to be obtained. In order to improve the adhesion properties with a layer to be mounted on the surface, these plastic films also can be subjected to surface treatment by an oxidation method or a roughening method or primer treatment as required. Examples of the oxidation method aforementioned include corona discharge treatment, plasma discharge treatment, chromium acid treatment (wet type), hot-air treatment, and ozone and ultraviolet irradiation treatment. Examples of the roughening method include sandblast method and solvent treatment. Such surface treatment is arbitrarily selected depending on the type of plastic film. In terms of effects, handleability and the like, corona discharge treatment is preferably used in general. [Continuous Void-Containing Layer] A continuous void-containing layer constituting an adhesive sheet of the present invention (sometimes simply referred to as a void-containing layer hereinbelow) is a layer composed of a composition containing an adhesive agent and silica particles, wherein the content by mass of the silica particles in the void-containing layer is necessarily from 25 to 60%, preferably from 28 to 55%, more preferably from 30 to 55%, still more preferably from 30 to 50%, and further still more preferably from 35 to 45%. A content by mass of the silica particles aforementioned of less than 25% cannot provide voids, and may result in insufficient blister resistance. On the other hand, a content by mass of more than 60% may reduce the film strength to thereby cause the following problems: the water resistance and chemical resistance are reduced; and, pressing force in affixing an adhesive sheet may make a dent to cause a defective appearance. It is to be noted that the content by mass of the silica particles in the void-containing layer can be calculated by the following expression (2); [in-line-formulae]Content by mass of the silica particles=[mass of the silica particles/total mass of the continuous void-containing layer]×100 (2)[/in-line-formulae] [Increment in Thickness Due to Voids] The increment in thickness due to voids of the void-containing layer is preferably from 120 to 170%, more preferably from 130 to 165%, still more preferably from 130 to 160%, further still more preferably from 135 to 150%, and further still more preferably from 135 to 145%. An increment in thickness due to the voids of 120% or more allows gas generated from plastic molded articles and the like to be easier to escape and makes the blister resistance of the adhesive sheet excellent. On the other hand, an increment in thickness of 170% or less makes the film strength higher and the water resistance and chemical resistance excellent. [Method for calculating the increment in thickness due to voids] The increment in thickness due to voids of the void-containing layer can be calculated as follows. First, the measurement of the amount applied is divided by the specific gravity of the dried coating film to calculate the film thickness containing no bubbles (underlined part). The measured film thickness is divided by the calculated film thickness as in the following expression (1) to calculate the increment in thickness due to voids. [in-line-formulae]Increment in thickness due to voids (%)=Measured film thickness×100/(amount applied/specific gravity of the dried coating film) (1)[/in-line-formulae] It is to be noted that a measured film thickness is a value of the thickness of the void-containing layer measured with a constant pressure thickness gauge (manufactured by TECLOCK Corporation, product name “PG-02”) in conformity with JIS K 7130. The amount applied is the dry mass of the void-containing layer per unit area (g/m2). The specific gravity of the dry coating film (g/cm3) is a value calculated from the mass fraction of the specific gravity of each material. [Voids] Silica particles that are a material to form the continuous void-containing layer are in fact constituted of secondary particles. The voids in the continuous void-containing layer thus include, in addition to the voids existing between the secondary particles, voids existing in the secondary particles. Accordingly, the continuous void-containing layer has a region where voids existing between the secondary particles communicate with voids existing in the secondary particles to form holes (micropores) toward the thickness direction. [Silica Particles] Silica particles that are a material to form the void-containing layer may be any of dry silica, wet silica, or organically modified silica, or may be a mixture of two or more of these. The content by mass of the silica in the silica particles is preferably from 70 to 100% by mass, more preferably from 85 to 100% by mass, and still more preferably from 90 to 100% by mass. The volume-average secondary particle size of the silica particles that are a material to form the void-containing layer is preferably from 0.5 to 10 μm, more preferably from 1 to 8 μm, and still more preferably from 1.5 to 5 μm. The volume-average secondary particle size of the silica particles can be determined by measuring the particle size distribution using Multisizer 3 (manufactured by Beckman Coulter, Inc.) and the like in accordance with the Coulter counter method. It is to be noted that the void-containing layer may contain, together with the silica particles, other inorganic particles such as titanium oxide, barium sulfate, alumina, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, and glass beads, and furthermore, organic particles such as acrylic beads as long as not impairing the object of the present invention. [Adhesive Agent] The continuous void-containing layer contains an adhesive agent as a component. The reasons are that adhesion properties at the interface between the continuous void-containing layer and the adhesive agent layer are easily obtainable, and that a material having adhesiveness can easily achieve larger adhesive strength to an adherend than a material having no adhesiveness due to the influence of bulk consequently when both materials have the same thickness. The adhesive agent to constitute the continuous void-containing layer is not particularly limited, and examples of the adhesive agent that can be used include various types of adhesive agent such as rubber-based adhesive agents, silicone-based adhesive agents, and acrylic adhesive agents. From the viewpoints of the performance of the adhesive agent and the weatherability, acrylic adhesive agents are preferable. Additionally, the adhesive agent may be either of a solvent form or an emulsion form. It is to be noted that a solvent adhesive agent may contain a crosslinking agent as necessary. The acrylic adhesive agent preferably contains a crosslinking agent as an adhesive component together with a (meth)acrylic acid ester copolymer having a weight average molecular weight of 100000 to 1500000. From the viewpoint of the porosity, the storage shear modulus of the adhesive agent after crosslinking at 100° C. is preferably 9.0×103 Pa or more, more preferably 1.0×104 Pa or more, and still more preferably 0.0×104 Pa or more. A storage shear modulus of 9.0×103 Pa or more allows voids to remain, and thus the blister resistant will be excellent. The storage shear modulus can be determined by measurement using a viscoelasticity measuring apparatus (manufactured by Rheometrics, Inc., apparatus name: DYNAMIC ANALYZER RDA II) at a frequency of 1 Hz. Additionally, from the viewpoint of the adhesion properties of the interface between the continuous void-containing layer and the adhesive agent layer, the adhesive agent used as the adhesive agent constituting the continuous void-containing layer is preferably the same as used in the adhesive agent layer described below. Examples of the crosslinking agent include polyisocyanate compounds, epoxy resins, melamine resins, urea resins, dialdehydes, methylol polymers, aziridine-based compounds, metal chelate compounds, metal alkoxides, and metal salts, and a polyisocyanate compounds are preferably used. This crosslinking agent can be blended with respect to 100 parts by mass of the solid content of the (meth)acrylic acid ester copolymer aforementioned in an amount of preferably 0 to 30 parts by mass, more preferably 1 to 15 parts by mass, still more preferably 2 to 10 parts by mass, and further still more preferably 3 to 7 parts by mass. Examples of the polyisocyanate compounds here include aromatic polyisocyanates such as tolylene diisocyanate, diphenylmethane diisocyanate, and xylylene diisocyanate, aliphatic polyisocyanates such as hexamethylene diisocyanate, alicyclic polyisocyanates such as isophorone diisocyanate and hydrogenated diphenylmethane diisocyanate, and biuret products and isocyanurate products thereof, as well as adduct products that are reaction products from reaction with a low-molecular active hydrogen-containing compound such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, trimethylolpropane, and castor oil. These crosslinking agents may be used singly or in combination of two or more thereof. The thickness of the continuous void-containing layer is preferably from 5 to 100 μm, more preferably from 7 to 50 μm, still more preferably from 10 to 30 μm, and further still more preferably from 15 to 25 μm. When the thickness is 5 μm or more, a sufficient thickness for embedding silica particles can be secured, and a continuous void-containing layer having lower roughness can be formed. Blister resistance also can be secured. A thickness of 100 μm or less is economically preferable because the water resistance is not impaired, and the amount of the silica particles used also can be reduced. The continuous void-containing layer is formed by applying a coating liquid for a continuous void-containing layer, the coating liquid containing the adhesive agent and the silica particles. [Adhesive Agent Layers (X) and (Y)] FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional schematic view of an example of the structure of an adhesive sheet according to the present invention. As shown in FIG. 1, an adhesive sheet 10 of the present invention has a structure in which a support substrate 1 having a metal layer 2 on the surface, an adhesive agent layer (X) 3 on the metal layer 2, the continuous void-containing layer 4 aforementioned, an adhesive agent layer (Y) 5, and a release sheet 6 are laminated in this order. The adhesive agent constituting the adhesive agent layer (X) and the adhesive agent layer (Y) in the adhesive sheet of the present invention is not particularly limited because the adhesive agent layer itself requires no blister-resistant function. Although various types of adhesive agent such as rubber-based adhesive agents, silicone-based adhesive agents, and acrylic adhesive agents can be used, acrylic adhesive agents are preferable from the viewpoints of the performance of the adhesive agent and the weatherability. Additionally, the adhesive agent may be either of a solvent form or an emulsion form. It is to be noted that a crosslinking agent may be contained as necessary. The thickness of the adhesive agent layer (X) and the adhesive agent layer (Y) in the adhesive sheet of the present invention is preferably from 5 to 50 μm, more preferably from 7 to 35 μm, and further still more preferably from 10 to 30 The ratio between the thickness of the adhesive agent layer (X) and the thickness of the continuous void-containing layer [adhesive agent layer (X)/continuous void-containing layer] is preferably from 0.05 to 10, more preferably from 0.1 to 5, still more preferably from 0.2 to 2, and further still more preferably from 0.3 to 0.8 from the viewpoint of satisfying both of an excellent appearance and blister resistance. The ratio between the thickness of the adhesive agent layer (Y) and the thickness of the continuous void-containing layer [adhesive agent layer (Y)/continuous void-containing layer] is preferably from 0.05 to 10, more preferably from 0.1 to 5, still more preferably from 0.2 to 2, and further still more preferably from 0.3 to 0.8 from the viewpoint of satisfying both of an excellent appearance and blister resistance. These two adhesive agent layers (X) and (Y) may have the same composition or different compositions. The composition of the adhesive agent layer is not particularly limited. The adhesive agent same as used in the continuous void-containing layer aforementioned may be used. Methods for manufacturing an adhesive sheet of the present invention will be now described. [Method for Manufacturing an Adhesive Sheet I] The method for manufacturing an adhesive sheet I of the present invention is a method for manufacturing an adhesive sheet including a support substrate, an adhesive agent layer (X), a continuous void-containing layer, and an adhesive agent layer (Y) that are laminated in this order, wherein the method is characterized in that at least two or more of the adhesive agent layer (X), the continuous void-containing layer, and the adhesive agent layer (Y) are simultaneously applied by a multi-layer coater. In the manufacturing method I, examples of the coater used in simultaneous application by a multi-layer coater include curtain coaters and die coaters. Of these, die coaters are suitable in terms of handleability. [Method for Manufacturing an Adhesive Sheet II] The method for manufacturing an adhesive sheet II of the present invention is a method for manufacturing an adhesive sheet including a support substrate, an adhesive agent layer (X), a continuous void-containing layer, and an adhesive agent layer (Y) that are laminated in this order, wherein the method is characterized in that the adhesive agent layer (X), the continuous void-containing layer, and the adhesive agent layer (Y) are each laminated by bonding. In the manufacturing method II, examples of the method of laminating by bonding that can be used include a method comprising applying and drying a predetermined adhesive agent on a peeling-treated surface of a release sheet in accordance with a conventionally known method such that the thickness after drying reaches preferably 5 to 50 μm, more preferably 7 to 35 μm, and further still more preferably 10 to 30 μm to fabricate an adhesive agent sheet having a release sheet, and subsequently bonding this sheet to a continuous void-containing layer using a laminating roll. In the manufacturing method II, examples of the coater used in forming and applying each layer include air knife coaters, blade coaters, bar coaters, gravure coaters, roll coaters, roll knife coaters, curtain coaters, die coaters, knife coaters, screen coaters, Meyer bar coaters, and kiss coaters. Of these, in terms of handleability, roll knife coaters and die coaters are suitable. Alternatively, it is also possible to use a manufacturing method described below, in other words, a method for manufacturing an adhesive sheet including a support substrate, an adhesive agent layer (X), a continuous void-containing layer, and adhesive agent layer (Y) that are laminated in this order, wherein at least two layers of the adhesive agent layer (X), the continuous void-containing layer, and the adhesive agent layer (Y) are laminated by a wet-on-wet or wet-on-dry process, which is not multi-layer simultaneous application. It is to be noted that the wet-on-wet process is a method that includes applying, for example, a coating liquid for forming an adhesive agent layer (X) and further applying a coating liquid for forming a continuous void-containing layer thereon without dry treatment. In contrast, the wet-on-dry process is a method that includes applying, for example, a coating liquid for forming an adhesive agent layer (X), applying a coating liquid for forming a continuous void-containing layer thereon, carrying out dry treatment, and then, applying a coating liquid for forming an adhesive agent layer (Y). Alternatively, it is also possible to use an method that includes fabricating a substrate-less adhesive sheet having an adhesive agent layer (X), a continuous void-containing layer, and adhesive agent layer (Y) that are laminated in this order, and laminating a support substrate thereafter. In this case, the substrate-less adhesive sheet may have a release sheet as described later for protecting the adhesive agent layer. (Release Sheet) Examples of the substrate of the release sheet used in the method for fabricating an adhesive sheet aforementioned include films formed from various resins such as polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyacrylate, or various paper materials such as polyethylene-laminated paper, polypropylene-laminated paper, clay-coated paper, resin-coated paper, glassine paper, and high-quality paper. Such a substrate can be used as a release sheet, after subjected to peeling treatment as necessary on its surface to be bonded to an adhesive agent layer. Examples of the peeling treatment include formation of a peeling agent layer composed of a peeling agent such as silicone-based resins, long-chain alkyl-based resins, and fluorine-based resins. Although the thickness of the release sheet is not particularly limited, it is usually from 20 to 200 μm, preferably from 25 to 180 μm, and more preferably from 50 to 170 μm. The adhesive sheet of the present invention thus obtained is affixed to plastic molded articles of polycarbonate, polymethyl methacrylate, polystyrene, ABS resins, and the like to thereby enable effective prevention of blistering. EXAMPLES The present invention now will be described by Examples in further detail, but the present invention is not limited by these Examples in any way. It is to be noted that the blister resistance and water resistance of the adhesive sheet obtained in each example were determined by the methods described below. <Evaluation of the Blister Resistance> Adhesive sheets having a size of 50 mm×50 mm, from which the release sheet had been peeled off, were pressure-bonded to a polymethyl methacrylate plate [manufactured by MITSUBISHI RAYON CO., LTD., “ACRYLITE” L001”], a polycarbonate plate [manufactured by MITSUBISHI GAS CHEMICAL COMPANY, INC., “Iupilon Sheet NF-2000VU”], and a polystyrene plate [manufactured by KYOEI JUSHI Corporation, “Dialite 201B W1001”] each having a thickness of 2 mm and a size of 70 mm×150 mm using a squeegee. After left at 23° C. for 12 hours, these plates were left in a hot-air dryer at 80° C. for 1.5 hours, and then, in a hot-air dryer at 90° C. for 1.5 hours. The blistering condition after heating acceleration was observed and evaluated according to the decision criteria below. A: No blister was visually confirmed at all. B: Blisters were visually confirmed partially. C: Blisters were visually confirmed across the entire surface. <Evaluation of the Water Resistance> An adhesive sheet having a size of 50 mm×50 mm, from which the release sheet was peeled off, was pressure-bonded to a polymethyl methacrylate plate [manufactured by MITSUBISHI RAYON CO., LTD., “ACRYLITE” L001] having a thickness of 2 mm and a size of 70 mm×150 mm using a squeegee. After left at 23° C. for 12 hours, the plate was immersed in warm water at 40° C. for 24 hours, and then the water immersion condition was observed and evaluated according to the decision criteria below. A: The portion lifted and peeled by water immersion was less than 3 mm from the edge. F: The portion lifted and peeled by water immersion was 3 mm or more from the edge. <Measurement of the Volume-Average Secondary Particle Size of the Silica Particles> Furthermore, the volume-average secondary particle size of the silica particles in the continuous void-containing layer was determined by measuring the particle size distribution using Multisizer 3 (manufactured by Beckman Coulter, Inc.) in accordance with the Coulter counter method. <Measurement of the Increment in Thickness and the Content by Mass of the Silica Particles> The increment in thickness due to voids in the continuous void-containing layer and the content by mass of the silica particles were calculated respectively by the expression (1) and the expression (2) described hereinabove. <Measurement of the Film Thickness> The film thickness was measured as the thickness of the void-containing layer with a constant pressure thickness gauge (manufactured by TECLOCK Corporation, product name “PG-02”) in conformity with JIS K 7130.

The silica particles were dispersed in the acrylic adhesive agent to prepare a silica-dispersed adhesive agent composition (solid content: 37% by mass). Furthermore, to 100 parts by mass of this adhesive agent composition, 1.13 parts by mass (a solid content of 1.69 parts by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of the acrylic adhesive agent) of an isocyanate-based cross-linking agent (trade name: “CORONATE L”, solid content: 75% by mass, manufactured by Nippon Polyurethane Industry Co., Ltd.) was added, and the mixed solvent having a volume ratio between toluene and MEK of 1:1 was added to obtain a coating liquid for a continuous void-containing layer (B1) having a solid content of 33% by mass. <Fabrication of an Adhesive Sheet> The support substrate used was a polyethylene terephthalate film having an aluminum-deposited layer on one surface (manufactured by Lintec Corporation, product name “FNS MATTN50”, thickness: 50 μm). The release sheet used was release paper [manufactured by Lintec Corporation, product name “SP-11BL Ivory”, thickness: 166 μm]. The peeling-treated surface of this release sheet was subjected to three-layer simultaneous application by a multi-layer die coater using the coating liquid for forming an adhesive agent layer (A) and the coating liquid for a continuous void-containing layer (B1) such that an adhesive agent layer, a continuous void-containing layer, and an adhesive agent layer were laminated in this order, and dried at 100° C. for 2 minutes to form an adhesive agent layer having a thickness of 10 μm, a continuous void-containing layer having a thickness of 20 μm, and an adhesive agent layer having a thickness of 10 μm. These layers were bonded using a laminating roll to the aluminum-deposited surface of the support substrate to fabricate an adhesive sheet. The content by mass of the silica particles in the continuous void-containing layer was 36.7%, and the increment in thickness due to voids was 136%. Example 2 To 100 parts by mass (solid content: 46 parts by mass) of an acrylic adhesive agent (trade name: “Oribain BPS-4891”, manufactured by TOYOCHEM CO., LTD, solid content: 46% by mass), 30.67 parts by mass of silica particles (trade name: “Nipsil E-200A”, volume-average secondary particle size: 3 μm, manufactured by TOSOH SILICA CORPORATION) and a mixed solvent having a volume ratio between toluene and MEK of 1:1 were added. The silica particles were dispersed in the acrylic adhesive agent to prepare a silica-dispersed adhesive agent composition (solid content: 35% by mass). Furthermore, to 100 parts by mass of this adhesive agent composition, 1.03 parts by mass (solid content of 1.69 parts by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of the acrylic adhesive agent) of an isocyanate-based cross-linking agent (trade name: “CORONATE L”, solid content: 75% by mass, manufactured by Nippon Polyurethane Industry Co., Ltd.) was added, and the mixed solvent having a volume ratio between toluene and MEK of 1:1 was added to obtain a coating liquid for a continuous void-containing layer (B2) having a solid content of 33% by mass.
