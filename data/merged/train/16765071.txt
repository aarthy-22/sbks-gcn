Detection of 6-nitrotryptophan in proteins by Western blot analysis and its application for peroxynitrite-treated PC12 cells.
We have previously reported on the formation of 6-nitrotryptophan by the reaction of reactive nitrogen species with a tryptophan residue in human Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) (F. Yamakura et al., J. Biochem.
138 (2005) 57-69).
Here, we report on the preparation of anti-6-nitrotryptophan antiserum by using synthesized 6-nitrotryptophan-conjugated keyhole limpet hemocyanin as an antigen and the purification of the antibody by using a 6-nitrotryptophan-conjugated affinity column.
The purified antibody was immunoreactive with 6-nitrotryptophan residue containing Cu, Zn-SOD but not immunoreactive with Cu, Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD, bovine serum albumin, and 3-nitrotyrosine residue containing Mn-SOD.
Nitro group of 6-nitrotryptophan was reduced by sodium hydrosulfite to form 6-aminotryptophan as a major product.
The reduced 6-nitrotryptophan residues lost its immunoreactivity with the antibody.
We detected different immunoreactive bands between using antibody for 6-nitrotryptophan residues and that for 3-nitrotyrosine residues in crude extracts of neuron-like PC12 cells treated with peroxynitrite by a Western blot analysis.
Western blot analysis for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed nine intensively stained immunoreactive spots for 6-nitrotryptophan residues in the peroxynitrite-treated PC12 cells, which were subjected to trypsin digestion and LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis.
We identified M2 pyruvate kinase, elongation factor 2, mitochondrial aconitase, pyruvate carboxylase, and heat shock protein HSP90alpha as candidates for 6-nitrotryptophan residues containing proteins, with peptide coverage over 10%, in crude extracts of peroxynitrite-treated PC12 cells.
