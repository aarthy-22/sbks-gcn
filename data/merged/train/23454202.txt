Curcumin loaded solid lipid nanoparticles: An efficient formulation approach for cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury in rats.
SCOPE: To evaluate curcumin loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (C-SLNs) in the experimental paradigm of cerebral ischemia (BCCAO model) in rats.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Oral administration of free curcumin and C-SLNs (25 and 50mg/kg) was started 5days prior and continued for 3days after BCCAO.
Alleviation in behavioral, oxidative and nitrosative stress, acetylcholinesterase, mitochondrial enzyme complexes, and physiological parameters were assessed.
Confirmation of effective brain delivery of C-SLNs (p.o) was done using biodistribution studies in mice and confocal microscopy of rat brain section.
There was an improvement of 90% in cognition and 52% inhibition of acetylcholinesterase versus cerebral ischemic group (I/R).
Neurological scoring improved by 79%.
Levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione, and mitochondrial complex enzyme activities were significantly increased, while lipid peroxidation, nitrite, and acetylcholinesterase levels decreased (p<0.05) after C-SLNs administration.
It is noteworthy to report the restoration of SOD, GSH, catalase, and mitochondrial complex enzyme levels equivalent to sham control values.
Gamma-scintigraphic studies show 16.4 and 30 times improvement in brain bioavailability (AUC) upon oral and i.v administration of C-SLNs versus solubilized curcumin (C-S).
CONCLUSIONS: Study indicates protective role of curcumin against cerebral ischemic insult; provided it is packaged suitably for improved brain delivery.
