Novel 5-(benzyloxy)pyridin-2(1H)-one derivatives as potent c-Met inhibitors.
A series of novel 5-(benzyloxy)pyridin-2(1H)-ones were designed, synthesized and biologically evaluated for c-Met inhibition.
Various amides and benzoimidazoles at C-3 position were investigated.
A potent compound 12b with a c-Met IC50 of 12nM was identified.
This compound exhibited potent inhibition of EBC-1 cell associated with c-Met constitutive activation and showed high selectivity for c-Met than other tested 11 kinases.
The binding model 12b with c-Met was disclosed by docking analysis.
