The role of long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in reducing lipid peroxidation among elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment: a case-control study.
The present work explores the effect of dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) intake on lipid peroxidation among mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients.
The plasma lipid hydroperoxide (LPO) levels in 67 MCI patients were compared to those of 134 healthy elderly controls.
Omega-3 PUFA intake was assessed using an interviewer-administered food frequency questionnaire.
Apolipoprotein E genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme digestion.
The association between various confounders and lipid peroxidation was evaluated using regression analysis.
The influence of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) intake on LPO level was investigated.
The results revealed that LPO levels were significantly higher in the MCI group than in the control group.
Inverse correlations were found between DHA and EPA intake and LPO level among the MCI group.
LPO levels decreased significantly with increasing DHA and EPA intake.
In summary, the findings revealed that DHA and EPA can play a role in alleviating oxidative stress and reducing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases.
