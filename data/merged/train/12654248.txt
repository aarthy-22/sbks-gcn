ANKTM1, a TRP-like channel expressed in nociceptive neurons, is activated by cold temperatures.
Mammals detect temperature with specialized neurons in the peripheral nervous system.
Four TRPV-class channels have been implicated in sensing heat, and one TRPM-class channel in sensing cold.
The combined range of temperatures that activate these channels covers a majority of the relevant physiological spectrum sensed by most mammals, with a significant gap in the noxious cold range.
Here, we describe the characterization of ANKTM1, a cold-activated channel with a lower activation temperature compared to the cold and menthol receptor, TRPM8.
ANKTM1 is a distant family member of TRP channels with very little amino acid similarity to TRPM8.
It is found in a subset of nociceptive sensory neurons where it is coexpressed with TRPV1/VR1 (the capsaicin/heat receptor) but not TRPM8.
Consistent with the expression of ANKTM1, we identify noxious cold-sensitive sensory neurons that also respond to capsaicin but not to menthol.
