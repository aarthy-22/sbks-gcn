Protective effect of vitamin E and epicatechin against nicotine-induced oxidative stress in rats.
Nicotine is a major pharmacologically active and addictive component of tobacco smoke, which is regarded to be a primary risk factor in the development of cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases.
Epicatechin is one of the most potent antioxidants present in the human diet.
Particularly high levels of this compound are found in tea, apples and chocolate.
It has been reported that tea extracts and/or its constituents have antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidative, antitumor and antimutagenic activities.
Vitamin E is a major lipid-soluble antioxidant vitamin and free radical scavenger, presents as an integral component of cellular membranes and has important biological functions.
The primary mechanism by which vitamin E is proposed to prevent cancer is through their antioxidant properties.
The goal of this study is to evaluate the effect of epicatechin alone or combined with vitamin E in inhibiting the oxidative stress induced by nicotine in rats.
Results obtained indicated that there was a significant elevation in the levels of malondialdhyde (MDA) in nicotine injected rats.
The combined treatment (epicatechin + Vit E) group showed a potential reduction of these parameters more than individual treatment.
The activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase were found significantly higher in combined treated than untreated rats.
In nicotine group, a negative significant correlation between reduced glutathione and MDA (r = -0.92) was observed.
In conclusion, these results suggested that the supplementation of diet with epicatechin and vitamin E provided antioxidant defense with strong chemopreventive activity against nicotine-induced carcinogenesis.
