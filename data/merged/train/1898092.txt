The effect of ligand binding on the proteolytic pattern of methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase.
Native rat liver methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase was proteolyzed by lysylendopeptidase C, chymotrypsin, and trypsin to generate different cleavage fragments of molecular masses: 50, 8, 55, 44, 39, 53, 45, and 40 kDa.
A proteolytic cleavage map of MMSDH was constructed based on sequencing data and a comparison of appearance and degradation rates of the different protein fragments as shown by SDS-PAGE.
NAD+ was highly effective as a protector against proteolysis in both the N-terminal and the C-terminal parts of the intact enzyme.
NADH did not efficiently protect the intact enzyme; however, it stabilized proteolytic fragment L50 from further degradation.
This suggests that the NAD(+)-binding domain is not destroyed by cleavage of the N-terminal part of MMSDH.
CoA had no effect on the proteolytic cleavage patterns of MMSDH.
However, CoA esters reduced the protective effect of NAD+ with an order of effectiveness of acetyl-CoA greater than propionyl-CoA greater than butyryl-CoA. p-Nitrophenyl acetate, substrate for esterase activity by the enzyme, partially prevented the protective effect of NAD+ against proteolysis.
These results suggest that S-acylation of the enzyme prevents a stabilizing conformational change induced in MMSDH by NAD+ binding.
