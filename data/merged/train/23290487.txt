Anti-diabetic property of Tinospora cordifolia and its active compound is mediated through the expression of Glut-4 in L6 myotubes.
Tinospora cordifolia is a well reported plant possessing numerous medicinal values including anti-diabetic property.
Aim of the present study is to study the mechanism of action of Tinospora cordifolia and its active compound in differentiated myocytes, L6 cells.
Key marker of diabetes in cells is the insulin dependent glucose transporter-4 (Glut-4) which also responds to exogenous chemicals, and is over expressed up to 5- and 4-fold, by Tinospora cordifolia and palmatine, respectively.
Next to Glut-4, the predominant protein influencing glucose metabolism is PPARα and γ whose expressions were also positively modulated.
Further, the inhibitors of insulin pathway prevented glucose uptake mediated by Tinospora cordifolia and palmatine which shows that the activity is majorly mediated through insulin pathway.
