Significance of the transient receptor potential canonical 2 (TRPC2) channel in the regulation of rat thyroid FRTL-5 cell proliferation, migration, adhesion and invasion.
Mammalian transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are involved in many physiologically important processes.
Here, we have studied the significance of the TRPC2 channel in the regulation of rat thyroid FRTL-5 cell proliferation, migration, adhesion and invasion, using stable TRPC2 (shTRPC2) knock-down cells.
In the shTRPC2 cells, proliferation was decreased due to a prolonged G1/S cell cycle phase.
The tumor suppressor p53 and the cyclin-dependant kinase inhibitors p27 and p21 were upregulated.
Cell invasion, adhesion and migration were also attenuated in shTRPC2 cells, probably due to decreased activity of both Rac and calpain, and a decreased secretion and activity of matrix metalloproteinase 2.
The attenuated proliferation, migration, invasion and ATP-evoked calcium entry was mimicked by overexpressing a non-conducting, truncated TRPC2 (TRPC2-DN) in wild type cells, and was reversed by overexpression of TRPC2-GFP in shTRPC2 cells.
In conclusion, TRPC2 is an important regulator of rat thyroid cell function.
