Acetazolamide inhibits aquaporin-1 protein expression and angiogenesis.
AIM: To study effects of acetazolamide on aquaporin-1 (AQP(1)) protein expression and angiogenesis.
METHODS: Establishing Lewis-lung-carcinoma model, the localization of AQP(1) in tumor tissues was investigated by immunohistochemical methods; The biological activity of acetazolamide was detected by endothelial cells proliferation test (MTT) assay and chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) vascular inhibition test.
RESULTS: Immunohistochemical localization of AQP(1) in mice tumor was labeled in capillaries, post capillary venules endothelial cells.
After being treated with acetazolamide, the number of capillaries and post capillary venules was significantly decreased in tumor tissue.
Acetazolamide showed significant inhibitory effect on angiogenesis in CAM and endothelial cell proliferation.
CONCLUSION: Acetazolamide might be identified and developed as one of potential lead compounds for a new therapeutic intervention in inhibiting cancer angiogenesis.
