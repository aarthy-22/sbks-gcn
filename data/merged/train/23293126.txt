Effects of smoking on the oxidant/antioxidant balance and the blood lipids in pesticide sprayers.
The present study was conducted on 80 pesticide male sprayers (42 nonsmokers and 38 smokers).
Our aim was to estimate the smoking effects on blood lipids and oxidant/antioxidant status in pesticide sprayers.
Results revealed that cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and glutathion peroxidase (GPx) enzyme were significantly higher in the 38 smoker sprayers than in the 42 nonsmoker sprayers.
Cholesterol and LDL were correlated with smoking index and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme and zinc (Zn) were inversely correlated with duration of pesticides' exposure.
In nonsmokers, LDL and cholesterol were negatively correlated with SOD and correlated with malondialdehyde (MDA), and cholesterol was negatively correlated with Zn.
HDL was negatively correlated with MDA in all the sprayers, but was correlated with GPx in smokers and with Zn in nonsmokers.
In smokers, LDL was negatively correlated with GPx, HDL was negatively correlated with MDA and triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein were negatively correlated with Zn.
MDA was negatively correlated with SOD, GPx and Zn.
Smoking and pesticide exposure could be responsible for hyperlipidemia and oxidative stress.
Therefore, improvement in the antioxidant status is mandatory for pesticide sprayers especially the ones who smoke.
