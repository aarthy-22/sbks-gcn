Field of the invention The present invention relates to coated dehydrated microorganisms having enhanced stability and viability. Background of the invention Freeze-drying processes are frequently used to preserve microorganisms. Indeed, the low operating temperatures of freeze-drying processes lead to minimal damage in microorganisms. Moreover, it is known in the art that low storage temperatures can be an essential element in maintaining the viability and stability of such freeze-dried cells. It is also known in the art, that cells which are freeze-dried in the presence of protective agents are better suited to maintain their viability and stability than cells which are freeze-dried without the addition of said protective agents. For example, US 6,919,172 (Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation) relates to the use of a protective mixture (i.e. sucrose and potassium phosphates) mixed with biological material in order to form a preservation medium, prior to the biological medium undergoing at least one preservation process (eg. freezing, freeze-drying, vacuum-drying or spray-drying). After being subjected to a preservation process, the biological material is capable of remaining stable when stored in dry conditions at room temperature. However, the probiotic microorganisms of US 6,919,172 which have been preserved to provide increased stability during shipping and storage in sealed containers cannot usually withstand the simultaneous high temperature and/or high humidity conditions which are typically encountered in long-term storage and secondary processes used in feed products, food products (e.g. cereals, nutritional bars, recombined cheese, infant formulas), consumer healthcare products (including dietary supplements, nutraceuticals, over-the-counter products) as well as agri-products. Indeed, the viable microoganisms are often inactivated by heat and/or moisture and/or other processing conditions or storage conditions, thereby decreasing their viability in the final product over time, during storage and/or during consumption, in such a way that the desired effect of the final product containing the microorganisms is eventually lost. In order to overcome this problem, numerous coating processes for microorganisms have been developed to protect them against undesirable elements such as high temperature and high humidity levels. These coating processes are often based on coating materials such as fats or low permeability polymers such as shellac and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC). For example, US 7,157,258 (Lallemand) deals with coating of dehydrated microorganisms by using hydrophobic barriers such as fat and waxes with melting points greater than 60°C, while EP 1753440 B1 (Merck), US 6,365,148 (Il Yang Pharm Co. Ltd.) and EP 0778778 B1 (University New South Wales) use polymeric barriers such as HPMC or starch. These moisture barriers are intended to provide protection of the dehydrated microorganisms by preventing or delaying penetration of water into the coating, thereby avoiding diffusion of moisture to the underlaying dehydrated microorganism. If the coating allows moisture to pass, then the dehydrated microorganism may absorb moisture, thereby altering its viability. However, the Applicant has prepared dehydrated microorganisms coated with commonly used compounds such as fats, shellac or HPMC and noticed that the viability of such microorganisms containing products was not sufficiently maintained. Indeed, as can be seen in the results section of the present patent application (especially Example 4, Table 5 and Example 7, Table 8), the materials used in the prior art to coat the microorganisms do not enhance the thermostability of the microorganisms nor provide enhanced viability over a longer period of time in medium or high humidity environments when compared to non-coated dehydrated microorganisms. DE3432394C1 discloses dried yeast particles encapsulated with a crust of 100% sodium chloride. US4956295A describes an admixture of dried bacteria with a carrier composed primarily of inorganic salt. EP1514553A1 describes a method for double-coating bacteria with a protein and a polysaccharide. WO2008/035332A1 describes microencapsulated and coated microorganisms. Typically, the coating comprises a substance selected from the group consisting of: wax, shellac, resistant starch, zein protein, ethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, amylose acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose phthalate, an ethylacrylate, and a methylmethacrylate. Consequently, despite the teachings above, there still exists a need in the art for coated dehydrated microorganisms, whereby the microorganisms are able to retain most of their activity during and after manufacturing and are able to resist the damaging conditions encountered for example in secondary processes used for the preparation of feed/food products, consumer healthcare products or agri-products or during long term storage of these products, wherein said processes/long term storage often involve a combination of high temperature and/or high moisture, thereby responding to a widely sought-after and currently unmet demand for dehydrated microorganisms with improved stability. Summary of the invention The Applicant has surprisingly found that the addition of at least one hygroscopic salt layer surrounding the dehydrated microorganisms enhances the survival rate (i.e. viability) of these dehydrated microorganisms, especially in high humidity and/or high temperature conditions. Indeed, whereas the skilled man typically uses hydrophobic (e.g. fats), low permeability compounds (e.g. shellac or HPMC) or non-hygroscopic salt(s) as coatings in order to prevent moisture uptake, the Applicant surprisingly has found that at least one coating comprising hygroscopic salt(s) enables processing and storage of dehydrated microorganisms in conditions involving high humidity and/or high temperature without altering microorganisms viability. The invention thus particularly relates to a coated dehydrated microorganism comprising a dehydrated microorganism surrounded by at least one coating, said coating comprising by dry weight at least 25% of hygroscopic salt or mixture thereof as hereafter defined, and wherein the pH of the coating is compatible with viability of the coated dehydrated microorganism, as defined in the claims. The "at least one coating" of the present invention is therefore an "at least one hygroscopic salt coating". The coating can also comprise by dry weight 0 to 60% of at least one non hygroscopic salt. Optionally, other ingredients can be included into the coating, such as polyhydroxy compounds, anti-sticking agents, compounds having health and/or nutritional benefits (anti-oxidants, vitamins, minerals, prebiotics, peptides, proteins,...), hydrocolloids, fillers, lubricants, binders, acids, alkali, hydrophobic species, polymers, and mixtures thereof. These other optional ingredients are preferably in a quantity by dry weight of 0 to 70%. The invention thus particularly relates to a coated dehydrated microorganism comprising a dehydrated microorganism surrounded by at least one coating, said coating comprising by dry weight: at least 25% of a hygroscopic salt or mixture thereof,0 to 60% of a non hygroscopic salt or mixture thereof,0 to 70% of other optional ingredient(s) and wherein the pH of the coating is compatible with viability of the coated dehydrated microorganism. One or more layers of hygroscopic salt coating according to the present invention (respectively named "1st hygroscopic salt coating", "2nd hygroscopic salt coating"...) can be used to coat the dehydrated microorganism, with the same or a different composition. The invention thus particularly relates to a coated dehydrated microorganism comprising a dehydrated microorganism surrounded by at least one coating, or at least two, or at least three or or at least four coatings as defined according to the invention. One or more outer coating layers surrounding the hygroscopic salt coating(s) (respectively named "1st outer coating layer", "2nd outer coating layer...") can also be added. These optional outer coating layers can comprise conventional compounds such as fats; fatty acids (e.g. stearic acid); emulsifiers (such as mono and di-glycerides); oils; waxes; resins; low permeability polymers (e.g. shellac, sepifilm, polyvinyl pyrolidone, poly ethylene glycol); hydrocolloids (e.g. carrageenan, alginates or gum arabic or xanthan gum or guar gum); starches which may be used as native or modified starches derived from potatoes, corn, whey, rice, potatoe, tapioca; cyclodextrines; polyols (e.g. mannitol); cellulose and cellulose derivatives (HPMC, cellulose esters, cellulose ethers) and mixtures thereof. The outer coating layers may be used to provide further resistance to the dehydrated microorganism, particularly to protect against inactivation by gastric and/or oxidative environments and/or conditions with unfavourable pH. These layers can also provide enhanced mechanical resistance, enhanced resistance to steam treatment or enhanced handling properties (e.g., improved solids flow) to the coated dehydrated microorganism. It has been shown that the coating of the invention provides enhanced resistance to inactivation during secondary processes used for the preparation of food, feed, consumer healthcare products or agri-products and/or provides long term shelf-life stability required in food, feed, consumer healthcare products and agri-products. Consequently, the coated dehydrated microorganism according to the present invention can be employed in functional foods, feed products, consumer healthcare products and agri-products. This new technology is expected to increase sales of key dehydrated microorganisms, particularly key probiotic microorganisms and direct fed microbials, as it is responding to a sought-after market demand for enabling the use of dehydrated microorganisms in new applications such as food, feed, consumer healthcare products and agri-products where current commercial freeze-dried microorganisms lack long-term and processing stability. Definitions The term "coating" used in the present invention means any layer (or coating layer) surrounding the dehydrated microorganism once the liquid coating composition is applied and dried. The quantity of ingredient(s) of the coating is expressed in percentage, which is a percentage by dry weight (wt% dry) and related to the coating layer itself (and not to the coated dehydrated microorganism). The percentages are inclusive of any bound waters of crystallization. In the present invention, the term "salt(s)" also encompasses salt hydrates. So hygroscopic salt(s) include hygroscopic salt hydrates and non hygroscopic salt(s) include non hygroscopic salt hydrates. The expression "at least 25% of hygroscopic salt(s)" is synonymous with the expression "at least 25% of a hygroscopic salt or mixture thereof". It means either: at least 25% of a single hygroscopic salt; orat least 25% of a mixture of several hygroscopic salts (for example at least 20% of a first hygroscopic salt + at least 5% of another hygroscopic salt). The same interpretation shall be made with the other preferred percentages later mentioned in the application. "Hygroscopicity is the tendency of a substance to absorb moisture from the air". Hygroscopic reads "(of a substance) tending to absorb moisture from the air" (Oxford English Dictionary). Hygroscopicity can be characterized by these two parameters: (a) the Moisture Holding Capacity (MHC) and (b) the Moisture Uptake Rate (MUR). Hygroscopicity can be defined as the relative amount of water a material can absorb. Accordingly, the Moisture Holding Capacity (MHC) is the equilibrium amount of water a material can absorb when exposed to a given relative humidity. "Relative humidity of air (RH) is the ratio of the partial pressure of water vapour to its vapour pressure at that temperature" (Atkins, Physical Chemistry, OUP, 1978, p199). In the present application, Moisture Holding Capacity (MHC) refers to the equilibrium quantity of moisture absorbed by the coating or by the coated dehydrated microorganism, on a gravimetric basis, when exposed to an environment of controlled relative humidity. It can be measured by recording the weight gain of the coating or of the coated dehydrated microorganism, until no further weight gain is observed. MHC can be expressed either volumetrically (in units of mg/cm3) or gravimetrically (in weight percent (% w/w)), on the basis of the starting material prior to being exposed to humidity. It is important to note that MHC may dependent on the amount of exposed surface area and the thickness of a material. MHC can be further analyzed according to the formula described by Sharma and Patel, "study and evaluation of hygroscopic behaviour of phosphatic fertilizers" IFA Technical Conference, 1-4 October 2000, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA: M⁢H⁢C⁢ = M⁢A/M⁢P, where: MA = moisture absorption, (mg/cm2), a measure of how much moisture is taken up into a given surface area of the material (mg/cm2); andMP = moisture penentration (cm), a measure of the depth of moisture penetration. (b) The Moisture Uptake Rate (MUR): The hygroscopicity of a salt can be measured by the MUR ("Additive to biological substances. III. The moisture content and moisture uptake of commonly used carrier agents undergoing processing conditions similar to those used in the preparation of international biological standards", E Tarelli and al., Journal of Biological Standardization, 1987, 15, 331-340).There is also a kinetic dimension to hygroscopicity. The Moisture Uptake Rate (MUR) is the MHC per unit time, measured for a given %RH, at a given temperature and for a given time period, measured in hours or days. In the present invention, a salt having a MUR of least 20% w/w at 25°C at 75% RH after 7 days will be considered as a hygroscopic salt and a salt having a MUR of less than 20% w/w at 25°C at 75% RH after 7 days will be considered as a non hygroscopic salt. A detailed protocol for MUR determination with data is given in example 9. It has to be understood that the MUR and therefore the hygroscopic or non hygroscopic nature of a salt depends upon the atmospheric conditions (especially the temperature or the % RH) under which it is measured. The definition of a hygroscopic or non hygroscopic salt provided in this application is limited to the following specific conditions: after storage of the salt at 25°C and at 75% RH for 7 days. For example in the literature sodium sulphate is sometimes cited as a hygroscopic salt and at others times as a non hygroscopic salt, depending on the ambient humidity and temperature. In the present invention, it is classified as a non hygroscopic salt because its MUR was measured at 25°C at 75% RH after 7 days and was less than 20% w/w. In other literature or patents, it could be considered as hygroscopic for example when the MUR is measured at higher %RH. So as used in the present invention, a hygroscopic salt has to be understood as an inorganic or an organic salt (salt hydrates being encompassed) with a MUR of at least 20% w/w at 25°C at 75% RH after 7 days. The degree of hygroscopicity varies considerably amongst hygroscopic salts (that is to say that some salts are very hygroscopic in comparison with some others). Preferably the hygroscopic salt according to the invention has a MUR of at least 30% w/w at 25°C at 75% RH after 7 days, more preferably a MUR of at least 40% w/w at 25°C at 75% RH after 7 days, more preferably a MUR of at least 50% w/w at 25°C at 75% RH after 7 days and even more preferably a MUR of at least 60% w/w at 25°C at 75% RH after 7 days. Some examples of hygroscopic salts according to the invention are dipotassium phosphate (K2HPO4), disodium hydrogen phosphate anhydrous (Na2HPO4), sodium hexametaphosphate (NaPO3)6, sodium acetate anhydrous (CH3COONa), magnesium nitrate (Mg(NO3)2), calcium bromide (CaBr), lithium bromide (LiBr), calcium chloride (CaCl2), magnesium chloride (MgCl2), lithium chloride (LiCl), phosphorus pentoxide (P4O10), disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4 - 2H2O), disodium hydrogen phosphate heptahydrate (Na2HPO4 - 7H2O), ammonium acetate (CH3COONH3), calcium acetate (CH3COO)2Ca, potassium acetate (CH3COOK), potassium carbonate (K2CO3), sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), sodium formate (NaCHO2), potassium citrate monohydrate (K3C6H5O7.H2O), Sodium citrate pentahydrate (C6H5Na3O7.5H2O) and mixtures thereof For example: K2HPO4 has a MUR of 45.6% w/w at 25°C at 75% RH after 7 days,K2CO3 has a MUR of 50.7% w/w at 25°C at 75% RH after 7 days,MgCl2 has a MUR of 53.7% w/w at 25°C at 75% RH after 7 days. In addition, the expression "hygroscopic salt or mixture thereof" encompasses the two following aspects: (a) the salt(s) is/are initially hygroscopic (per se), that is to say that before being applied onto the dehydrated coated micororganism, it/they has/have a MUR of at least 20% w/w at 25°C at 75% RH after 7 days; and/or:(b) one or more of the salt(s) is/are not initially hygroscopic but it/they become(s) hygroscopic once applied onto the dehydrated microorganism (i.e. once processed). In other words, before being applied onto the dehydrated, it/they has/have not a MUR of at least 20% w/w at 25°C at 75% RH after 7 days but it/they has/have a MUR of at least 20% w/w at 25°C at 75% RH after 7 days once the coating is applied onto the microorganism. By way of example, it has been surprisingly shown in sample 28 that the addition of a certain amount of NaOH to a non hygroscopic salt such as KH2PO4 provides a suitable coating containing hygroscopic salt coming from the reaction KH2PO4 with NaOH (alteration of the non-hygroscopic nature of this salt, leading to a hygroscopic one). So the hygroscopic salt(s) is(are) a hygroscopic salt per se and/or becomes a hygroscopic salt after being applied onto the dehydrated microorganisms. In addition, the material itself, the temperature, the humidity and drying conditions under which the coating is applied will influence "the degree of hydration" of the coating and thereby the hygroscopicity of the salts(s) in the coating. As used herein, a non-hygroscopic salt according to the invention is an organic or an inorganic salt (salt hydrates being encompassed) with a MUR at 25°C and 75% RH after 7 days of less than 20% w/w. Preferably a non-hygroscopic salt according to the invention has a MUR of less than 10%, more preferably of less than 5% w/w at 25°C at 75% RH after 7 days. Examples of non hygroscopic salts according to the invention are monopotassium phosphate (KH2PO4), sodium acetate tri hydrate (CH3COONa.3H2O), calcium sulphate dihydrate (CaSO3.2H2O), sodium sulphate (Na2SO4), magnesium sulphate (MgSO4), potassium sulphate (K2SO4), sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium chloride (KCl), calcium carbonate (CaCO3), calcium lactate ((CH3CHOHCOO)2Ca), calcium citrate tetrahydrate ((Ca3C6H07)2.4H2O), sodium citrate dihydrate (HOC(COONa)(CH2COONa)2.2H2O), and mixtures thereof. In the present application, a pH of the coating "compatible with viability of the coated dehydrated microorganism" means that the pH is chosen in such a way that it does not alter the microorganism viability. It varies upon strains but it should generally be between 5.5 and 7.9, preferably between 6 and 7.5. In the meaning of the present invention, this pH refers to the pH measured after the coated dehydrated microorganism of the present invention is suspended in water in an amount of 10 wt%. In the present application, "final products" refer to food products, feed products, consumer healthcare products or agri-products incorporating the coated dehydrated microorganisms of the present invention. Detailed description of the invention The inventors have surprisingly found that presence in the coating of particular salts, i.e. hygroscopic salt(s), in a sufficient amount, leads to an increase in viability of the coated dehydrated microorganism. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the inventors surmise that the microorganism stabilizing effect obtained with the coating is dependent on the ability of the coating to absorb moisture, which is directly related to the presence of hygroscopic salt(s) that readily absorb(s) moisture. In addition, when processed to coat the dehydrated microorganisms, the hygroscopic salt layer comprising such hygroscopic salt(s) may take the form of an amorphous or partially amorphous (semi-crystalline) state, which allows for enhanced diffusion of moisture and/or a higher amount of moisture absorption into the coating bulk phase. The inventors have shown that when the coating is amorphous or not fully crystalline once processed (i.e. applied onto the dehydrated microorganisms), its capacity to absorb moisture and/or its rate of moisture absorption is/are significantly greater and surprisingly the viability is enhanced compared to coatings showing low hygroscopicity. The invention thus particularly relates to a coated dehydrated microorganism comprising a dehydrated microorganism surrounded by at least one coating, said coating comprising by dry weight at least 25% of hygroscopic salt or mixture thereof, and wherein the pH of the coating is compatible with viability of the coated dehydrated microorganism, as defined in the claims. The invention is also about a coated dehydrated microorganism consisting of a dehydrated microorganism surrounded by at least one coating, said coating comprising by dry weight at least 25% of hygroscopic salt or mixture thereof, and wherein the pH of the coating is compatible with viability of the coated dehydrated microorganism. The coating contains preferably at least 28% by dry weight of a hygroscopic salt or mixture of hygroscopic salts, more preferably at least 30%, more preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, more preferably at least 60%, more preferably at least 70%, more preferably at least 80%, of a hygroscopic salt or mixture of hygroscopic salts. In a specific embodiment the coating consists of 100% by dry weight of a hygroscopic salt or mixture of hygroscopic salts. In one embodiment, the hygroscopic salt(s) of the coating according to the invention is(are) selected from the group comprising or consisting of dipotassium phosphate (K2HPO4), disodium hydrogen phosphate anhydrous (Na2HPO4), sodium hexametaphosphate (NaPO3)6, sodium acetate anhydrous (CH3COONa), magnesium nitrate (Mg(NO3)2), calcium bromide (CaBr), lithium bromide (LiBr), calcium chloride (CaCl2), magnesium chloride (MgCl2), lithium chloride (LiCl), phosphorus pentoxide (P4O10), disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4 - 2H2O), disodium hydrogen phosphate heptahydrate (Na2HPO4 - 7H2O), ammonium acetate (CH3COONH3), calcium acetate (CH3COO)2Ca, potassium acetate (CH3COOK), potassium carbonate (K2CO3), sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), sodium formate (NaCHO2), potassium citrate monohydrate (K3C6H5O7.H2O), Sodium citrate pentahydrate (C6H5Na3O7.5H2O) and mixture thereof. Magnesium chloride (MgCl2) and dipotassium phosphate (K2HPO4) are the preferred hygroscopic salts, dipotassium phosphate (K2HPO4) being the most preferred one. Therefore in a particular embodiment, the dehydrated microorganism is surrounded by at least one coating, said coating comprising K2HPO4 as hygroscopic salt or comprising a mixture of hygroscopic salts including K2HPO4. In a particular embodiment, the dehydrated microorganism is surrounded by at least one coating comprising MgCl2. In a particular embodiment, the dehydrated microorganism is surrounded by at least one coating consisting of MgCl2 (sample 25 of table 1). In a particular embodiment, the coating comprises a mixture of at least two hygroscopic salts. It is important that the pH of the coating is compatible with viability of the coated dehydrated microorganism. Suitable pH for coating the dehydrated microorganism according to the present invention can be obtained by several means.. The pH of the coating can be readily compatible with microorganism viability, depending on the nature of the compounds chosen to prepare the coating according to the invention. For example the preparation of a coating consisting of a neutral hygroscopic salt allows getting a suitable pH. In that case there is no need to adjust the pH of the coating. A compatible pH can be obtained by adequately combining compounds of the coating, as some materials are more acid than others. Alternatively, the pH can be modulated by the addition of standard alkali (e.g.NaOH, KOH) or acids (e.g. lactic acid) to the coating solution. By way of example, one who is intended to prepare a coating comprising K2HPO4 as hygroscopic salt can add an acid such as lactic acid, to reduce the pH of the resulting coating, as K2HPO4 is a slightly basic salt. He can also prepare a mixture adding a certain amount of KH2PO4 to K2HPO4 to reduce the pH of the resulting coating, (because of the acidic nature of KH2PO4). Therefore in a particular embodiment, the dehydrated microorganisms are surrounded by at least one coating comprising at least K2HPO4 and at least an acid. In another particular embodiment the coating comprises at least K2HPO4 and KH2PO4. A pH compatible with the viability of the coated dehydrated microorganism varies upon strains but it should generally be between 5.5 to 7.9, preferably between 6 to 7.5. In view of its composition, the coating of the present invention has a pH value which is suitable for enhancing the microorganism viability during application of the coating onto the dehydrated micororganisms, during storage of the coated dehydrated microorganisms in dry conditions, during incorporation and storage of the coated dehydrated microorganisms in finished products and following rehydration of the microorganisms. Typically, the coated dehydrated microorganism according to the invention provides a solution/suspension having a pH of from 5.5 to 7.9, preferably from 6 to 7.5, when redisolved/resuspended in water in an amount of 10 wt%. The coating can also comprise by dry weight 0 to 60% of a non hygroscopic salt or mixture thereof. In a particular embodiment the coating contains from 5% to 60%, preferably from 10% to 60%, preferably from 15% to 50%, and more preferably from 20 to 35% of a non hygroscopic salt or mixture thereof. In a particular embodiment the coating contains less than 50%, or less than 40%, or less than 30%, or less than 20%, or less than 10% or less than 5% of a non hygroscopic salt or mixture thereof. In one embodiment, the non-hygroscopic salt(s) of the coating according to the invention is(are) selected from the group comprising or consisting of monopotassium phosphate (KH2PO4), sodium acetate tri hydrate (CH3COONa.3H2O), calcium sulphate dihydrate (CaSO3.2H2O), sodium sulphate (Na2SO4), magnesium sulphate (MgSO4), potassium sulphate (K2SO4), sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium chloride (KCl), calcium carbonate (CaCO3), calcium lactate ((CH3CHOHCOO)2Ca), calcium citrate tetrahydrate ((Ca3C6H507)2.4H2O), sodium citrate dihydrate (HOC(COONa)(CH2COONa)2.2H2O), and mixtures thereof, monopotassium phosphate (KH2PO4) being the most preferred non-hygroscopic salt(s). In one embodiment the coating comprises monopotassium phosphate (KH2PO4). In a particular embodiment, the coating according to the invention comprises a mixture of at least one hygroscopic salt with at least one non hygroscopic salt. In a particular embodiment, the dehydrated microorganism is surrounded by at least one coating comprising dipotassium phosphate (K2HPO4) and monopotassium phosphate (KH2PO4). In a specific embodiment, the dehydrated microorganism is surrounded by at least one coating consisting of dipotassium phosphate (K2HPO4) and monopotassium phosphate (KH2PO4). In a particular embodiment, the coating comprises dipotassium phosphate (K2HPO4) and sodium acetate tri hydrate (CH3COONa.3H2O). Their ratio can be from 1: 99 to 99:1. They can be present under an equimolar ratio. Optionally other ingredients can be included into the coating, such as polyhydroxy compounds, anti-sticking agents, compounds having health and/or nutritional beneficits (anti-oxidants, vitamins, minerals, prebiotics, peptides, proteins...), hydrocolloids, fillers, lubricants, binders, acids, alkali, hydrophobic species, polymers, and mixtures thereof. These other optional ingredients are preferably in a quantity by dry weight of 0 to 70%, more preferably from 10% to 60%, even more preferably from 17 to 40%. These optional ingredients can be used to improve processability of the coating (i.e. applied onto the dehydrated microorganism). For example talc or starches (whey starch, rice starch) are inert ingredients that could be used as anti-sticking agent of the coating. These optional ingredients can also be used to bring an additional benefit/effect into the final product (e.g. vitamin supplementation). They can also be used to adjust the pH of the coating to a value that is "compatible with the viability of the coated dehydrated microorganism".

According to a typical embodiment, the coating comprises or consists of K2HPO4 (hygroscopic salt) or a mixture of salts comprising K2HPO4. and optional ingredient(s) (talc, rice starch and/or sucrose...). A preferred coating is K2HPO4 (60-90 wt% dry) and talc (10-40 wt% dry). A particular preferred coating of the invention is K2HPO4 (83 wt% dry) and talc (17 wt% dry) (see sample 27 of table 1). Another particular preferred coating of the invention can be obtained by mixing KH2PO4 (non hygroscopic salt) with NaOH (optional ingredient). The addition of NaOH allows adjustment of the pH of the coating to pH 6.5 and it also reacts with KH2PO4 to surprisingly provide a suitable hygroscopic coating. Without being bound to any theory, the inventors believe that the equilibrium of the salt in solution is changed by addition of NaOH and that the non-hygroscopic character of KH2PO4 is altered once applied onto the dehydrated microorganism. For example a particular coating is KH2PO4 (83 wt % dry) and talc (17 wt % dry) (see sample 28 of table 1). The three pKa values for phosphoric acid are 2.16, 7.21 and 12.32. Therefore, for a pH lower than 2.16, phosphate will be present in an aqueous solution mainly as the H3PO4 form. For a pH between 2.16 and 7.21, phosphate will be present in an aqueous solution mainly as the H2PO4- form. For a pH between 7.21 and 12.32, phosphate will be present in an aqueous solution mainly as the HPO4-- form. Above pH 12.32, phosphate will be present in an aqueous solution mainly as the PO4--- form. Regarding the sample 28 (KH2PO4), phosphate will be present in solution mainly as the H2PO4- form. Before pH adjustment with the base, this salt solution has a pH of 5 (see pH value of sample 16, Table 20). When a base is added to K2HPO4, the equilibrium is shifted from H2PO4- form towards the formation of the HPO4- form. * Therefore, modifying the pH of a salt by the addition of a base (or an acid) can change significantly the phosphate form in solution. Therefore, modifying the pH of a salt by the addition of a base (or an acid) can change also significantly the hygroscopicity of the salt upon processing as a result of the change in phosphate form in solution. Indeed, we know that K2HPO4 (mostly HPO4- form in solution) is a hygroscopic salt in the dried state whereas KH2PO4 (mostly H2PO4- form in solution) is non hygroscopic salt in the dry state. (Indeed, the pH adjustment done on the sample 28 leads to an increase in the HPO4- form which is then resulting in a hygroscopic salt coating after processing. By adjusting the pH of a salt solution, it is then possible to obtain a hygroscopic salt in the coating after processing even if the salt used in the liquid coating composition was initially not hygroscopic. According to a typical embodiment, the coating comprises or consists of K2HPO4 (hygroscopic salt) and a non hygroscopic salt (sodium acetate tri hydrate, KH2PO4...) and at least one optional ingredient (talc, starch, sucrose...) A particular preferred coating of the invention is K2HPO4 (30 wt % dry), sodium acetate tri hydrate (30 wt% dry), sucrose (17 wt % dry) and talc (14 wt % dry) (see sample 26 of table 1). Another preferred coating is K2HPO4 (25-65 wt% dry), KH2PO4 (15-50 wt% dry), talc (10-30 wt% dry). A particular preferred coating of the invention is K2HPO4 (48 wt% dry), KH2PO4 (35 wt% dry), talc (17 wt% dry) (see sample 10 of table 1). Another particular preferred coating consists of K2HPO4 (63 wt% dry), KH2PO4 (20 wt% dry), and talc (17 wt% dry) (see sample 22 of table 1). Another particular coating consists of an equi-molar quantity of KH2PO4 and K2HPO4 with talc. According to another typical embodiment, the coated dehydrated microorganism comprises a dehydrated microorganism surrounded by at least one coating comprising or consisting of K2HPO4 (hygroscopic salt) and KH2PO4 (non hygroscopic salt), and several optional ingredients (for example sucrose and either talc or starch). A preferred coating is K2HPO4 (25-50 wt% dry), KH2PO4 (20-40 wt% dry), sucrose (10-30 wt% dry) and talc (10-30 wt% dry), more preferably a coating of K2HPO4 (30-45 wt% dry), KH2PO4 (25-35 wt% dry), sucrose (15-25 wt% dry) and talc (10-20 wt% dry). A particular preferred coating of the invention is K2HPO4 (40 wt% dry), KH2PO4 (29 wt% dry), sucrose (17 wt% dry) and talc (14 wt% dry) (see sample 11 of table 1). The inventors surmise that a high MHC or a high MUR of a coating is a result of the physical properties of the hygroscopic salt(s) contained within the coating and of the structure of the coating. Indeed the hygroscopic salt(s) is/are capable of absorbing or retaining moisture within the coated layer without altering microorganism viability, which is surprising. When the inventors had prepared coated dehydrated microorganisms comprising a dehydrated microorganism surrounded by at least one coating comprising the hygroscopic salt(s), they found that this coating layer comprising such hygroscopic salt(s) leads to an amorphous or partially amorphous (semi-crystalline) state, particularly when using techniques leading to rapid deshydratation of the coating (spray-drying or fluid-bed coating). Moisture absorption will depend on the amount and the behaviour of the hygroscopic salt(s) and on the structure of the final coating. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the inventors hypothesize that this amorphous or partially amorphous state could explain in part the enhanced microorganism viability. Indeed the inventors have shown that when the coating is not fully crystalline once processed to obtain a dry coating ("once processed" means once applied onto the dehydrated microorganism), its capacity to absorb moisture is significantly greater and surprisingly the viability is enhanced compared to coatings which are non hygroscopic. the benefit conferred by the coating in the dried state relates to the amount of moisture the solid coating can absorb, and this amount is greater for amorphous (non-crystalline) or for partially amorphous (semi-crystalline) coatings. Amorphous or partially amorphous (semi-crystalline) state allows for enhanced moisture absorption into the coating bulk phase. Presence of amorphous structure in the coating induces higher MUR and continual increase in the percentage of moisture uptake. Relatively low percentage of amorphous material can absorb considerable amount of moisture into their structure (Encyclopedia of Pharma tech, Vol 6). Both MUR and MHC will depend on the amount and the behaviour of the hygrospic salts, as well as on the structure of the final coating. The inventors have shown that when the coating is amorphous or not fully crystalline once processed (i.e. applied onto the dehydrated microorganism), its capacity to absorb moisture is significantly greater and surprisingly the viability is enhanced compared to coatings which are non hygroscopic: the benefit conferred by the coating in the dried state relates to the amount of moisture the solid coating can absorb, and this amount is greater for amorphous (non-crystalline) or partially amorphous (semi-crystalline) coatings. According to the invention a "crystalline state" means that the state is characterized by a perfectly ordered lattice in which there is long-range atomic order, while a "non-crystalline" (or "amorphous") state is characterized by a disordered lattice in which there is no long-range order of the positions of the atoms. These represent two extremes of lattice order and intermediate states are possible. In principle, given a sufficiently high drying rate, any liquid composition can be made into an amorphous solid. Drying reduces molecular mobility. If the drying rate is faster than the rate at which molecules can organize into a more thermodynamically favorable crystalline state, then an amorphous solid will be formed. In contrast, if molecules have sufficient time to organize into a structure with two- or three-dimensional order, then a crystalline (or semi-crystalline) solid will be formed. Amorphous materials can also be produced by additives which interfere with the ability of the primary constituent to crystallize. When hygroscopic salt(s) is/are processed either alone/together or in a blend with at least one non hygroscopic salt and/or at least one optional other ingredient, using a technique allowing for rapid dehydration such as fluid-bed coating, it results in a disordered solid of low crystallinity. This state of "low crystallinity" has a beneficial effect in the dried state. Indeed, the benefit conferred in the dried state relates to the amount of moisture the solid can absorb; this amount is greater for coatings presenting amorphous structure. To prepare the dehydrated coated microorganisms according to the invention, processes used to obtain dried solids leading to partially or fully amorphous coatings are therefore preferred. For example, fluid-bed-coating is one of the most preferred techniques to prepare the coated dehydrated microoganisms as it leads to rapid deshydratation and it can result in an amorphous structure. In one embodiment, said the salt (s) present in the coating (hygroscopic salt(s) and non hygroscopic salt (s)) has/have a salt crystallinity degree (grams of salt(s) under the crystalline form divided by the grams of coating) of up to 60% once the coating is processed (i.e. once the coating is applied onto the dehydrated microorganism), preferably up to 50%, more preferably up to 40% and even more preferably up to 30%. The crystallinity degree of the salt(s) present in the coating was determined on the coating once processed, that is to say after the liquid coating composition is applied onto the dehydrated microorganism and dried. According to the invention, the expression "crystallinity degree" means the fractional amount of salt(s) of the coating, expressed as a percentage by mass that is generally present in a crystalline state, the remainder of the salts of the coating being present in an amorphous state. The degree of crystallinity can be measured by various techniques known to one skilled in the art, such as i) X-ray diffraction (see Encyclopaedia of Pharmaceutical Technology, 2002) or ii) isothermal Differential Scanning Calorimetry (isothermal DSC) (Kedward, MacNaughtanm Blanchard and Mitchell, 1998). When using X-ray diffraction (XRD), the X-ray diffraction pattern of every crystalline form of a compound is unique, the technique is widely used for the identification and characterization of solid phases. The technique can also reveal differences in the crystallinity of compounds. The XRD pattern of an amorphous (non-crystalline) compound will consist of one or more broad diffuse halos (Encyclopaedia of Pharmaceutical Technology, 2002, page 3005). The degree of crystallinity according to the invention can also be measured using a DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry). For examplea Netzch DSC 204 (Netzsch, Germany) equipped with an intracooler was used for all measurements with N2 as flushing agent according to TEST A. Test A consists of the following protocol: Samples of 10 mg of the coating were weighed and immediately hermetically sealed into into aluminium DSC pans. The scan was run by first cooling and holding each sample at an initial temperature of -50°C for 2 minutes. The samples were then heated from -50°C to 330°C at 12°C min-1 and held at 330°C for 3 minutes. This test was used in exemple 11 to characterize the amorphous state of the coating obtained by fluid-bed drying. The test was carried out on the coating itself produced under the same process conditions as those used to coat the dehydrated microorganisms, as described in exemple 11. Hence, the thermograms shown in figures 10 to 12 are characteristic of the structure of the coating of the present invention. The degree of crystallinity of the salt(s) of the coating is independent of the presence of the underlaying dehydrated microorganisms since each consists of a separate layer. The degree of crystallinity can also be measured using other suitable techniques such as TMA (Thermal Mechanical Analysis) that will measure the response of coating to changes in temperature and a glass transition temperature characteristic of an amorphous structure can be determined. The technique uses probes that are placed into the coating. According to the present invention, the coating has a Moisture Uptake Rate (MUR) of at least 20% w/w, preferably at least 30% w/w, at 25°C and at 75% relative humidity (RH) after 7 days. According to a particular embodiment, the coated dehydrated microorganism has a Moisture Uptake Rate of at least 8% w/w, at 25°C and at 75% relative humidity (RH) after 7 days. Water sorption isotherms were conducted to characterize the hygroscopicity of the coated dehydrated microorganism. The coated dehydrated microorganism (or the coating of the invention) exhibited a strong change in its water content as a function of relative humidity, thereby indicating a highly hygroscopic behaviour. In addition, the profile showed a continuous increase in water content, which is characteristic of an amorphous or partially amorphous structure. Moreover, as already mentioned, it is advantageous to process the coating in such a way as to ensure a rapid rate of drying (eg. by fluid-bed coating) as this prevents the creation of an ordered structure, leading to the formation of a solid solution. The low crystalline structure is therefore the result of a phase transition during the process and does not reflect the initial solid state of each individual salt. A partially crystalline coating containing at least 25% of a hygroscopic salt or mixture thereof, has a significantly greater capacity to absorb moisture. Surprisingly, the viability of the dehydrated microorganism is enhanced by this enhanced moisture absorbing capacity, provided that there is a pH compatible with viability of the coated dehydrated microorganism. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the inventors think that this phenomenon could be partially linked to the fact that the coating is not fully crystalline once processed, especially when rapid rate drying techniques are used. In a particular embodiment, the coated dehydrated microorganism according to the invention has a stability after it is manufatured, during storage in dry conditions, and before end-use of minimum 40% survival, preferably at least 50% survival, preferably at least 60% survival, preferably at least 70% survival, preferably at least 80% survival and preferably 90% survival upon storage from 15°C to 40°C for up to 2 years when stored in sealed conditions. A high viable bacteria survival rate is obtained in the intended applications after several months of storage of final products (e.g. in food products, feed products, consumer healthcare products or agri-products) comprising the coated dehydrated microorganisms according to the invention (e.g. after 1 month of storage, even after 2 months, even after 3 months, even after 5 months, even after 9 months, even after 12 months, even after 2 years, even longer...), especially when stored at ambient temperatures (e.g. from 15°C to 40°C, especially from 20-35°C, for example at 23°C or 30°C), and especially when the water activity (aw) of the final product is greater than 0.10. The coating of the present invention is therefore a stabilizing coating for dehydrated microorganisms. In a particular embodiment, the coated dehydrated microorganism according to the invention is capable to have a viability loss of < 1.5 LOG, most preferably of < 1.0 LOG, most preferably of < 0.5 LOG, most preferably of < 0.2 LOG, and most preferably of < 0.1 LOG upon 12 months storage at temperature from 15°C to 40°C, in a feed product, a food product, a consumer healthcare product or an agri-product having an aw greater than 0.10. The viability loss is the reduction of the number of viable cells as measured by cfu (colony forming unit) before and after any exposure. It is generally expressed in LOG. According to the invention, the term LOG or E or E is intended to mean decimal logarithm, i.e., a multiplicative factor of ten. In another particular embodiment, the coated dehydrated microorganism according to the invention is capable to have viability loss of < 3 LOG, most preferably of < 1.5 LOG, most preferably of < 1.0 LOG, most preferably of < 0.5 LOG, and most preferably of < 0.2 LOG upon 2 years storage at temperature from 15°C to 40°C, in a feed product, a food product, a consumer healthcare product or an agri-product having an aw greater than 0.10. The coating according to the invention is a stabilizing coating which surrounds and protects dehydrated microorganisms against moisture and/or heat. The technology can be used for sensitive dehydrated microorganisms. By "sensitive" it is meant having a low viability when exposed to high humidity and/or high temperature. These coated dehydrated living microorganisms will have an increased survival rate in stressfull conditions as well as an extended shelflife (e.g. of at least 1 month, or of at least 2 months, or of at least 5 months or of at least 12 months or of at least 2 years or even longer, especially when stored at ambient temperatures, e.g. from 15°C to 40°C, especially from 20-35°C, for example at 23°C or 30°C, and especially when aw in the final product is greater than 0.10). In addition, if conventional outercoating(s) (such as fats; fatty acids (e.g. stearic acid); emulsifiers (such as mono and di-glycerides); oils; waxes; resins; low permeability polymers (e.g. shellac, sepifilm, polyvinyl pyrolidone, poly ethylene glycol); hydrocolloids (e.g. carrageenans, alginates or gum arabic or xanthan gum or guar gum); starches which may be used as native or modified starches derived from potatoes, corn, whey, rice, potatoe, tapioca; cyclodextrines; polyols (e.g. mannitol); cellulose and cellulose derivatives (HPMC, cellulose esters, cellulose ethers), and mixtures thereof) is/are added, the coated dehydrated microorganism, especially coated sensitive dehydrated microorganism, will be more resistant to unfavorable pH for an enhanced survival into the gastrointestinal tract and/or to oxidative environments and/or to processes including steam-treatment, and it will retain most of its activity. Another advantage provided by the present invention is that the coated dehydrated microorganisms that are obtained do not stick together under ambient conditions despite the use of hygroscopic salt(s). Free-flowing particulates of dehydrated microorganisms with enhanced viability are therefore obtained. The dehydrated microorganism of the invention is typically selected from the group comprising yeasts, molds, fungi, bacteria or any mixture thereof. One or several kinds of microorganisms can be coated. Examples of suitable yeasts are: Kluyveromyces spp, Debaryomyces spp, Yarrowia spp, Pichia spp, Williopsis spp, Saccharomyces spp. Examples of suitable fungi/molds are: Penicillium spp, Geotrichum spp, Lecanicillium spp, Trichothecium spp. Examples of suitable bacteria are: coryneform bacteria such as for example Arthrobacter spp, Corynebacterium spp, Brevibacterium spp, or lactic acid bacteria. The dehydrated microorganism is preferably a lactic acid bacteria. According to the invention, the term "lactic acid bacteria" includes any bacteria capable of producing, as the major metabolic end product of carbohydrate fermentation, lactic acid or at least one of its derivatives (including, but not limited to, propionic acid). The term is therefore intended to include propionic acid bacteria (PAB), which produce propionic acid as a carbohydrate fermentation product. Preferably the bacteria for use in the present invention are lactic acid bacteria which are generally recognised as safe for animal or human consumption (i.e. GRAS approved). Suitable lactic acid bacteria may be selected from the genus Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Bifidobacterium, Carnobacterium, Enterococcus, Propionibacterium, Pediococcus, Streptococcus and mixtures thereof. Typically, the microorganisms are probiotics or DFM (Direct Fed Microbials). According to the invention "probiotics" or "DFMs" means live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host, the host being a human in the case of probiotics and an animal in the case of DFMs. The probiotic microorganisms or DFMs most commonly used are principally bacteria and yeasts of the following genera: Lactobacillus spp., Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., Bifidobacterium spp. and Saccharomyces spp. In a typical embodiment, the coated dehydrated microorganism according to the invention is selected from the group of Lactobacillus. Typically, the microorganisms used are L. acidophilus or L. plantarum, and more preferably L. acidophilus NCFM commercially used by the Applicant under the name L. acidophilus NCFM® or L. plantarum Lp115 having been deposited according to the Budapest Treaty on February 9, 2009 in the name of Danisco Deutschland GmbH, Busch-Johannsen-Str.1 25899, Niebüll, Germany, at the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen located at Inhoffenstr. 7 B, D-38124 Braunscheiwg, Germany under n° DSM22266. The coated dehydrated microorganism can contain from 104 to 1014 cfu/g, preferably from 107 to 1011 cfu/g by weight of the coated dehydrated microorganism. Typically, the dehydrated microorganisms can be obtained by conventionally used methods, such as "freeze-drying" or by "spray-coating of the microorganisms onto an inert core". Preparation of the dehydrated microorganism can be but is not limited to freeze-drying and spray-coating microorganisms onto an inert core. Other possible methods are 1) absorption of microorganisms or oil-suspended microorganisms on a porous inert carrier, 2) spray-drying of microorganisms, optionally followed by agglomeration, spray-granulation and high shear granulation of the microorganisms, and 3) any other methods known to the skilled man in the art and which provide a dehydrated microorganism in a form suitable for further coating. According to a typical embodiment, the liquid coating composition is spray-coated onto the dehydrated microorganism in order to get the coated dehydrated microorganism of the invention. A preferred embodiment of the invention is therefore a dehydrated microorganism, which is spray-coated with a liquid composition so as to obtain a coated dehydrated microorganism comprising a dehydrated microorganism surrounded by at least one coating, said coating comprising by dry weight at least 25% of hygroscopic salt or mixture thereof and wherein the pH of the coating is compatible with viability of the coated dehydrated microorganism. Typically, any method allowing a rapid rate of drying of the liquid coating composition may be used to spray-coat the coating onto the microorganisms, in order to obtain the formation of a non-crystalline or partially crystalline coating. Preferably, the coating is done in a fluid-bed type coating apparatus. In a typical embodiment, the coated dehydrated microorganism which has already been coated with at least one layer of coating according to the invention (also referred to as 1st coating), may be subsequently coated with at least one further coating (also referred to as outercoating(s)) comprising for example any conventional coating components such as fats; fatty acids (e.g. stearic acid); emulsifiers (such as mono and di-glycerides); oils; waxes; resins; low permeability polymers (e.g. shellac, sepifilm, polyvinyl pyrolidone, poly ethylene glycol); hydrocolloids (e.g. carrageenans, alginates or gum arabic or xanthan gum or guar gum); starches which may be used as native or modified starches derived from potatoes, corn, whey, rice, potatoe, tapioca; cyclodextrines; polyols (e.g. mannitol); cellulose and cellulose derivatives (HPMC, cellulose esters, cellulose ethers), and mixtures thereof. The outercoating(s) allow(s), in addition to an increased resistance to high temperature and/or high humidity levels provided by the coating according to the invention (1st coating), to get an increased resistance of the dehydrated microorganisms to gastric and/or oxidative environments and/or conditions with unfavourable pH, especially when the coated dehydrated microorganisms are particularly sensitive. It has also the advantage to help these dehydrated microorganisms to resist to processes using steam-treatment, as it is the case in most of the processes to prepare for exemple feed products or recombined cheese. Typically, the coating according to the invention is in a quantity of at least 10% by weight of the coated dehydrated microorganism, preferably at least 20%, more preferably at least 30%, more preferably at least 50% and even more preferably at least 70%, even more preferably at least 80%, even more preferably at least 90% by weight of the coated dehydrated microorganism. In a particular embodiment the coated dehydrated microorganism comprising a dehydrated microorganism surrounded by several layers of coating according to the invention that may comprise different compositions. Outercoating(s)) comprising for example any conventional coating components can be then added. Also disclosed is a liquid coating composition comprising at least 25% of a hygroscopic salt or mixture thereof by weight of dry solids contained in the coating composition. By liquid coating composition, it has to be understood that the liquid mixture of component(s) prepared before it is applied onto the dehydrated microorganism and dried. All of the preferred embodiments which have been previously described, such as for example, in relation to the types of components, the range of pH, also apply to the liquid coating composition. Another object of the present invention is a method for coating a dehydrated microorganism, said method comprising the steps of: (a) preparing a liquid coating composition(b) coating a dehydrated microorganism with the liquid coating composition obtained after step (a), preferably by spray-coating to obtain a coated dehydrated microorganism. The liquid coating composition comprises a hygroscopic salt or mixture thereof as defined in the claims. The process allows obtaining a coated dehydrated microorganism according to the invention, i.e. comprising a dehydrated microorganism surrounded by at least one coating comprising by dry weight at least 25% of hygroscopic salt or mixture thereof and wherein the pH of the coating is compatible with viability of the coated dehydrated microorganism. The hygroscopic salt(s) is/are preferably dissolved into an aqueous medium. 0 to 60% by dry weight of a non hygroscopic salt or mixture thereof, and/or 0 to 70% by dry weight of other optional ingredient(s) can also be ingredients of the liquid coating composition. They can be added either dissolved or suspended into to the liquid coating composition. All of the preferred embodiments which have been previously described, such as for example, in relation to the types of components contained within the coating, the nature of the coating (e.g. degree of crystallinity, MUR...) and/or the microorganisms, also apply to the method for coating a dehydrated microorganism. According to a preferred embodiment, step (b) must be performed at a temperature suitable to ensure rapid drying thereby preventing crystallization of the salts(s) of the coating surrounded the dehydrated microorganism, while preserving the viability of the coated microorganism. The temperature and duration of processing are chosen to ensure the amorphous or partially crystalline nature of the coating according to the invention, resulting from phase transition during the process. Steps (a) and (b) can be repeated several times, to provide a coated dehydrated microorganism coated by several layers. The composition of these different layers can be the same or different. The method for coating a dehydrated microorganism can further comprise a step (c): (c) coating the coated dehydrated microorganism obtained after step (b) with at least one outercoating. This at least outercoating is preferably made using conventional compounds such as fats; fatty acids (e.g. stearic acid); emulsifiers (such as mono and di-glycerides); oils; waxes; resins; low permeability polymers (e.g. shellac, sepifilm, polyvinyl pyrolidone, poly ethylene glycol); hydrocolloids (e.g. carrageenans, alginates or gum arabic or xanthan gum or guar gum); starches which may be used as native or modified starches derived from potatoes, corn, whey, rice, potatoe, tapioca; cyclodextrines; polyols (e.g. mannitol); cellulose and cellulose derivatives (HPMC, cellulose esters, cellulose ethers), and mixtures thereof. The liquid coating composition of the invention will be applied onto the dehydrated microorganism, i.e. in a separate coating layer. The coated dehydrated microorganism can be prepared by two preferred methods which have shown significant improvement in stability over commercial freeze-dried microorganims powders: 1) Liquid Route (i.e. includes the application of liquid culture of microorganisms by fluid-bed drying onto an inert core, see Figure 1A), or2) Solid Route (i.e. includes the preparation of a dried culture, see Figure 1B). General description of the "liquid route" method One method to produce the highly stable dehydrated microorganisms of the present invention with increased survival rate in stressful conditions and extended shelf-life is the "liquid-route" method. This method involves preparing a primary particle by spray-coating an inert carrier particle (i.e an inert core) with a liquid preparation of microorganisms. The primary particle is therefore composed of an inert core coated by at least one thin layer of dehydrated living microorganisms. The primary particle is then further coated with a coating according to the present invention. In this case, where the liquid culture of microorganisms is sprayed onto an inert core, it is necessary to control both the formulation of the microorganism-containing layer and the process conditions, in order to maximise the microorganism survival. In terms of the microorganism-containing layer, both the composition of the formulation and the pH of the formulation need to be optimized. A preferred method to prepare both the primary and the coated particle is through fluid-bed coating. In this approach, the primary particle is prepared by fluidizing the inert core material on an air stream and spraying the liquid culture of microorganisms onto the core material. Process conditions are chosen so as to ensure: i) maximized physical yields (i.e. ratio between the material recovered at the end of the process to the material added during the process), ii) maintenance of the viability of the microorganism, iii) minimized residual moisture in the microorganism-containing layer. The primary particle is then further spray-coated with a liquid coating composition according to the invention. The liquid coating composition is prepared by ensuring that the requisite amounts of the desired components and the optional components are either fully dissolved in an aqueous medium (eg. distilled water) or suspended in the liquid coating composition. This liquid coating composition is then sprayed onto the primary particles which are fluidized by an air stream. Process conditions are chosen so as to ensure: i) production of a coating in a partially crystalline state, ii) maximized physical yields (i.e. ratio between the material recovered at the end of the process to the material added during the process), iii) minimal rewetting of the dried living microorganism-containing layer, iv) rapid drying of the coating solution on the particle surface, v) formation of a multi-layer coating structure which is uniformly distributed over the surface of the primary particle (see example 1). General description of "solid route" method Another method for producing the highly stable dried composition containing coated living dehydrated microorganisms of the present invention with increased survival in stressful conditions and extended shelflife is the "solid route" method. In this method, the liquid coating composition of the invention is directly spray-coated onto dried dehydrated microorganism in a fluid-bed process. The dried dehydrated microorganisms may be a freeze-dried powder. Other possible methods used to obtain the dried dehydrated microorganism are α) absorption of microorganisms or oil-suspended microorganisms on a porous inert carrier, β) spray-drying of microorganisms, optionally followed by agglomeration, spray-granulation and high shear granulation of the microorganisms and δ) any other suitable methods known to the skilled man in the art. In a preferred embodiment the dried powder is a freeze-dried powder. The dried dehydrated microorganism powder can be obtained by methods previously described in prior art, such as for example in WO03/018778. Another object of the present invention is a method for protecting a dehydrated microorganism, said method comprising preparing a coated dehydrated microorganism by surrounded the dehydrated microorganism with at least one coating comprising by dry weight at least 25% of a hygroscopic salt or mixture of hygroscopic salts and wherein the pH of the coating is compatible with viability of the coated dehydrated microorganism. Another object of the present invention is the use of at least one coating comprising by dry weight at least 25% of a hygroscopic salt or a mixture thereof, wherein the pH of the coating is compatible with viability of the coated dehydrated microorganism, for protecting a dehydrated microorganism. In a particular embodiment the dehydrated microorganism is coated by several layers. The composition of these different layers can be the same or different. In another particular embodiment there is at least one outercoating, which is preferably made using conventional compounds such as fats; fatty acids (e.g. stearic acid); emulsifiers (such as mono and di-glycerides); oils; waxes; resins; low permeability polymers (e.g. shellac, sepifilm, polyvinyl pyrolidone, poly ethylene glycol); hydrocolloids (e.g. carrageenans, alginates or gum arabic or xanthan gum or guar gum); starches which may be used as native or modified starches derived from potatoes, corn, whey, rice, potatoe, tapioca; cyclodextrines; polyols (e.g. mannitol); cellulose and cellulose derivatives (HPMC, cellulose esters, cellulose ethers), and mixtures thereof.

The coating of the present invention is therefore a stabilizing coating for dehydrated microorganisms. All of the preferred embodiments which have been previously described, such as for example, in relation to the types of components contained within the coating, the nature of the coating (e.g. degree of crystallinity, MUR...) and/or the microorganisms, also apply to the method (or use) for protecting a dehydrated microorganism. Another object of the present invention is a method for the preparation of food products, feed products, consumer healthcare products or agri-products, wherein the coated dehydrated microorganism as defined in the invention or as obtained according to the method of preparation of the present invention is subsequently added to a food product, a feed product, a consumer healthcare product or an agri-product. According to the present invention "food" means products suitable for human consumption. They are materials which contain or consist of essential body nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals, and is ingested and assimilated by an organism to produce energy, stimulate growth, and maintain life, presented in the form of a solid, liquid or paste for practical consumption. These materials are often combined and mixed at high temperature and contain high humidity. The coated dehydrated microorganisms of the present invention are suitable for use in food products. They can be mixed with the food materials which can be subsequently baked, steam treated, compressed, granulated and/or molded (nutritional bars, string cheese, breakfast cereals, etc...). For steam treatment, it is preferred that the coated dehydrated microorganisms contain at least one outercoating made using conventional compounds, especially for the sensitive microorganisms. The coated dehydrated microorganism of the present invention can be used as an ingredient in the preparation of foods selected from the group comprising nutritional bars, breakfast cereals, infant formulas, biscuits cakes, cake mixes, snack foods, balanced foods and drinks, fruit fillings, cake glaze, chocolate bakery fillings, cheese cake flavoured fillings, fruit flavoured cake fillings, cake and doughnut icings, instant bakery filling creams, filings for cookies, ready-to-use bakery fillings, reduced calorie fillings, desserts, confectionery products (eg. gummi bears, candies, chocolates and chocolate chips, pralines, chewing gums, popcicles), beverages such as beverage powders, soft drinks, fruit juices, beverages comprising whey proteins, health teas, cocoa drinks, milk-based drinks, calcium fortified soy plain and chocolate milks, calcium fortified coffee beverages, lactic acid bacteria-based drinks, adult nutritional beverages, acidified soy/juice beverages, aseptic/retorted chocolate drinks, yoghurts, drinking yoghurts, cheeses, string cheeses, recombined cheeses, ice creams, sherbets. Amongst food products, nutritional bars, breakfast cereals, infant formulas and beverage powders are particularly preferred. According to the present invention "feed" means products suitable for animal consumption and can be selected from the group comprising "pet foods" (cakes, biscuits, chews, snacks... for pets), silage products and pelleted feeds. The term "animal" has to be understood under a wide meaning. It can refer to a "polygastric herbivore" which includes, but is not limited to, bovinae, cervidae, antilocapridae and camelidae. It can refer for example to a "poligastric ruminant" which includes, but is not limited to cows, sheeps, ewes, goats, dears, camels, giraffes. It can also refer to a "monogastric herbivore" such as equines and porcines as well as to domesticated animal or pets (dogs, cats, rabbits, birds, rats, mice, guinea pigs, fishes, reptils...). It can also refer to poultry, chicken, chick and also to any kind of animals from aquaculture area such as shrimps etc.... The coated dehydrated microorganism of the invention may be added to unpelletized feed mixture, which may be subsequently treated with steam and/or which are steam pelleted or dried. The unpelleted mixture refers to premixes and mashes. "Premixes" typically contain vitamin and minerals. Other ingredients such as grains and clays may also be added to premixes. "Mashes" typically contain the complete animal diet. "Pellets" are particles of spherical or cylindrical shape typically created by compressing the original feed mixture which can contain the coated dehydrated microorganisms of the invention. Before compression, the feed mixture is steamed treated in a conditioner for 30 seconds to 5 min at temperature varying from 60°C to 95°C using injected steam. As mentioned above, because of steam treatment, it is preferred that the coated dehydrated microorganisms contain at least one outercoating made using conventional compounds, especially for the sensitive microorganisms. The stream treated feed mixture is then transfered to a pellet mill or extruder and finally to a pellet cooler. The coated dehydrated microorganism of the invention may be included into gels or other oil delivery systems in order to directly supplement the animals. It can also be powders or other dry formulations for top dressing feed for example. According to the present invention, "consumer healthcare products" include dietary supplements, nutraceuticals and over-the-counter products. A consumer can be a human and/or an animal. According to the present invention a "dietary supplement" (also referred to as a food supplement or nutritional supplement), means a preparation intended to provide nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, fiber, fatty acids or amino acids, which are missing or are not consumed in sufficient quantity in a person's diet. A dietary supplement can be for human and/or animal consumption. According to the present invention, the term "nutraceutical" means a functional food which is capable of providing not only a nutritional effect and/or a taste satisfaction, but is also capable of delivering therapeutic (or other beneficial) effects to the consumer.. According to the present invention, "over-the-counter product" means non prescription medicines which can prevent certain diseases or reduce symptoms associated with gut health or immune health, thereby promoting gut health or improving the immune function. For exemple, these products allow prevention and treatment of allergies, prevention and treatment of respiratory tract infection and other emerging applications of probiotics and direct fed microbials (DFMs). According to the present invention the expression "agri-product" encompasses biopesticides, biofertilizers, products for plant care, composts and by-products as well as products of bioenergy (bio ethanol, bio ester). These products (food, feed, consumer healthcare products and agri-products) can be prepared in any kind of form such as in liquid, suspension, semi-solid, tablets, capsules, pellets, pills, powder, gels or other delivery systems, etc. In a typical embodiment, the coated dehydrated microorganisms of the present invention can be incorporated into a microperforrated straw or any other microperforrated packaging technologies or devices All of the preferred embodiments which have been previously described, such as for example, in relation to the types of components contained within the coating, the nature of the coating (e.g. degree of crystallinity, MUR...) and/or the microorganisms, also apply to the method for the preparation of food product, feed product, consumer healthcare products or agri-products. Another object of the present invention is food products, feed products, consumer healthcare products or agri-products comprising coated dehydrated microorganisms as defined or as obtained in the present invention. A high bacteria survival is obtained after several months of storage of final products comprising the coated dehydrated microorganisms according to the invention (e.g. after 1 month of storage, even after 2 months, even after 3 months, even after 5 months, even after 9 months, even after 12 months, even after 2 years, even longer ...), especially when stored at ambient temperatures (e.g. from 15 to 40°C, especially from 20°C to 35°C, for example at 23 or 30°C) and especially the aw of the final products is greater than 0.10. All of the preferred embodiments which have been previously described, such as for example, in relation to the types of components contained within the coating, the nature of the coating (e.g. degree of crystallinity, MUR...) and/or the microorganisms, also apply to the food products, feed products, consumer healthcare products and agri-products comprising said coated dehydrated microorganism. Another object of the present invention is coated dehydrated microorganism obtainable by the method of preparation of the present invention. Another object of the present invention is coated dehydrated microorganism directly obtained by the method of preparation of the present invention. All of the preferred embodiments which have been previously described, such as for example, in relation to the types of components contained within the coating, the nature of the coating (e.g. degree of crystallinity, MUR...) and/or the microorganisms, also apply to the coated dehydrated microorganism obtainable/obtained by the method of preparation of the present invention. Another object of the present invention is the use of the coated dehydrated microorganism according to the invention to produce a recombined cheese, said recombined cheese being produced by the following steps: i) grinding of the curd,ii) addition of hydrocolloids (no melting salts) to give the right texture to the final product,iii) heating to 60°C, andiv) stirring at 60°C while adding the coated dehydrated microorganisms.

The resultant coated dehydrated microorganism corresponds to sample 11. It has a final composition of: 59% inert core; 8% culture mixture; 33% coating of the invention. The other related coated dehydrated microorganism of table 1 (samples 10, 12-19, 22-28) were prepared in the same way but using different 1st coating composition formula. Some of the coated dehydrated microrganims were further coated with a conventional outercoating (to get samples 17, 18 and 19. One of the following materials was used: SEPIFILM® LP30 composed of Hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, and stearic acid from Seppic (a subsidiary of the Air Liquid Group);Shellac (MARCOAT® 125, aqueous based shellac solution (25%), from Innovative Material Technologies); Particules of samples 4 to 9 were only coated with a conventional outercoating (no hygroscopic salt coating of the invention was added).

The mixture was about 43% dry solids. 1000 g of the freeze-dried powder of L. acidophilus NCFM were charged and fluidized using a heated bed temperature of 55°C. Then, 1180 g of the liquid coating composition according to the invention was spray-coated onto the freeze-dried powder using the following process parameters: ParametersSettingProduct Air Temperature50°CInlet Air Temperature60°CFluidizing Air Flow Rate150 m3/hrSpray Temperature20°CAtomizing Air Pressure2.5 barAtomizing Air Temperature40°CSpray Rate0.70 kg/hr After the liquid coating composition has been spray coated onto the freeze-dried powder, a post-drying step is carried out until a constant humidity is achieved in the exhaust air. The resultant coated dehydrated microorganisms had a final composition of: 66% freeze-dried microorganism; 34% coating of the invention. The resultant particle corresponds to sample 20. The other related coated dehydrated microorganisms of table 1 (namely sample 21) were prepared in the same way but using a different first coating formula. It is possible to further coat the coated dehydrated microorganisms with a conventional outercoating (not done for samples 20 and 21). The same materials used in Example 1 for the outercoating could be used herein. EXAMPLE 3 - Thermostability Heat resistance of dehydrated L. acidophilus NCFM coated with a first coating prepared according to Example 1 (liquid route) was compared to dehydrated L. acidophilus NCFM coated with conventional coatings: fat (PS101/sunflower oil) or low permeability polymer (Sepifilm LP30). The control consists of uncoated dehydrated L. acidophilus NCFM cells. 1 g samples of each preparation were introduced into separate sealed hermetic sachets and kept in a water bath at 50°C. The sealed hermetic sachet from each preparation was then withdrawn from the water bath after 24 hours and the concentration of viable bacteria was immediately determined after appropriate dilution by standard plating method (Table 2).

Moreover, as illustrated in Table 3 below, it can be observed that the coatings K2HPO4 (48% dry), KH2PO4 (35% dry), talc (17% dry) and sucrose (0% dry) (sample 10) and K2HPO4 (40% dry), KH2PO4 (29% dry), talc (14% dry) and sucrose (17% dry) (sample 11) are more efficient in protecting the bacteria L. acidophilus NCFM from heat. Indeed, the thermostability of these two samples is much greater than: the thermostability of coated dehydrated microorganism comprising dehydrated microorganism surrounded by a coating comprising a hygroscopic salt in an too low amount, such as sample 12 (K2HPO4 (14% dry), KH2PO4 (11% dry), talc (22% dry) and sucrose (54% dry)).or the thermostability of coated dehydrated microorganism comprising dehydrated microorganism surrounded by a coating that does not comprise any hygroscopic salt (samples 13 and 14 comprise only a non hygroscopic salt, sodium sulphate and magnesium sulphate respectively)TABLE 3SampleBefore heat treatment (RT)After heat treatment (24hrs/50°C)Viability loss (Log)101.00E+102.80E+090.55111.40E+106.30E+090.35125.00E+092.60E+072.28135.50E+091.90E+063.46145.50E+092.80E+063.29RT= room temperature The samples were also tested under more stringent conditions, e.g. 64°C for 18 hours in order to better discriminate between the salt coatings providing high thermoprotection versus those providing lower thermoprotection.

On the contrary, coated bacteria L. acidophilus NCFM surrounded by a coating which either does not contain any hygroscopic salt (samples 13 and 14) or which contain hygroscopic salts in an insufficient amount (sample 12) or which does not have the suitable pH (samples 15 and 16) were much less resistant to heat compared to samples 25, 26, 27, 28 and 11. EXAMPLE 4 - Stability during Recombined Cheese Processing The recombined cheese trial involved the following steps: i) grinding of the curd,ii) addition of hydrocolloids (no melting salts) to give the right texture to the final product,iii) heating to 60°C, andiv) stirring at 60°C. Samples of uncoated (control) or coated L. acidophilus NCFM were added to the molten mixture under stirring at 60°C. The stirring was continued for about 1 minute and followed by the moulding phase. Finally the moulded recombined cheese containing L. acidophilus NCFM was rapidly cooled down. The viability of the coated dehydrated L. acidophilus NCFM in the recombined cheese process was then evaluated and compared against uncoated dehydrated L. acidophilus NCFM (control). Results are presented in Table 5.

Moreover, they also have an improved stability over the uncoated bacteria (sample 2), the fat-coated bacteria (sample 5), the polymer-coated bacteria (sample 8) and the fat-coated + polymer-subcoated bacteria (sample 9). This shows the efficiency of the coating according to the invention. EXAMPLE 5 - Feed Pelleting Stability Dehydrated L. acidophilus NCFM or L. plantarum Lp115 coated with a first coating consisting of a coating according to the invention followed by a polymer outercoating were pelletized using harsh conditions (see below). The stability of these bacteria following pelletization was compared to that of the uncoated dehydrated L. acidophilus NCFM or L. plantarum Lp115 (controls). Specifically, each test sample (i.e. 240 g of coated dehydrated bacteria) was mixed into 10 kg of premix feed and mixed for 10 min. This 10 kg premix feed (containing the 240 g of coated dehydrated bacteria) was then added to 150 kg of feed in a large horizontal mixer and mixed for 15 min before conditioning. The feed was then treated for 30 seconds at 75°C by injecting "dry steam" (i.e. 3.5 to 4.5 % wt water) directly into the feed prior to feed pelletization. The feed pellets were obtained using a 3 mm dye. The pellets were then cooled by blowing air around them using a fan. After 5 minutes, the temperature was lowered to 30°C. After 15 additional minutes, the temperature was again lowered to room temperature. At this stage, the pellets had a dry matter content (% DM) of about 80-90% and aw > 0.10. The concentration of viable bacteria remaining after pelletization was subsequently determined by standard plating methods.

EXAMPLE 6 - Stability in Intermediate Moisture Powder The viability of dehydrated L. acidophilus NCFM in freeze-dried form (control) and as coated dehydrated L. acidophilus NCFM (made by the liquid route) has been studied in the following conditions: Maltodextrine powder Glucidex IT6 from Roquette initially having a water activity (aw) equal to 0.2, was exposed to an environment in which the relative humidity was 40% until the 'aw' of the maltodextrine reached and equilibrated at an aw = 0.4. The bacteria preparation was mixed into the maltodextrin powder (aw = 0.4) at a ratio of 10%wt of coated bacteria and 90% wt of maltodextrin powder. 10 g of the mixture was then placed into glass vials which were subsequently sealed with a moisture proof cap. The vials were kept at 30°C in an incubator. Each month, a vial of the mixture was analyzed for its content of viable cells by standard plating methods. The results are listed in Table 7. The concentration of viable cells is expressed as CFU/g and as a percentage of the concentration of each samples at T=0.

See example 13 showing the effect of the pH on K2HPO4 coating. EXAMPLE 7 - Stability in Nutritional Bar Granola® bars were prepared as follows: hydrating pectin (GRINDSTED Pectin CF 140 B) in hot water under high agitation,blending it together with corn syrup (42 DE Corn Syrup) and sugar,heating the pectin slurry-corn syrup + sugar mixture to 106°C (∼12.5% water loss, 82% dry matter) to make the binding syrup,cooling the binding syrup to 55°C,pouring 410 g of the cooled binding syrup over 590 g of Cascadian Farms® granola cereal, and mixing thoroughly,rolling out the preparation between two sheets of oiled parchment paper and allowing to cool,cutting the rolled out preparation into 34g bars (each bar having a moisture content = 8.1 % and an aw = 0.5 at the time of manufacture),melting chocolate and adding the test samples containing the bacteria L. acidophilus NCFM in the chocolate at 28°C,depositing 6 g of the chocolate-bacteria mixture onto the bar (i.e. 6 g chocolate-bacteria mixture onto approximately 34 g of granola bar).the bars with the chocolate-bacteria mix were stored at 23°C (tables 8 and 9) or 30°C (table 10) and the concentration of viable cells was measured after a storage period of 1, 2, 3, 5, 9 and 12 months at 23°C or at 30°C, by standard plating methods.TABLE 8SampleAw at Time 0Time 01 Month2 Months3 Months5 MonthsProtection factor over control20.519.93E+09 (100%)5.10E+09 (51%)3.86E+09 (39%)1.21E+09 (12%)8.02E+08 (8%)n.a.4n.a.1.33E+10 (100%)6.54E+09 (49%)3.29E+09 (25%)1.63E+09 (12%)2.14E+08 (1.6%)06n.a.1.02E+10 (100%)5.98E+09 (58%)2.80E+09 (27%)1.06E+09 (10%)2.32E+08 (2%)070.541.16E+10 (100%)1.05E+10 (90%)5.51E+09 (47%)1.74E+09 (15%)5.72E+08 (5%)0n.a. non applicable (control) The results in Table 8 shows that when stored at 23°C, the viability of dehydrated L. acidophilus NCFM coated with conventional coatings such as fat (sample 4), low permeability polymer Sepifilm LP30 (sample 6) or shellac (sample 7) as previously described in the prior art is not maintained, the concentration of viable cells decreasing more than 1.5 LOG over a 5 months storage at 25°C in granola bars and providing no improved stability over the uncoated dehydrated bacteria (sample 2).

After 9 months storage at 30°C in the chocolate coating of the Granola® bar, the viability of L. acidophilus NCFM coated with the coating(s) according to the invention is significantly higher than the one obtained with uncoated microorganisms, for example, it is 1.5 LOG or 24 times higher after 9 months of storage with sample 11 (see figure 2 B). It is more than 2 LOG or more than 80 times higher for samples 17 and 18. In Table 11, the tested samples containing the microorganisms L. acidophilus were added directly into the cooled binding syrup and Cascadian Farms® granola cereal, and mixed thoroughly, before making the bars and storing them at ambiant temperature.

EXAMPLE 9 - MOISTURE UPTAKE RATE (MUR) DETERMINATION Glass desiccators containing saturated salt solutions of NaCl (in order to adjust the enclosed salt to 75% RH) were stored at 25°C. Various samples in open trays were loaded in the desiccators and incubated over time. The weight of the test material used is adjusted in order to ensure accurate weighing (e.g sample mass > 2 grams) as well as a low sample thickness (e.g. less than 1 cm) to avoid moisture content heterogeneity within the test sample. For exemple, the MUR test on K2HPO4 salt was done by adding 4.7 grams of K2HPO4 salt in a plastic tray. The plastric tray had the following charactistics: Mass of the tray: 3.4 gramsArea of the tray: 10.2 cm2 (circular tray with a diameter of 3.6 cm)Height of the tray: 1.5 cm For MUR experiments, the circular plastic tray is filled to half of its height with the sample to be tested. Subsequently, the moisture absorption of the sample was determined by weighing the samples before and during the incubation period at various time intervals. The MUR was determined for each measurement according to the equation 1.

It can be concluded also from the same table that magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), calcium lactate ((CH3CHOHCOOCa), sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), calcium carbonate (CaCO3), monopotassium phosphate (KH2PO4), sodium acetate tri hydrate ((CH3COO)2Na.3H2O) and tri-sodium citrate dihydrate (HOC(COONa)(CH2COONa)2) are considered as non hygroscopic salts according to this invention as they have MUR values (25°C, 75 % RH) at 7 days significantly less than 20% w/w. Figure 3 shows the the moisture uptake rate of coated dehydrated microorganisms samples. Glass desiccators containing saturated salt solutions of NaCl (in order to adjust the coated dehydrated microorganisms samples to 75% RH) were stored at 37°C. Various samples in open trays were loaded in the desiccators and incubated for 3 days. Subsequently, the moisture absorption of the samples was determined by weighing the samples before and during the incubation period at various time intervals. Figure 3 shows the % weight gain of the coated dehydrated microorganisms as a function of time at 75%RH and 37°C for 3 days. It can be concluded from Figure 3, that a coating which contains either 40% or 48% hygroscopic salt (K2HPO4) (samples 10 and 11) is better suited to absorb moisture, than a coating comprising only 14% hygroscopic salt (K2HPO4) and 76% optional other ingredients (talc and sucrose) (sample 12). This difference in moisture absorption is related to amount of hygroscopic salts and/or to the structure of the coating containing the hygroscopic salts, e.g. to the partially crystalline degree of the coating once processed. Coatings with a too low amount of hygroscopic salt (i.e. under 25%) at the expense of a too high optional other ingredients content (i.e. above 70%, sample 12) or coatings using only non hygroscopic salts (i.e. Na2SO4 in sample 13, MgSO4 in sample 14), are inefficient to absorb adequate amounts of moisture. EXAMPLE 10 - X-RAY POWDER DIFFRACTOMETRY Investigation into the nature of salt coatings as it relates to the stabilization effects on dehydrated microorganisms. The "crystalline" vs "amorphous" nature of the different salt coating has been determined using X-ray diffraction analysis. Description of method: An XRD-powder analysis is made by placing the material in the sample holder and the upper surface is levelled. The sample is placed in the X-ray diffractometer, where X-rays are focussed upon it. The X-rays are scattered depending on the arrangement of atoms in the sample. If the atoms are arranged in an ordered, repeating structure, as in crystals, the XRD pattern will show a series of sharp peaks. As every crystalline material produces a unique X-ray diffraction pattern, it is possible to determine the composition of a sample by subtracting known components from the sample pattern and then comparing the residual pattern with those in a library (e.g. The International Centre for Diffraction Data (ICDD) reference collection) or known reference patterns. Coated dehydrated microorganism: Coated dehydrated microorganism obtained by the liquid route, wherein the coating is K2HPO4 (48% dry), KH2PO4 (35% dry), talc (17% dry) and 0% sucrose, co-processed by spray-coating (sample 10) (Figure 4 - weakly crystalline). Coated microorganism obtained by the liquid route, wherein the coating is K2HPO4 (40% dry), KH2PO4 (29% dry), talc (14% dry) and sucrose (17% dry), co-processed by spray-coating (sample 11) (Figure 5 - weakly crystalline, salts not crystalline). Coated microorganism obtained by the liquid route, wherein the coating is K2HPO4 (14% dry), KH2PO4 (11% dry), talc (22% dry) and sucrose (54% dry) co-processed by spray-coating (sample 12) (Figure 6 - weakly crystalline, small amount of crystalline sucrose as anhydrate, salts not crystalline) Coated micro-organism prepared by the liquid route but with a coating of one non hygroscopic salt (KH2PO4) with talc co-processed by spray-coating (sample 16) (Figure 7 - Predominantly crystalline) Coated microorganism obtained by the solid route, wherein the coating is K2HPO4 (40% dry), KH2PO4 (29% dry), talc (14% dry) and sucrose (17%), co-processed by spray-coating (sample 20) (Figure 8 - weakly crystalline, thus largely amorphous) Coated microorganism obtained by the solid route, wherein the coating is Na2SO4, co-processed by spray-coating (sample 21) (Figure 9 - largely crystalline, thus weakly amorphous). The physical state of the coating produced according to the invention is shown to be partially crystalline. At high sucrose content (sample 12), the salts and sucrose mixture show the onset of sucrose crystallization, but there is no salt crystallization. However, as shown from figure 3, high sucrose content coatings (e.g. sample 12) reduced the MUR of the coated layer and therefore the benefits conferred by the low crystallinity solid state is significantly reduced. EXAMPLE 11 - DEGREE OF CRYSTALLINITY AND GLASS TRANSITION TEMPERATURE BY DIFFERENTIAL SCANNING CALORIMETRY (DSC) Method: The glass transition temperature of the coating and degree of crystallinity of the salt(s) in the coating of the present invention were obtained using DSC. A Netzch DSC 204 (Netzsch, Germany) equipped with an intracooler was used for all measurements with N2 as flushing agent. Samples of 10 mg were weighed into standard aluminium pans as quickly as possible to avoid water sorption. The pans were sealed and each sample was cooled and held at an initial temperature of -50°C for 2 minutes. The samples were then heated from -50°C to 330°C at 12°C min-1 and held at 330°C for 3 minutes. Preparation of samples: Tests were performed on the dried coating produced under the same process conditions as those used to apply the coating onto the dehydrated microorganisms of the present invention. The coating analyzed in this test was not applied onto the primary particle to avoid interference from the core. Indeed, peaks from the core material were found to occur at the same temperature as some of the peaks of the coating materials 30 wt% aqueous solutions of the mono-potassium phosphate (KH2PO4) dipotassium phosphate (K2HPO4) and mixture of 45% K2HPO4, 35% KH2PO4, and 20% sucrose were prepared and each solution was atomized and dried in the fluid-bed, resulting respectively in sample A, B and C Table 14 described the composition of the dried salt coatings (samples A, B and C) analysed by DSC and Table 15 summarizes the process parameters used to these samples. The samples were post-dried for 15 min at product temperature of 55°C.

The heat of crystallization will depend on the amount of crystalline material present in the sample. Interpretation of thermogram of these three samples are shown in Figures 10, 11 and 12. The crystalline melting point (onset temperature) and the heat of crystallization (area in J per g) were determined for each crystallization peak observed and are reported in Table 16. TABLE 16Endothermic peaks (T°C and area in J/g)K2HPO4KH2PO4sampleT°C*Area in J/g (K2HPO4)T°C*Area in J/g (KH2PO4)A255.1-244.2B45.5-38.7C46.8-9.2256.3-13.1* area corresponds to heat of crystallization For KH2PO4, a crystalline melting point with onset T°C=255°C and heat of crystallization -244.2 J/g was measured. For K2HPO4, a crystalline melting point with onset T°C=45°C and heat of crystallization -38 J/g was measured. For the KH2PO4/K2HPO4/sucrose mixture, a peak was measured at 256.3°C i.e. in the same T°C range as that of KH2PO4 but its heat of crystallization -13.1 J/g was lower than that measured for KH2PO4 (sample A) anda peak was measured at 46.8°C, i.e. in the same T°C range as that of K2HPO4 but its heat of crystallization 9.2 J/g was lower than that measured for K2HPO4 (sample B) Taking into account the quantity of each phosphate salt present in the mixture, e.g. 35 wt% KH2PO4 and 45wt% K2HPO4, and if both salts were 100 % crystalline in the mixture, each salt should result in a heat of crystallization of 85.5 J/g for KH2PO4 (85.5 J/g = -244.2 J/g x 35 wt% of KH2PO4) and17.4 J/g for K2HPO4 (17.4 J/g =-38.7 x 45 wt% of K2HPO4) However, the measured values for the coating (sample C) were much lower than estimated if both salts were 100 % crystalline in the mixture 13.1 J/g for the peak with onset 256.3°C corresponding to KH2PO4 and9.2 J/g for the peak with onset 46.8°C corresponding to K2HPO4. The degree of crystallinity of each salt in the coating can hence be determined as following: 13.1 / -85.5 = 15.3 %, e.g. KH2PO4 is 15.3% crystalline and 84.7% amorphous9.2/-17.4 = 52.9%, e.g. K2HPO4 is 52.9% crystalline and 47.1% amorphous In 1g of the coating, there is 0.35g of KH2PO4 and 0.45g of K2HPO4 0.35g x 15.3 % crystalinity = 0.053g of KH2PO4 in a crystalline form 0.45g x 52.9% crystallinity = 0.238g of K2HPO4 in a crystalline form Hence, the total amount of salts (KH2PO4 + K2HPO4) in a crystalline form is 0.2916 g (0.053 g + 0.238 g) per g of coating, so the crystallinity degree of the salts in the coating, once processed, is of 29.1%. Interpretation of DSC data (part 2): In addition, a glass transition temperature was measured for the sample C (35% KH2PO4, 45% K2HPO4 and 20% sucrose), as shown from Figure 4. The presence of a Tg implies the presence of amorphous structure for the coating, validating the above approach using the heat of crystallization. Conclusion from DSC data interpretation: a semi-crystalline structure was identified for fluid-bed dried sample C composition with a glass transition temperature. The degree of crystallinity of the salt(s) in the coating has been quantified to around 29%. EXAMPLE 12 - WATER VAPOR SORPTION ISOTHERM Preparation of samples: Coated dehydrated microorganisms were produced with various coatings following the process according to the invention. These coatings were the equivalent to the ones described in table 1, "1st coating", of sample references n°10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28. The coating was applied either on the dehydrated microorganism (labelled "+ cells") or directly on the core in the absence of the dehydrated microorganism (labelled "- cells"). The amount of coating applied was 30 wt%. The process parameters were: Process parametersValuesStep-upBottom sprayNozzle1.2 mmInlet temperature65-70°CProduct temperature55°CAtomization pressure2-2.5 barsAir Flow120-200m3/h Method: In order to generate the sorption isotherms, each of the different samples were placed in a series of glass dessicators, each containing saturated salt solutions of certain salts, in order to adjust the samples to relative humidities (% RH) of 11.3%, 22.5%, 32.8%, 43% and 75%. Table 17 summarizes the salts used to achieve the targeted relative humidity at 25°C. TABLE 17SaltLiClKCH2CO2MgCl2K2CO3NaCl% RH (25°C)11.3%22.5%32.8%43%75% The glass dessicator containing the samples were kept at constant temperature, e.g. 25°C. Each sample was weighed at regular interval (t). The Moisture Uptake Rate MUR(t) was determinate for each measurement according to the equation 1 (previously described in exemple 9) and an water vapour sorption isotherm was drawn (MUR (t) = f (t), were MUR (t) represent the percentage of the water uptake as measured by % weight gain of the sample at the time of measurement. Brief explanation of the figures: Figure 13 is a water vapor sorption isotherm at 25°C for microorganisms coated with different salt coating compositions, exposed to relative humidity conditions ranging from 11.3%, 22.5%, 32.8%, 43% and 75% RH at 25°C for 28 days. Figure 14 to 19 concern water wapor sorption isotherms at 25°C for particles including coated dehydrated microorganism exposed to various relative humidity conditions ranging from 11.3%, 22.5%, 32.8%, 43% and 75% RH for 28 days. The particles are composed of: the core only (●)the core + the cell layer (*) - referred as "reference sample"the core + the salt coating ( )the core + cell layer + salt coating (◊) - referred as "product" or coated dehydrated microorganism The salt coatings were the ones described as 1st coating in table 1, i.e. sample 11 (Fig. 14), sample 10 (Fig. 15), sample 15 (Fig. 16), sample 13 (Fig. 17), sample 12 (Fig.18), sample 16 (Fig 19). Data interpretation (Figure 13, Table 18 and Table 19): The water sorption curves of the water vapor sorption isotherms allow a quantification of the effect of humidity on the moisture content of the coated dehydrated microorganisms. The Moisture Uptake Rate of the coated dehydrated microorganism or "product" was measured at 25°C, 75%RH at 2, 7 and 28 days days (Table 18). The MUR values presented in Table 19 were calculated for the coating according to equation 2.

Samples 25, 15, 10, 11 are highly hygroscopic, absorbing between 9 wt% and 19 wt% of moisture per weight of the coated dehydrated microorganism. Sample 25 (MgCl2) and sample 15 (K2HPO4) are the most hygroscopic. In addition, the water sorption profile in figure 13 shows a gradual increase in water content, which is characteristic of an amorphous or partially amorphous structure. In contrast, samples previously shown to offer little protection to the microorganism, e.g. sample 13 (Na2SO4), sample 14 (MgSO4), sample 16 (KH2PO4) absorbed negligeable amount of water. The MUR of the salt coating was determined based on equation 3 and is reported in Table 19.

Samples 25, 15, 10 and 11 absorb a high amount of moisture and exhibit a strong change in the water content of the coating. Sample 25 (MgCl2) and sample 15 (K2HPO4) are the most hygroscopic. In contrast, Na2SO4 (in sample 13), (MgSO4 (in sample 14) and KH2PO4 (in sample 16) absorbed negligeable amount of water and resulted in a very small change in its water content of the coating. The graphs from Fig. 14 to 17 show significant differences in how much water is absorbed in particles with different cores materials (core only, core + cell layer) but identical salt coating. As shown in Fig 14, Fig 15 and Fig 16, salt formulations containing hygroscopic salts (samples 10, 11 and 15) exhibit no difference in the quantity of moisture absorbed by particles with and without cells. As shown in Fig 17, Fig. 18, Fig 19, salt formulations with less than 25% of hygroscopic salts (sample 12) or composed of only non hygroscopic salts (samples 13 and 16), exhibit a significant difference in the quantity of moisture absorbed with and without cells. The particle with the cell layer (e.g. the coated dehydrated microorganisms) absorbs a greater amount of moisture compared to particules without the cell layer. This results shows that if the coating allows moisture to pass, the underlaying material will absorb greater amount of moisture. This is seen for samples containing the cell layer when the coating contains less than 25% of hygroscopic salts (sample 12) or do not contain any hygroscopic salts but non-hygroscopic salt instead (samples 13 and 16). These samples do not maintain cell viability under stressfull conditions. EXAMPLE 13 - The effect of pH of the salt coating on the survival of the coated dehydrated L acidophilus NCFM. Results from the effect of pH of the salt coating on the survival of the coated dehydrated L acidophilus NCFM are presented in Table 20. K2HPO4 is an alkaline salt and the pH of the K2HPO4 solution prior to coating was adjusted to a pH=6.5 using lactic acid. This resulted in a reduction of pH of the coated dehydrated microorganisms from pH 8 to pH 6.5 when measured as 10 wt% solution of the coated dehydrated microorganism in water. A significant improvement in the resistance of L. acidophilus NCFM was observed: i) during fluid-bed coating with process survival for L. acidophilus NCFM raised from 65% to 90%,ii) after 14 days of storage at 37°C in dry conditions with recovery of viable L. acidophilus NCFM increased from 7% to 83%,iii) after heat treatment (64°C/18 hrs) with LOG loss for L. acidophilus NCFM reduced from more than 5.3 to 0.6. K2HPO4 coating with pH adjusted to 6.5 remained hygroscopic with a moisture uptake for the coated dehydrated microorganism of 12.8 wt% moisture absorbed prior to pH adjustement and 11.6 wt% moisture absorbed after pH adjustement. (Conditions: 75% RH, 25°C, 6 days). These results demonstrate that it is needed to have the pH of the coating compatible with the viability of the microorganism. KH2PO4 is an acid salt and the pH of the KH2PO4 solution prior to coating was adjusted to pH 6.5 using Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH). This resulted in an increase of pH from pH 5.0 to pH 6.5 when measured after suspended the coated dehydrated microorganism into 10 wt% of water. A significant reduction in the viability loss of L. acidophilus NCFM was observed: i) during fluid-bed coating with process survival of L. acidophilus NCFM was raised from 47% to 100%,ii) after 14 days of storage at 30°C in dry conditions with an increase in the recovery of viable L. acidophilus NCFM from 2% to 95%.iii) after heat treatment (64°C/18 hrs) with LOG loss for viable L. acidophilus NCFM reduced from > 5,0 to 0,6iv) storage in maltodextrine Aw=0.4 (37°C/9 days) with an increase in the recovery of viable L. acidophilus NCFM from 1% to 44%. The hygrosocpicity of KH2PO4 coating with pH adjusted to 6.5 could be dramatically increased with moisture uptake of the coated dehydrated microorganism going from 1.3% prior to pH adjustement to 12.8wt% moisture absorbed after pH adjustement with NaOH (conditions: 75%RH, 25°C, 6 days). These results showed that by pH adjustement it was possible to obtain a coating suitable by transformation of the non-hygroscopic nature into a hygroscopic one, hereby enabling stabilization of L. acidophilus NCFM in various stress conditions.

The bacteria preparation was mixed into the maltodextrin powder (aw = 0.4) at a ratio of 10%wt of coated bacteria and 90% wt of maltodextrin powder. The vials were kept at 30°C in an incubator. After 2 months storage at 30°C, a vial of the mixture was analyzed for its content of viable cells by standard plating methods. The results are listed in Table 21. The concentration of viable cells is expressed as CFU/g and as a percentage of the concentration of each samples at T=0.

The effectiveness of the coating of the invention in stabilizing dehydrated microorganisms was previously demonstrated for the coated dehydrated microorganism prepared according to the liquid route. It is now demonstrated in this exemple that the coating of the invention is also effective for coated dehydrated microorganism prepared according to the solid route. EXEMPLE 15 - stability in infant formula The viability of L. acidophilus NCFM in freeze-dried form (sample 2) and in the coated dehydrated microorganisms according to the present invention (sample 11) has been studied in the following conditions: The test samples were blended into commercial "Good Sense Gentle Plus" Instant Baby Formula from Nestle (Aw=0.157) at a ratio of test sample to baby formula powder of 1:10. The mixtures were then divided into 10 g samples in separate sealed hermetic sachets. The sachets were kept in an incubator at 30°C. At time 0 and after 1, 3, 6 and 9 months of storage at 30°C, a sachet of each blend was analysed for the content of viable cells, by standard plating methods.TABLE 22SampleAw T= 0T=01 Months3 Months6 Months9 Months*Protection factor over control (2)20.172,7E+10 (100%)1.2E+10 (43.6%)1.1E+10 (39,6%)1,0E+10 (36,6%)1.7E+09 (6%)n.a.110.151.4E+09 (100%)1.45E+09 (104%)1.47E+09 (105%)1,2E+09 (85%)1,2E+08 (86%)14n.a. non applicable (control) * Protection factor calculated at 9 month- storage, 30°C The results from Table 22 show that the presence of the coating according to the invention (samples 11) improves stability over uncoated dehydrated bacteria (sample 2).
