Model for a factor IX activation complex on blood platelets: dimeric conformation of factor XIa is essential.
Human coagulation factor XI (FXI) is a plasma serine protease composed of 2 identical 80-kd polypeptides connected by a disulfide bond.
This dimeric structure is unique among blood coagulation enzymes.
The hypothesis was tested that dimeric conformation is required for normal FXI function by generating a monomeric version of FXI (FXI/PKA4) and comparing it to wild-type FXI in assays requiring factor IX activation by activated FXI (FXIa).
FXI/PKA4 was made by replacing the FXI A4 domain with the A4 domain from prekallikrein (PK).
A dimeric version of FXI/PKA4 (FXI/PKA4-Gly326) was prepared as a control.
Activated FXI/PKA4 and FXI/PKA4-Gly326 activate factor IX with kinetic parameters similar to those of FXIa.
In kaolin-triggered plasma clotting assays containing purified phospholipid, FXI/PKA4 and FXI/PKA4-Gly326 have coagulant activity similar to FXI.
The surface of activated platelets is likely to be a physiologic site for reactions involving FXI/FXIa.
In competition binding assays FXI/PKA4, FXI/PKA4-Gly326, and FXI have similar affinities for activated platelets (K(i) = 12-16 nM).
In clotting assays in which phospholipid is replaced by activated platelets, the dimeric proteins FXI and FXI/PKA4-Gly326 promote coagulation similarly; however, monomeric FXI/PKA4 has greatly reduced activity.
Western immunoblot analysis confirmed that activated monomeric FXI/PKA4 activates factor IX poorly in the presence of activated platelets.
These findings demonstrate the importance of the dimeric state to FXI activity and suggest a novel model for factor IX activation in which FXIa binds to activated platelets by one chain of the dimer, while binding to factor IX through the other.
