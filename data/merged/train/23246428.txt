UPLC-Q-TOF/HSMS/MS(E)-based metabonomics for adenine-induced changes in metabolic profiles of rat faeces and intervention effects of ergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraen-3-one.
Ergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraen-3-one (ergone), isolated from the medicinal fungus Polyporus umbellatus, has been proven to prevent the progression of renal injury and the subsequent renal fibrosis.
Ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight high-sensitivity mass spectrometry and a novel mass spectrometry(Elevated Energy) (MS(E)) data collection technique was employed to investigate metabonomic characters of chronic renal failure (CRF) induced adenine and the protective effects of ergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraen-3-one (ergone).
Coupled with blood biochemistry and kidney histopathology results, the significant difference in metabolic profiling between adenine-induced CRF group and ergone-treated CRF group by using pattern recognition analysis indicated that changes in global faecal metabolites were occurred.
Seven endogenous metabolites were identified by using metabonomic method combined with multivariate data analysis, the accurate mass, isotopic pattern, MS(E) fragments information and MassLynx i-FIT algorithm.
These biochemical changes in faecal metabolites are related to the perturbations of bile acid metabolism and phospholipid metabolism, which may be helpful to further understand the CRF and therapeutic mechanisms of ergone.
This research proved that MS(E) can simultaneous acquire precursor ion information and fragment ion data at high and low collision energy in one analytical run, which facilitated the fast structural characterization of metabolites.
