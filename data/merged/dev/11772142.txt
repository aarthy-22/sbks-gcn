Rabeprazole: an update of its use in acid-related disorders.
UNLABELLED: Rabeprazole is an inhibitor of the gastric proton pump.
It causes dose-dependent inhibition of acid secretion.
In 8-week studies, among patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), rabeprazole 20 mg/day or 10mg twice daily was as effective as omeprazole and superior to ranitidine in the healing of GORD.
Symptom relief with rabeprazole was superior to that provided by placebo and ranitidine and similar to omeprazole.
In long-term trials rabeprazole 10 mg/day was similar to omeprazole 20 mg/day in a 2-year study and superior to placebo in 1-year studies, in both the maintenance of healing and prevention of symptoms in patients with healed GORD.
In nonerosive GORD, 4-week studies have shown rabeprazole to be more effective than placebo in relieving heartburn and various other gastrointestinal symptoms.
Data among patients with Barrett's oesophagus suggest rabeprazole 20 mg/day may be more effective than placebo in maintaining healing of associated oesophagitis after 1 year of treatment.
One-week triple Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy with rabeprazole plus clarithromycin and amoxicillin achieved eradication rates of > or =85%.
Rabeprazole is as effective as omeprazole and lansoprazole when included as part of a triple-therapy regimen for the eradication of H. pylori.
Eradication rates of >90% were achieved when rabeprazole 20 to 40 mg/day was included as part of a quadruple eradication regimen.
As monotherapy for peptic ulcer healing and symptom relief, 4- to 8-week studies have shown rabeprazole 10 to 40 mg/day to be superior to placebo and ranitidine and have similar efficacy to omeprazole.
Preliminary 1-year data among 16 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome suggest rabeprazole 60 to 120 mg/day can resolve and prevent the recurrence of symptoms and endoscopic lesions associated with this condition.
In clinical trials of up to 2 years' duration the tolerability of rabeprazole is similar to that of placebo, ranitidine and omeprazole.
Common adverse events assigned to rabeprazole have been diarrhoea, headache, rhinitis, nausea, pharyngitis and abdominal pain.
Histological changes and increases in serum gastrin levels were unremarkable and typical of proton pump inhibitors.
No dosage adjustment is necessary in renal and mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
CONCLUSION: Rabeprazole is a well tolerated proton pump inhibitor.
It has proven efficacy in healing, symptom relief and prevention of relapse of peptic ulcers and GORD and can form part of effective H. pylori eradication regimens.
It is an important alternative to H(2) antagonists and an additional treatment option to other proton pump inhibitors in the management of acid-related disorders.
