Pyrrolopyrazines as Selective Spleen Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors.
We describe the discovery of several pyrrolopyrazines as potent and selective Syk inhibitors and the efforts that eventually led to the desired improvements in physicochemical properties and human whole blood potencies.
Ultimately, our mouse model revealed unexpected toxicity that precluded us from further advancing this series.
