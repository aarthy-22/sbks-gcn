Embodiments of the invention are depicted in the figures and will be discussed in the following. Fig. 1 shows a schematic view of a household appliance; Fig. 2 shows a perspective view of a ground plate having inwardly bent roller mounting portions; and Fig. 3 shows a perspective view of a ground plate having inwardly bent roller mounting portions. Fig. 1 shows a refrigerator representing a household appliance 100 having an upper and a lower refrigerator door 113 and 115. On a bottom face 117 the household appliance 100 comprises rolls for manually moving the household appliance 100. The refrigerator serves for example for cooling of food and comprises a refrigerant and a refrigerant circulation having an evaporator, a refrigerant compressor, a condenser and a flow reducing valve (not depicted). The evaporator is a heat exchanger in which, after expansion, the liquid refrigerant is vaporized by absorbing heat from the medium to be refrigerated. The refrigerant compressor is a mechanically operated component which withdraws refrigerant vapor from the evaporator and discharges it at a higher pressure to the condenser. The condenser is a heat exchanger in which, after compression, vaporized refrigerant is liquefied by rejecting heat to an external cooling medium. Flow reducing valve is a device for reducing the flow by narrowing the crosssection. The refrigerant is a fluid used for heat transfer in a refrigerating system, which absorbs heat at a low temperature and a low pressure of the fluid and rejects heat at a higher temperature and a higher pressure of the fluid, usually involving changes of state of the fluid. Fig. 2 shows a perspective view of a ground plate 101 having inwardly bent roller mounting portions 103-1, 103-2. The ground plate 101 comprises roller mounting portions 103-1, 103-2 like metal tongue pieces that each have an opening 105 for accommodating a pivot 107 of a roller 109. The roller mounting portions 103-1, 103-2 are bent up into an interior direction of the household device 100 for mounting the pivot 107 internally so that in combination with small diameter rollers 109 a minimum ground clearance is reached. With this assembly, for example, a compressor traverse design for minimum ground clearance can be realized. The ground plate 101 has a tray like form and is formed from a metal sheet material. The ground plate 101 can be a compressor traverse of a refrigerator. The roller 109 is located between the parallel bent roller mounting portions 103-1 and 103-2. The roller mounting portions 103-1, 103-2 are bent perpendicularly with respect to the ground plate 101. For mounting the roller 109 the pivot is inserted in sideward direction into the openings 105 of the mounting portions 103-1 and 103-2 and the roller 109. The pivot 107 can be made from steel or plastics, such as a steel pin. The opening 105 for accommodating the pivot 107 may have an internal thread for fixing the pivot 107 so that an external thread of the pivot 107 can be screwed into the internal thread of the opening 105. Further the pivot 107 can be secured with respect to the roller mounting portions 103-1 and 103-2 by a retaining ring. The ground plate 101 comprises a stopper portion 111 adjoining one end of the pivot 107. The stopper portion 111 is formed by a bend piece of the ground plate 101, which is bent into the interior direction of the household device 100. Fig. 3 shows a perspective view of the ground plate 101 having inwardly bent roller mounting portions 103-1, 103-2. The roller mounting portions 103-1, 103-2 are bent down into an exterior direction of the household device 100 for mounting the pivot 107 externally so that in combination with large diameter rollers 109 a maximum ground clearance is reached. With this assembly, for example, a compressor traverse design for maximum ground clearance can be realized. Accordingly various ground clearances for house appliances can be adjusted in dependence on the mounting of the pivot 107 and the diameter of the rollers 109, as for example in refrigerators. In particular minimum and maximum ground clearance can be reached by bending the lip or flange of the roller mounting portions 103-1, 103-2 in either upwards or downwards direction. By using different diameter rollers 109 mounted on the pivot 107 ground clearances can be additionally adapted. The pivot 107 is on its longitudinal side in direct contact with a surface of the ground plate 101 so that the ground plate 101 is supported by the horizontal pivot 107. The roller 109 is rotatable with respect to the pivot 107 which is ηοηrotatable. The stopper portion 111 is bent into the exterior direction of the household device 100 for mounting the pivot 107 externally. All features discussed or shown with respect to particular embodiments of the invention can be provided in any combination in order to realize their advantageous effects concurrently. The scope of the invention is given by the patent claims and is not restricted by the features discussed in the description or shown in the figures.
