Effects of High Iron and Glucose Concentrations over the Relative Expression of Bcl2, Bax, and Mfn2 in MIN6 Cells.
Type 2 diabetes is characterized by hyperglycemia and oxidative stress.
Hyperglycemia is linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced β-cell mass due to the reduced expression of genes such as Mfn2 as well as the participation of the Bcl2 gene family, responsible for increased apoptosis.
The purpose of this study was to describe the effect of different iron and/or glucose concentrations over Mfn2, Bax, and Bcl2 expressions in a β-pancreatic cell line (MIN6 cells).
MIN6 cells were pre-incubated with different iron and/or glucose concentrations, and the relative mRNA abundance of the Bcl2/Bax ratio and of Mfn2 genes was measured by qRT-PCR.
Heme oxygenase (HO) activity, iron uptake, superoxide dismutase activity, and glutathione content were also determined.
The Bcl2/Bax ratio increased and Mfn2 expression decreased in MIN6 cells after glucose stimulation.
These effects were higher when glucose and iron were incubated together.
Additionally, treatment with glucose/iron showed a higher HO activity.
Our study revealed that high glucose/Fe concentrations in MIN6 cells induced an increase of the Bcl2/Bax ratio, an indicator of increased cell apoptosis.
