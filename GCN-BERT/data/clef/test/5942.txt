FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to novel benzotriazole derivatives. More specifically, the invention relates to novel benzotriazole derivatives into which a pyridine ring structure has been introduced and to organic electroluminescent devices that have an organic layer containing the above derivatives between the electrodes. BACKGROUND ART An organic electroluminescent device (hereinafter often called organic EL device) is a spontaneously luminous device which features higher brightness and higher legibility than those of the liquid crystal devices enabling vivid display to be attained and has, therefore, been vigorously studied. In 1987, C. W. Tang et al. of the Eastman Kodak Co. have developed a device of a layer-laminated structure comprising various kinds of materials to bear individual roles, and have put an organic EL device using organic materials into a practical use. The above organic EL device is constituted by laminating layers of a fluorescent body capable of transporting electrons and an organic material capable of transporting holes. Upon injecting both electric charges into the layer of the fluorescent body to emit light, the device is capable of attaining a brightness of as high as 1000 cd/m2 or more with a voltage of not higher than 10 V. So far, very many improvements have been made to put the organic EL device to practical use. For example, the organic EL device has been widely known having a structure comprising an anode, a hole injection layer, a hole-transporting layer, a luminous layer, an electron-transporting layer, an electron injection layer and a cathode which are arranged in this order on a substrate more finely dividing their roles than ever before. The device of this kind is achieving a high efficiency and a high durability. To further improve the luminous efficiency, attempts have been made to utilize triplet excitons and study has been forwarded to utilize a phosphorescent luminous compound. In the organic EL device, the electric charges injected from the two electrodes recombine together in the luminous layer to emit light. Here, however, the hole migration rate is higher than the electron migration rate arousing a problem of a decrease in the efficiency since the holes partly pass through the luminous layer. Therefore, it has been desired to provide an electron-transporting material that has a higher electron migration rate. Tris(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum (hereinafter abbreviated as Alq3) which is a representative luminous material has also been generally used as an electron-transporting material having, however, a low electron mobility and a work function of 5.6 eV and, therefore, having a hole-locking capability which is far from satisfactory. A method of inserting a hole-blocking layer is one of the measures for preventing the holes from partly passing through the luminous layer to improve the probability of recombination of the electric charge in the luminous layer. As a hole-blocking material used for forming the hole-blocking layer, for example, a patent document 1 discloses a 3-(4-biphenylyl)-4-phenyl-5-(4-t-butylphenyl)-1,2,4-triazole (hereinafter abbreviated as TAZ). As the hole-blocking material, there have, further, been known a bathocuproin (hereinafter abbreviated as BCP) and a mixed ligand complex of aluminum such as aluminum (III) bis(2-methyl-8-quinolinato)-4-phenyl phenolate (hereinafter abbreviated as BAlq). The TAZ has a work function of as large as 6.6 eV and a large hole-blocking power, and is used for forming an electron-transporting hole-blocking layer that is laminated on the cathode side of a fluorescent luminous layer or a phosphorescent luminous layer prepared by vacuum evaporation or by coating and, therefore, contributes to improving the efficiency of the organic EL devices. Because of its low electron-transporting capability, however, the TAZ had to be used in combination with an electron-transporting material having a higher electron-transporting capability. The BCP, on the other hand, has a work function of as large as 6.7 eV and a large hole-blocking power but a glass transition point (Tg) of as low as 83° C. In the form of a thin film, therefore, the BCP lacks stability and still leaves much room for improvement for forming a hole-blocking layer that works maintaining stability. A patent document 2 discloses a general electron-transporting compound which, however, still lacks stability when it is formed into a film or lacks the function for blocking the holes to a sufficient degree. In order to improve characteristics of the organic electroluminescent devices, therefore, it has been desired to provide an organic compound that excels in electron injection/transport capability and in hole-blocking power, and features high stability in the form of a thin film. PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS Patent document 1: Japanese Patent No. 2734341 Patent document 2: WO2003/060956 OUTLINE OF THE INVENTION Problems that the Invention is to Solve The object of the present invention is to provide a novel organic compound that excels in electron injection/transport capability, features a high hole-blocking power and a high stability in the form of a thin film, and can be used as a material for producing highly efficient and highly durable organic electroluminescent devices.

According to the present invention, further, there is provided an organic electroluminescent device having a pair of electrodes and at least one organic layer interposed therebetween, wherein at least one of the organic layers contains the benzotriazole derivative. In the organic EL device of the invention, the organic layer containing the benzotriazole derivative is, for example, an electron-transporting layer, a hole-blocking layer, a luminous layer or an electron injection layer.

For instance, the organic EL device forming the electron injection layer and/or the electron-transporting layer by using the benzotriazole derivative of the invention, features a high electron injection/migration rate, an improved electron transport efficiency from the electron-transporting layer into the luminous layer and, therefore, features a high luminous efficiency, a low driving voltage and a large durability. Further, the organic EL device having a hole-blocking layer formed by using the benzotriazole derivative of the invention features excellent hole-blocking power and electron transport capability and, therefore, requires a decreased driving voltage yet maintaining a high luminous efficiency and, besides, features an improved resistance against the electric current and an improved maximum brightness. Further, the benzotriazole derivative of the invention features excellent electron transport capability and a wide band gap and can, therefore, be used as a host material for the luminous layer.

The aromatic hydrocarbon group and the aromatic heterocyclic group in Ar1 and Ar2 may have a monocyclic structure or a condensed polycyclic structure. Examples of these aromatic groups include phenyl group, biphenylyl group, terphenylyl group, tetrakisphenyl group, styryl group, naphthyl group, anthryl group, acenaphthenyl group, phenanthryl group, fluorenyl group, indenyl group, pyrenyl group, triazyl group, pyrimidyl group, furanyl group, pyrolyl group, thienyl group, quinolyl group, isoquinolyl group, benzofuranyl group, benzothienyl group, indolyl group, carbazolyl group, benzooxazolyl group, benzothiazolyl group, quinoxalyl group, benzoimidazolyl group, pyrazolyl group, dibenzofuranyl group, dibenzothienyl group, naphthyridinyl group, phenanthrolinyl group and acridinyl group. Among these aromatic heterocyclic groups, preferred are sulfur-containing aromatic heterocyclic groups such as thienyl group, benzothienyl group, benzothiazolyl group and dibenzothienyl group. However, nitrogen-containing aromatic heterocyclic groups and, specifically, such groups as pyridyl group and the like groups are not desired from the standpoint of bipolar property. The above aromatic groups (aromatic hydrocarbon groups and aromatic heterocyclic groups) may have a substituent. As the substituent, there can be exemplified deuterium atom; fluorine atom; chlorine atom; cyano group; hydroxyl group; nitro group; straight-chain or branched alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms; cyclic alkyl group (e.g., cyclopentyl group, cyclohexyl group); straight-chain or branched alkoxy group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms; dialkylamino group substituted with a straight-chain or branched alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms; aryl groups such as phenyl group, naphthyl group, anthryl group, fluorenyl group and styryl group; and aromatic heterocyclic groups such as pyridyl group, pyridoindolyl group, quinolyl group and benzothiazolyl group. These substituents may, further, have a substituent like trifluoromethyl group. Examples of the alkyl group portion of the alkyl group and the alkoxy group in the above-mentioned substituents may be the same as those exemplified for the alkyl groups represented by R1 to R8 in the general formula (2) that will be described below. In the above general formula (1), the monovalent group A has a pyridine ring, and is represented by the following formula (2), In the above formula (2), m is an integer of 0, 1 or 2. Further, X in the ring is a carbon atom or a nitrogen atom. R1 to R8 are, respectively, hydrogen atoms, deuterium atoms, fluorine atoms, chlorine atoms, cyano groups, alkyl groups having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, aromatic hydrocarbon groups or aromatic heterocyclic groups. There is no specific limitation on the alkyl group so far as it has carbon atoms in a number in a range of 1 to 6; i.e., the alkyl group may have a straight-chain or branched structure, and may be methyl group, ethyl group, n-propyl group, i-propyl group, n-butyl group, 2-methylpropyl group, t-butyl group, n-pentyl group, 3-methylbutyl group, t-pentyl group, n-hexyl group, i-hexyl group or t-hexyl group.

A representative example of the substituted alkyl group is a trifluoromethyl group. The above aromatic hydrocarbon groups and aromatic heterocyclic groups may be the same groups as those exemplified for the groups Ar1 and Ar2. Further, these aromatic groups may have substituents and, besides, the kinds of the substituents may be the same as those exemplified for the groups Ar1 and Ar2. In the above formula (2), when X is a nitrogen atom (i.e., when the ring that includes X is a pyridine ring), none of the groups R1 to R4 are bonded to the nitrogen atom, and any one of R1 to R4 is not present. When m is 2, further, a plurality of R1, R2, R3 or R4 may be the same or different from each other. Further, a plurality of X may be different from each other. For instance, the benzene ring (X═C) and the pyridine ring (X═N) may be bonded in a form of being mixed together to the pyridine ring at a terminal. The benzotriazole derivative of the invention represented by the above general formula (1) is synthesized, for example, by a method described below. First, a 2-aminoarylazobenzene derivative including a pyridyl group that has the groups R5 to R8 in the general formula (2) is synthesized from a 1,2-diaminobenzene derivative and a nitroarylpyridine derivative according to a known method. The 2-aminoarylazobenzene derivative is subjected to an oxidative cyclization reaction with an iodobenzenediacetate to synthesize a 2-arylbenzotriazole derivative having the above pyridyl group as a substituent (e.g., see Aust. J. Chem., 45, 371 (1992)). The thus obtained 2-arylbenzotriazole derivative and various arylboron acid derivatives are subjected to a cross-coupling reaction such as Suzuki coupling to synthesize the benzotriazole derivative of the present invention represented by the general formula (1). The obtained compound is refined by a column chromatography, by an adsorption refining using silica gel, activated carbon or activated clay, by a recrystallization method using a solvent or by a crystallization method. The compound is identified by the NMR analysis. In the benzotriazole derivative of the invention, X in the group represented by the above formula (2) is desirably a carbon atom. The benzotriazole derivative, in this case, is represented by the following general formula (1-1), wherein, Ar1, Ar2, R1 to R8 and m are as defined in the above general formula (1).

The benzotriazole derivative, in this case, is represented by the following general formula (1a), wherein, Ar1, Ar2, R1 to R8 and m are as defined in the above general formula (1). Further, the benzotriazole derivatives represented by the above general formula (1a) can be classified into the compounds represented, for example, by the following general formulas (1a-1) to (1a-4) depending upon the coupling position of the benzene ring that is interposed between the benzotriazole ring and the pyridine ring.

Moreover, the benzotriazole derivative of the invention features good electron injection property, a high electron migration rate and a high electron-blocking power. For example, a film formed by vapor-depositing the compound of the invention in a thickness of 100 nm can be measured for its work function to exhibit a very high value. Therefore, the benzotriazole derivative of the invention is very useful as a material for forming an organic layer of an organic EL device. <Organic EL Device> The organic EL device having the organic layer formed by using the above compound of the present invention has a structure of layers as shown, for example, in FIG. 21.

The organic EL device to which the compound of the present invention is applied is not limited to the one of the above layer structure, as a matter of course. For instance, the organic EL device may have an electron-blocking layer formed between the luminous layer 4 and the hole-transporting layer 3, or may have a simplified layer structure omitting the electron injection layer 7 and the hole-blocking layer 5. For instance, some layers can be omitted from the above multilayer structure.

In the organic EL device, the transparent anode 2 may be formed by using an electrode material which has been known per se, i.e., by vapor-depositing an electrode material having a large work function, such as ITO or gold on the substrate 1. Further, the hole injection layer that is not shown (and that can be formed between the transparent electrode 2 and the hole-transporting layer 3) can be formed by using the material that have been known per se, such as those described below.

The compounds which are the hole-transporting materials may be used alone to form a film or may be used being mixed together in two or more kinds to form a film. Or the above compounds may be used in one kind or in a plurality of kinds to form a plurality of layers, and a multiplicity of films formed by laminating such layers may be used as a hole-transporting layer. In forming the hole-transporting layer 3 (the same also holds for the hole injection layer, too), the material usually used for forming the layer may, further, be P-doped with a trisbromophenylaminehexachloroantimony or the like. It is also allowable to form the hole-transporting layer 3 (or the hole injection layer) by using a high molecular compound having a basic skeleton of TPD. Further, as the electron-blocking layer (that can be formed between the luminous layer 4 and the hole-transporting layer 3) that has not been shown, there can be used a known compound having the electron-blocking action, such as carbazole derivative or a compound that has a triphenylsilyl group yet having a triarylamine structure.

When a current is flown at a density of 10 mA/cm2, further, the brightness and luminous efficiency are all improved. Moreover, Examples 23 to 33 all show power efficiencies of from 5.23 to 7.87 lm/W which are great improvements over 4.19 lm/W of Comparative Example 1. It will, therefore, be learned that the organic EL device of the present invention features excellent luminous efficiency and power efficiency as compared to the device that uses the compound 118 of the above general formula that is a widely employed electron-transporting material, and is capable of achieving a conspicuous decrease in the practical driving voltage. From a conspicuous decrease in the driving voltage attained by the organic EL device using the benzotriazole derivative of the present invention that has a benzotriazole ring structure and a pyridine structure, it is presumed that the rate of electron migration in the benzotriazole derivative is very larger than that of the compound 118 of the above structural formula that is a widely used electron-transporting material. INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY The benzotriazole derivative of the present invention has good electron injection property and excellent hole-blocking power, remains stable in its thin film state, and can be used as an excellent compound for fabricating the organic EL devices. Upon fabricating the organic EL devices by using the above compound, further, it is allowed to attain a high luminous efficiency and power efficiency while lowering the practical driving voltage and improving the durability. Its use can, therefore, be expanded to, for example, domestic appliances and illumination equipment.
