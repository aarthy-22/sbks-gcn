BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE 1. Field of the Disclosure The present disclosure relates to a glass manufacturing technique, and more particularly, to a method for forming a lubricant layer on the surface of a glass and a method for manufacturing a glass using the same, which may prevent scratches from occurring at the surface of a glass and decrease corrosion of glass manufacturing equipment. 2. Description of the Related Art Many kinds of flat glasses are being used in various fields like window panes, window screens of vehicles and mirrors. Such a flat glass may be manufactured in various ways. Among them, a representative method is a production method using a float method. For example, thin glass planes or glass films for TFT displays are frequently manufactured by the float method. The glass manufactured by the float method is called a float glass. FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram showing a system for manufacturing a float glass. As shown in FIG. 1, a float glass is generally formed by using a float bath 10 where a molten metal M such as molten tin or molten tin alloy is stored and flows. At this time, a molten glass having a lower viscosity than the molten metal M and lighter than the molten metal M by about ⅔ is successively supplied into the float bath 10 through an inlet of the float bath 10. The molten glass moves to the downstream of the float bath 10 while floating and spreading on the molten metal M. In this process, the molten glass nearly reaches an equivalent thickness according to its surface tension and gravity to form a glass strip or ribbon which is solidified to some extent. In addition, the molten glass ribbon formed as above is transferred from the float bath 10 to an annealing furnace 20 and experiences an annealing process. In the annealing process, the glass is transferred from an inlet to an outlet of the annealing furnace 20 by transfer means such as a roller 30 or a belt. In addition, after the annealing process, the glass may also be carried by the transfer means such as the roller 30. While the glass is transferred in the annealing process or after the annealing process, the lower surface of the glass may come into contact with the transfer means such as the roller 30. At this time, due to the transfer means such as the roller 30, flows, cracks or scratches may occur at the lower surface of the glass. Particularly, if the above equipment is used continuously, impurities or glass fractures may be attached to the transfer means such as the roller 30. In this case, scratches may occur more easily at the lower surface of the glass. If scratches occur at the lower surface of the glass during a glass transferring process using the roller 30 or the lime, the quality and yield of glass greatly deteriorate. Therefore, efforts are being made to prevent scratches from occurring at the lower surface of a glass during the glass transferring process, particularly in the annealing furnace 20, or during a process of transferring a glass after the annealing process. Among them, a representative technique is to supply SO2 gas to the lower surface of a glass at an initial stage of the glass annealing process or before the glass annealing process. If the SO2 gas is sprayed to the lower surface of a glass as described above, the SO2 gas reacts with alkali components of the glass, particularly sodium components, to form sulphate such as Na2SO4. In addition, the formed sulphate serves as a lubricant layer since its film strength is higher than that of a glass, thereby preventing scratches from occurring at the lower surface of the glass by the transfer means such as the roller 30 and improving the scratch resistance of the glass. However, in case of a non-alkali glass substantially not containing an alkali component such as sodium, like a glass for LCD, even though SO2 gas is supplied, a sulphate lubricant layer is not easily formed by an alkali metal such as Na2SO4. The SO2 gas should react with components such as alkali earth metal like calcium in the glass to form a sulphate lubricant layer such as CaSO4, but the SO2 gas does not easily react with alkali earth metals or the like in comparison to alkali metals such as sodium. Therefore, in order to form a lubricant layer such as CaSO4, an excessive amount of SO2 gas should be used. However, if a lot of SO2 gas is used, the production cost may increase accordingly. In addition, the toxicity of the SO2 gas may act as a source of environmental pollution and cause serious harm to workers health. Moreover, since manufacturing equipment or instruments such as the annealing furnace 20 may be easily corroded due to SO2 gas, the productivity and process efficiency when manufacturing glasses may be adversely affected. For this reason, the SO2 gas should be used as little as possible. However, in the conventional technique, an excessive amount of SO2 gas should be inevitably used to form a lubricant layer for preventing scratches from occurring at the lower surface of a glass. SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE Technical Problem The present disclosure is designed to solve the problems of the prior art, and therefore it is an object of the present disclosure to provide an apparatus for forming a lubricant layer on the surface of a glass, which may use a small amount of SO2 gas and effectively prevent scratches from occurring at the surface of the glass; and a method for manufacturing a glass using the same. Other objects and advantages of the present disclosure will be understood by the following description and become more apparent from the embodiments of the present disclosure, which are set forth herein. It will also be apparent that objects and advantages of the present disclosure can be embodied easily by the means defined in claims and combinations thereof. Technical Solution In order to accomplish the above object, the present disclosure provides a method for manufacturing a glass, which includes forming a glass; supplying SO2 gas and a SO2 gas oxidation catalyst to the glass under an oxidation environment to form a lubricant layer at the lower surface of the glass; and annealing the glass. Preferably, the SO2 gas is oxidized into SO3 gas under the oxidation environment. Also preferably, the SO2 gas oxidation catalyst includes V2O5. Also preferably, the lubricant layer formed in the lubricant layer forming process includes CaSO4. In addition, in order to accomplish the above object, the present disclosure provides a glass, which is manufactured by the above method for manufacturing a glass. In addition, in order to accomplish the above object, the present disclosure provides a method for forming a lubricant layer on the surface of a glass by using SO2 gas, wherein the SO2 gas is supplied to the glass together with a SO2 gas oxidation catalyst under an oxidation environment. Preferably, the SO2 gas is oxidized into SO3 gas under the oxidation environment. Also preferably, the SO2 gas oxidation catalyst includes V2O5. Also preferably, the lubricant layer includes CaSO4. In addition, in order to accomplish the above object, the present disclosure provides an apparatus for manufacturing a glass, which includes: a glass forming unit for forming a glass; a SO2 supply unit for supplying SO2 gas to the formed glass; an O2 supply unit for supplying O2 gas to the formed glass; and a catalyst supply unit for supplying a SO2 gas oxidation catalyst with respect to the SO2 gas supplied to the glass. Advantageous Effects According to the present disclosure, since a lubricant layer is easily formed at the surface of a glass, particularly the lower surface of the glass which directly contacts a roller or the like, the scratch resistance of the glass may be improved. Therefore, when the glass is transferred by the transfer means such as a roller and a belt during a manufacturing process such as a glass annealing process, it is possible to effectively prevent flaws, cracks or scratches from occurring at the lower surface of the glass. Therefore, a defect rate may be lowered during the glass manufacturing process and a high-quality glass may be obtained. In addition, since scratches at the glass decrease, time and costs required for polishing the glass may be reduced. Further, according to the present disclosure, a sulphate lubricant layer may be sufficiently formed at the surface of a glass by using a small amount of SO2 gas. Therefore, it is possible to suppress SO2 gas with strong toxicity causing environmental pollution and bringing harmful working conditions to a worker. In addition, the SO2 gas may be more simply purchased and treated at low costs. Moreover, it is possible to suppress that glass manufacturing equipment or instruments such as an annealing furnace from being corroded by the SO2 gas, which may extend the life span of the glass manufacturing equipment or instruments. Particularly, in case of a non-alkali glass substantially not containing an alkali metal such as sodium, like a glass for LCD, a sulphate lubricant layer may be sufficiently formed by using a relatively small amount of SO2 gas. In addition, since the time required for forming the sulphate lubricant layer is shortened, the time required for the entire glass manufacturing process may be shortened and the production cost may be reduced.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Prior to the description, it should be understood that the terms used in the specification and the appended claims should not be construed as limited to general and dictionary meanings, but interpreted based on the meanings and concepts corresponding to technical aspects of the present disclosure on the basis of the principle that the inventor is allowed to define terms appropriately for the best explanation. Therefore, the description proposed herein is just a preferable example for the purpose of illustrations only, not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure, so it should be understood that other equivalents and modifications could be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure. FIG. 2 is a flowchart for schematically illustrating a method for manufacturing a glass according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. Referring to FIG. 2, a glass is firstly formed by using a molten glass to make a glass according to the present disclosure (S110). The glass forming process S110 may be performed in various ways, and the present disclosure is not limited to a specific glass forming manner. Preferably, the glass forming process S110 may be performed by means of a float method. In other words, as shown in FIG. 1, a molten glass is supplied to a float bath 10 storing a molten metal M and floated and spread on the metal M to form a glass. At this time, the thickness of a glass ribbon may be changed by adjusting the amount of glass put through an inlet of the float bath 10 or by controlling forming means such as top rollers 30 installed in the float bath 10. The glass forming process using such a float method is well known in the art and is not described in detail here. The float glass manufacturing method includes cyclic successive processes and may operate constantly without a cessation, which allows flat glasses to be manufactured for several years without a pause. This is very suitable for glass forming. In addition, various glass forming methods well known in the art at the filing of the present disclosure may be adopted in the glass forming process S110 of the present disclosure. If a glass is formed from a molten glass as described above, the glass is annealed (S130). The method for manufacturing a glass according to the present disclosure performs forming a lubricant layer at the lower surface of the glass (S120) before performing the glass annealing process S130. Here, ‘before performing the glass annealing process S130’ means the moment before the glass annealing process S130 is entirely completed, which includes the moment before the glass annealing process S130 is initiated as well as the moment the glass annealing process S130 is proceeding but not yet completed. For example, the lubricant layer forming process S120 may be performed at an early stage of the glass annealing process S130. In the lubricant layer forming process S120, the method for manufacturing a glass according to the present disclosure supplies SO2 gas and SO2 gas oxidation catalyst to the glass under an oxidation environment in order to form a lubricant layer at the lower surface of the glass. The SO2 gas reacts with some components of the glass to generate sulphate so that a lubricant layer may be formed at the lower surface of the glass by the sulphate. Particularly, in case of a non-alkali glass, the SO2 gas supplied in the lubricant layer forming process S120 may react with a component such as calcium contained in the glass to form a sulphate lubricant layer. [in-line-formulae]SO2(g)+½×O2(g)→SO3(g) Formula 1[/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae]SO3(g)+CaO(s)→CaSO4(s) Formula 2[/in-line-formulae] In other words, the SO2 gas, supplied under an oxidation environment where oxygen is present, reacts with oxygen and is oxidized into SO3 gas, as shown in Formula 1. In addition, the SO3 gas generated as above reacts with calcium oxide contained in the glass to form CaSO4 so that a lubricant layer is formed at the surface of the glass. Even though Formula 2 shows only the process where SO2 gas reacts with CaO in the glass to form a CaSO4 lubricant layer, the SO2 gas may also react with another component of the glass to form a lubricant layer by another kind of sulphate. For example, the SO2 gas may react with MgO or Cr2O3 of the glass to form a sulphate lubricant layer such as MgSO4 and Cr2 (SO4)3. Since the SO2 gas supplied to the glass as described above reacts with a certain component of the glass and forms a lubricant layer at the surface by sulphate, it is possible to prevent flaws, cracks or scratches from occurring at the surface of the glass. Particularly, the method for manufacturing a glass according to the present disclosure supplies the SO2 gas oxidation catalyst together with the SO2 gas. Here, the SO2 gas oxidation catalyst represents a catalyst which may promote a chemical reaction of Formula 1 where SO2 gas is oxidized into SO3 gas. Preferably, the SO2 gas oxidation catalyst may include V2O5. In a case where V2O5, namely vanadium pentoxide, is added together with SO2 gas, the oxidation reaction of the SO2 gas into SO3 gas is promoted. In addition, as SO2 gas is oxidized into SO3 gas more and more, the reaction for forming CaSO4 by the SO3 gas as in Formula 2 may be actively performed. Therefore, the lubricant layer of CaSO4 may be sufficiently formed by using just a small amount of SO2 gas. Since V2O5 has good resistance against catalyst inactivation of SO2 gas catalyst, V2O5 is preferred as a SO2 gas oxidation catalyst in the present disclosure. When V2O5 is supplied as a SO2 gas oxidation catalyst together with SO2 gas, V2O5 may be supplied in various states and forms. For example, V2O5 may be supplied in the form of powder. In a case where V2O5 is supplied in the form of powder, the reaction area increases and the oxidation reaction of the SO2 gas in Formula 1 may be performed more actively. However, the present disclosure is not limited to a specific form or state of V2O5. For example, V2O5 may be heated over a melting point and then sprayed. In addition, various catalysts may be used as the SO2 gas oxidation catalyst in addition to V2O5. For example, Fe2O3, CuO, TiO2, Cr2O3, SiO2, CaO, Al2O3 or WO3 may be used as the SO2 gas oxidation catalyst, and at least two of them may be combined and used. As described above, the SO2 gas oxidation catalyst is not limited to a specific kind of material if it can promote oxidation of SO2 gas into SO3 gas. In addition, the SO2 gas oxidation catalyst may be used together with another material which enhances activation of the catalyst. For example, V2O5 may be used together with K2O, K2SO4, K2S2O7 or the like, which enhances the catalyst activation of V2O5. As described above, according to the present disclosure, since the SO2 gas oxidation catalyst is supplied together with the SO2 gas, the SO2 gas is actively oxidized and so a lubricant layer is sufficiently formed by sulphate. Particularly, in case of a non-alkali glass substantially not containing alkali ions such as sodium, a lubricant layer is not easily formed in comparison to an alkali glass. However, according to the present disclosure, since the SO2 gas oxidation catalyst may promote the oxidation reaction of the SO2 gas as in Formula 1, in a non-alkali glass, a lubricant layer may be rapidly and sufficiently formed by means of sulphate by using a small amount of SO2 gas. However, even though the above embodiments have been illustrated based on the case where the present disclosure is applied to a non-alkali glass, it does not mean that the present disclosure must be applied to a non-alkali glass. In other words, the present disclosure may also be applied to an alkali glass, and in case of an alkali glass, the formation of alkali metal sulphate such as Na2SO4 may be further promoted. Therefore, in this case, a lubricant layer may also be sufficiently formed by using a small amount of SO2 gas. Meanwhile, in the lubricant layer forming process S120, the SO2 gas and the SO2 gas oxidation catalyst are preferably supplied in the range of ±100° C. from a transition temperature of the glass. The reaction between SO2 gas and a glass is actively performed within 100° C. below or above the transition temperature of the glass. For example, since a glass for LCD has a transition temperature of about 750° C., the SO2 gas and the SO2 gas oxidation catalyst may be supplied under a temperature environment of about 650 to 850° C. In addition, under the oxidation environment where SO2 gas may be oxidized, moisture or air may be further supplied together with oxygen. In other words, the oxygen used for oxidizing SO2 gas may be supplied in various ways so that the oxidation of SO2 gas may be activated. The glass annealing process S130 may be performed by using an annealing furnace 20, and the SO2 gas and the SO2 gas oxidation catalyst may be supplied in the annealing furnace 20. FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram showing an example where SO2 gas and SO2 gas oxidation catalyst are supplied to a glass in the annealing furnace 20 in order to form a lubricant layer at the lower surface of the glass according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. Referring to FIG. 3, the glass formed in the forming process is introduced though an inlet 21 of the annealing furnace. At this time, the temperature of the inlet 21 of the annealing furnace may be about 700 to 800° C. In addition, the glass introduced into the annealing furnace 20 as described above is annealed while being transferred toward an outlet 22 of the annealing furnace of about 200 to 300° C. by at least one roller 30 provided at the annealing furnace 20. Particularly, according to the embodiment of FIG. 3, V2O5 serving as the SO2 gas oxidation catalyst is supplied at the inlet 21 of the annealing furnace together with SO2 gas and O2 gas. Therefore, V2O5 promotes the oxidation reaction of SO2 gas into SO3 gas, and the SO3 gas may promote the formation of sulphate at the lower surface of the glass. Therefore, according to this embodiment, since the lubricant layer is sufficiently formed at the lower surface of the glass by sulphate, even though the lower surface of the glass comes into contact with the roller 30 located in the annealing furnace 20 or the roller 30 provided after the annealing furnace 20, the sufficiently formed lubricant layer may suppress the formation of scratches at the lower surface of the glass. Meanwhile, even though the embodiment of FIG. 3 has been illustrated as the SO2 gas and the SO2 gas oxidation catalyst are supplied near the inlet 21 of the annealing furnace, namely at an early stage of the annealing process, it is just an example, and the SO2 gas and the SO2 gas oxidation catalyst may be supplied in various forms and ways. For example, the SO2 gas and the SO2 gas oxidation catalyst may be supplied before the glass is introduced to a middle portion of the annealing furnace 20 or to the inside of the annealing furnace 20. In addition, even though the embodiment of FIG. 3 has been illustrated as O2 gas is directly supplied to form an oxidation environment of the SO2 gas, it is also possible to supply air containing O2 gas. The glass according to the present disclosure is a glass prepared according to the above glass manufacturing method. Meanwhile, even though the above embodiment illustrates a lubricant layer forming at the lower surface of a glass in order to prevent scratches from occurring at the lower surface while the glass is being transferred by transfer means such as the roller 30 during or after the glass annealing process, the lubricant layer may also be formed at various processes of the glass manufacturing method other than the glass annealing process. In other words, if cracks or scratches may occur at the surface of a glass, SO2 gas and SO2 gas oxidation catalyst may be supplied at any process, without being limited to the time before or after the glass annealing process, to promote the formation of a sulphate lubricant layer at the surface of the glass. Hereinafter, the present disclosure will be described in more detail based on examples and comparative examples. The embodiments of the present disclosure, however, may take several other forms, and the scope of the present disclosure should not be construed as being limited to the following examples. The embodiments of the present disclosure are provided to more fully explain the present disclosure to those having ordinary knowledge in the art to which the present disclosure pertains. First, the examples and the comparative examples will be compared to look into the effect of promoting the formation of a sulphate lubricant layer at the surface of a glass and preventing scratches from occurring, in a case where a SO2 gas oxidation catalyst is supplied together with SO2 gas to form a lubricant layer on at least one surface of the glass as in the present disclosure. Examples 1 to 3 FIG. 4 is a schematic diagram showing a device for supplying SO2 gas and an SO2 gas oxidation catalyst to a glass plate to cause an oxidation reaction of the SO2 gas at the surface of the glass plate according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. As Examples 1 to 3 according to the present disclosure, as shown in FIG. 4, a glass plate for LCD with a size of 15×15 mm was prepared and sealed with an O-ring. After that, the glass plate was put into a quartz tube furnace 40 of 650° C. (Example 1), 700° C. (Example 2) and 750° C. (Example 3), and SO2 gas and O2 gas were supplied thereto to make an environment of SO2 5%, O2 10%. In addition, V2O5 powder was placed on the supply path of the SO2 gas and the O2 gas so that the V2O5 powder was supplied to the glass plate as a SO2 gas oxidation catalyst. In addition, this state was maintained for 60 minutes so that the reactions of Formulas 1 and 2 occur in the tube furnace 40. And then, the tube furnace 40 of each example was sufficiently cooled and all reaction gases were exhausted out of the tube furnace 40 by using nitrogen gas. After that, the IC (Ion Chromatography) analysis was performed to the glass plates of Examples 1 to 3, respectively, and the number of scratches was measured by using the Taber manner. The analysis results are shown in Table 1 below. Here, the IC analysis is an analysis method for comparing the degree of CaSO4 formed at the surface of the glass plate as a lubricant layer. For the IC analysis, each glass plate was put into 10 mg DI water and maintained at 60° C. for 10 minutes so that CaSO4 at the surface of the glass plate is dissolved in the DI water, and the IC analysis was performed to the solution. At this time, the dissolution of CaSO4 was checked by performing an ESCA analysis before or after the IC analysis. In addition, the measurement of the number of scratches using the Taber manner is an analysis method for checking scratch resistance at the surface of the glass plate. The number of scratches of each glass plate was measured according to the method shown in FIG. 5. FIG. 5 is a schematic diagram showing a configuration for measuring the scratch resistance of a glass plate in a Taber manner. As shown in FIG. 5, the glass plates of Examples 1 to 3 were placed on a plate and rotated. At this time, two abrading wheels 50 rotate in opposite directions at the upper portion of the glass plate to cause scratches at the glass plate. Here, the abrading wheel 50 employs a 500 g wheel and the number of rotation was set to 10. After that, each glass plate was washed, and then the number of scratches occurring within internal 12×12 mm of each glass plate was measured by using an optical microscope. Comparative Examples 1 to 6 As Comparative Examples 1 to 3 to be compared with Examples 1 to 3, a glass plate for LCD with a size of 15×15 mm was sealed with an O-ring and then put into a tube furnace 40 of 650° C. (Comparative Example 1), 700° C. (Comparative Example 2) and 750° C. (Comparative Example 3), and SO2 gas and O2 gas were supplied thereto to make an environment of SO2 5%, O2 10%, similar to Examples 1 to 3. However, V2O5 powder was not supplied, different from Examples 1 to 3. In addition, this state was maintained for 60 minutes so that the reactions of Formulas 1 and 2 occur. After the glass plates of Comparative Examples 1 to 3 were reacted in the tube furnace 40 of each condition, the tube furnace 40 was cooled and all reaction gases were exhausted out of the tube furnace 40 by using nitrogen gas. In addition, as Comparative Examples 4 to 6 to be compared with Examples 1 to 3, a glass plate for LCD with a size of 15×15 mm was sealed with an O-ring and then put into a tube furnace 40 of 650° C. (Comparative Example 4), 700° C. (Comparative Example 5) and 750° C. (Comparative Example 6), and SO2 gas and O2 gas were supplied thereto to make an environment of SO2 5%, O2 10%, similar to Examples 1 to 3. However, V2O5 powder was not supplied, different from Examples 1 to 3, and moisture (H2O) was supplied to the glass plate by using a bubbler. In addition, this state was maintained for the glass plate to react for 60 minutes. After the glass plates of Comparative Examples 4 to 6 were reacted for 60 minutes in the tube furnace 40 of each condition, the tube furnace 40 was cooled and all reaction gases were exhausted out of the tube furnace 40 by using nitrogen gas. After that, the IC analysis was performed to the glass plates of Comparative Examples 1 to 6, similar to Examples 1 to 3, and the number of scratches was measured in the Taber manner. The analysis and measurement results are shown in Table 1 below. TABLE 1 SO2 O2 Reaction Temp. IC analysis Number of (%) (%) time (min) (° C.) H2O V2O5 (ppm) scratches Example 1 5 10 60 650 X Used 2.8 119 Example 2 700 X Used 5.2 80 Example 3 750 X Used 8.7 80 Comparative 650 X X 0.3 148 Example 1 Comparative 700 X X 0.6 130 Example 2 Comparative 750 X X 1.1 138 Example 3 Comparative 650 Used X 0.9 134 Example 4 Comparative 700 Used X 1.4 139 Example 5 Comparative 750 Used X 2.4 110 Example 6 If the IC analysis results are considered in Table 1, in case of Examples 1 to 3 using V2O5 as a SO2 gas oxidation catalyst, the IC analysis was measured as 2.8 to 8.7 ppm (5.6 ppm on average). However, in Comparative Examples 1 to 3 not using both H2O and V2O5, the IC analysis was measured as 0.3 to 1.1 ppm (0.7 ppm on average), and in Comparative Examples 4 to 6 using H2O and not using V2O5, the IC analysis was measured as 0.9 to 2.4 ppm (1.6 ppm on average). From these results, it could be understood that CaSO4 serving as a lubricant layer is formed much more on the surface of the glass plate in the case where V2O5 serving as an oxidation catalyst is used together with SO2 gas. In addition, if the measurement results about the number of scratches are considered in Table 1, in case of Examples 1 to 3, the number of scratches occurring at the surface of a glass was 93 on average. However, in Comparative Examples 1 to 3, the number of scratches was 138.7 on average, and in Comparative Examples 4 to 6, the number of scratches was 127.7 on average. Therefore, it could be understood that much more scratches occur at the surface of the glass plates according to the comparative examples. Particularly, in case of Comparative Examples 4 to 6 using H2O instead of V2O5, even though the number of scratches is somewhat smaller than that of Comparative Examples 1 to 3 not using both V2O5 and H2O, but its effect is not so great in comparison to Examples 1 to 3. When looking at the IC analysis results and the measurement results of the number of scratches using the Taber manner, it could be understood that, in a case where V2O5 serving as a SO2 gas oxidation catalyst is supplied together with SO2 gas, CaSO4 serving as a lubricant layer may be more sufficiently formed at the surface of the glass plate, and so the scratch resistance at the surface of the glass plate may be remarkably improved. Therefore, the present disclosure may effectively reduce the formation of scratches at the surface of the glass plate. Hereinafter, the improvement of the effect obtained by the formation of a CaSO4 layer according to the present disclosure will be examined in another way. In other words, with respect to the glass plate of Example 3 in Table 1 and the glass plates of Comparative Examples 3 and 6, the amount and thickness of a CaSO4 layer formed at the surface of each glass plate will be measured and compared. Here, the amount of the CaSO4 layer formed at the surface of each glass plate is obtained by measuring weight % of Ca and S by means of ESCA (EQC-0124). In addition, the thickness of the CaSO4 layer formed at the surface of each glass plate may be determined by etching the surface of the glass plate by means of Ar ion beam and judging the presence of S up to the depth of 50 nm. In addition, the measurement results are shown in FIGS. 6 and 7. FIG. 6 is a graph showing measurement results of Ca and S contents at each depth of the glass plate according to an example of the present disclosure and a comparative example, and FIG. 7 is a table which expresses the graph of FIG. 6 with numerals. Referring to FIGS. 6 and 7, in case of the glass plate of Example 3 according to the present disclosure, the S concentration at the surface reached about 10 wt %, but in case of the glass plates of Comparative Examples 3 and 6, the S concentration at the surface was just about 5 wt %. In addition, regarding the Ca concentration, in case of the glass plate of Example 3, the surface concentration reached about 7 wt %, but in case of the glass plates of Comparative Examples 3 and 6, the surface concentration was just about 3-4 wt %. Particularly, considering that, in case of Example 3, S was found up to the depth of about 40 nm from the surface of the glass plate, the CaSO4 layer may be estimated as having a thickness of about 40 nm. However, in case of Comparative Example 3, S was found up to the depth of about 5 nm from the surface of the glass plate, and thus the CaSO4 layer may be estimated as having a thickness of about 5 nm. In addition, in case of Comparative Example 6, S was found up to the depth of about 10 nm, and thus the CaSO4 layer may be estimated as having a thickness of about 10 nm. Therefore, it could be understood that the CaSO4 layer formed at the glass plate of Example 3 according to the present disclosure is much thicker than that of the glass plate of Comparative Examples 3 and 6. Moreover, considering the depth up to about 5 nm from the surface of the glass plate, in case of the glass plate of Example 3, the S concentration was about 10 wt %, but in case of the glass plates of Comparative Examples 3 and 6, the S concentration was just about 3 wt %. From the results, it could be understood that the CaSO4 layer formed at the surface of the glass plate according to the present disclosure is much thicker and richer. Meanwhile, the method for manufacturing a glass as described above may be performed by an apparatus for manufacturing a glass according to the present disclosure. FIG. 8 is a block diagram schematically showing a functional configuration of the apparatus for manufacturing a glass according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. Referring to FIG. 8, the apparatus for manufacturing a glass according to the present disclosure includes a glass forming unit 100, a SO2 supply unit 200, an O2 supply unit 300 and a catalyst supply unit 400. The glass forming unit 100 forms a glass. In case of a float glass, the glass forming unit 100 may be configured to include a float bath. The SO2 supply unit 200 supplies SO2 gas to the surface of a glass formed by the glass forming unit 100 such as a float bath. Preferably, in a case where a formed glass is introduced into an annealing furnace, the SO2 supply unit 200 supplies SO2 gas into the annealing furnace, so that the SO2 gas is supplied to the surface of the glass. The O2 supply unit 300 supplies O2 gas to the glass formed by a float bath or the like, so that an oxidation environment is formed around the glass. Therefore, the SO2 gas supplied by the SO2 supply unit 200 may be oxidized into SO3 gas due to the oxidation environment. Here, the O2 supply unit 300 may supply pure O2 gas and may also supply another gas together with the O2 gas. For example, the O2 supply unit 300 may supply air to form an oxidation environment around the glass. The catalyst supply unit 400 supplies a SO2 gas oxidation catalyst with respect to the SO2 gas supplied to the glass. In other words, when the SO2 gas is supplied to the glass by the SO2 supply unit 200, the catalyst supply unit 400 provides an oxidation catalyst for the SO2 gas so that the SO2 gas may be easily oxidized into SO3 gas. Preferably, the catalyst supply unit 400 may supply at least one of V2O5, Fe2O3, CuO, TiO2, Cr2O3, SiO2, CaO, Al2O3 and WO3 as the SO2 gas oxidation catalyst. At this time, the catalyst supply unit 400 may further supply at least one of K2O, K2SO4 and K2S2O7 together with the SO2 gas oxidation catalyst. The present disclosure has been described in detail.
