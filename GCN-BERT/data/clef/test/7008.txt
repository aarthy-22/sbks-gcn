ELASTICALLY DEFORMABLE POLYMER ARTICLES AND METHODS OF USE FOR ABSORBING CYCLIC PRESSURE EXCURSIONS BACKGROUND [0001] This invention relates to articles and methods for mitigating cyclic pressure changes in a system, in particular elastically deformable polymer particles that can mitigate cyclic pressure changes in piping systems. [0002] A number of engineering systems that include piping to provide fluid communication between system elements are subject to pressure fluctuations in the piping during operation, for example manufacturing operations, recycling or purification operations such as wastewater operations, and drilling operations. Such pressure fluctuations can cause stress to the systems, eventually resulting in mechanical failure of the system. For example, in drilling operations, a piping system can be used to provide a fluid connection between a deposited resource and an above ground storage or distribution system. The internal pipe is generally isolated from the adjacent subterranean formations by a casing, providing an annulus. Fluid pressure within the annulus can fluctuate, resulting in cyclic pressure excursions. Left unmitigated, such pressure excursions can damage equipment or cause a rupture in the piping system. Any damage to the well can significantly affect drilling production, can add to production cost, or can lead to an environmental release of the fluid in the piping system. [0003] Thus there is a need in the art for effectively mitigating annular pressure buildup within piping systems that is capable of reducing the magnitude of cyclic pressure excursions. BRIEF DESCRIPTION [0004] An elastically deformable article of manufacture can comprise a closed polymer shell having an outer surface, an inner surface, and an inner volume; a reinforcement in mechanical communication with an area of either the outer surface, the inner surface, or both the outer surface and the inner surface; wherein the closed polymer shell comprises a first polymer material having a thermal decomposition temperature of greater than or equal to 180 °C; wherein the article is configured such that the inner volume reduces from an initial inner volume as a pressure applied to the outer surface is increased to a threshold pressure and rebounds to greater than 75% of the initial inner volume as the pressure decreases from the threshold pressure over at least two pressure cycles.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0014] Disclosed herein is an article of manufacture that can be used to mitigate pressure excursions, such as annular pressure buildup, in a piping system. The article can include a closed shell of a polymeric material. The closed polymer shell (or shell) can have an inner surface and an outer surface. The inner surface of the shell can have any shape. The outer surface of the shell can have any shape. A cross section of the inner or outer surface of a shell can have a circular shape, elliptical shape, triangular shape, square shape, polygonal shape (e.g. any closed polygon), or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing. The inner and outer surfaces of the shell can have the same shape. The shell thickness can be substantially uniform throughout the shell (e.g., allowing for slight variation during manufacturing due to tool imperfections, tool wear, local variation in polymer shrinkage or surface tension affects during shrinkage, and the like). The inner and outer surfaces of the shell can have different shapes. The shell thickness can vary throughout the shell. The shell thickness can have thicker and thinner areas as compared to the average thickness of the shell. The shell can have an irregular thickness, e.g., resulting from an extruded pellet including gas inclusions throughout where the shell can be a continuous portion of material that encloses an inner volume. [0015] The inner or outer surfaces of the shell can have any surface texture. The inner or outer surfaces can be smooth. The inner or outer surfaces can be dimpled. The inner or outer surfaces can be rough. [0016] A pressure gradient can form across the shell. Such a pressure gradient can form when a pressure along a surface of the shell changes more rapidly than the pressure on the opposing surface. The pressure gradient across the shell can act to deform the shape of the shell or change the inner volume of the shell. The outer surface of the shell can be subjected to a higher pressure than the inner surface of the shell. In this case, the shell can be compacted until the forces acting on the shell (or shell wall) equilibrate. The outer surface of the shell can be subjected to a lower pressure than the inner surface of the shell. In this case, the shell can expand until the forces acting on the shell equilibrate. [0017] A pressure cycle as used herein can refer to a process where a first pressure differential exists across the shell corresponding to an initial inner volume of the shell, the pressure differential across the shell then increases to a second pressure differential, the pressure differential across the shell then decreases to a third pressure differential. The third pressure differential, or the pressure differential acting across the shell at the completion of one pressure cycle, can be different than the first pressure differential. The third pressure differential can be greater than the first pressure differential. The third pressure differential can be equal to the first pressure differential. The third pressure differential can be less than the first pressure differential. The first, second, and third pressure differentials can each be the result of a higher pressure acting on the outer surface of the shell and a lower pressure acting on the inner surface of the shell. [0018] The article can include a reinforcement. The reinforcement can be employed to adjust the amount of compaction or expansion that an article undergoes during a pressure cycle. The reinforcement can counteract the pressure forces acting on the shell. The reinforcement can be used to tune the response of the article to a change in differential pressure across the shell, such as at what pressure differential an article begins to deform (onset of deformation), the extent of deformation, and the ability of the article to regain its original volume once the pressure differential is relaxed (rebound). The reinforcement can be in mechanical communication with a surface of the shell. The reinforcement can be in mechanical communication with the inner surface of the shell. The reinforcement can be in mechanical communication with the outer surface of the shell. The reinforcement can be in mechanical communication with both the inner and outer surfaces of the shell. The reinforcement can provide structural integrity to the shell such that the shell can elastically deform over a selected range of differential pressures acting across the shell. The reinforcement can prevent deformation along an area of the shell. The reinforcement can help prevent the shell from plastically deforming when subjected to a pressure differential across the shell such that it is able to regain its original shape or volume once the pressure differential is relaxed, e.g., at the completion of one or more pressure cycles. [0019] The reinforcement can act as a spring which can store energy as it is compressed and use the stored energy to rebound once the compressive force is removed. The reinforcement can act as a spring which can store energy as it is expanded and use the stored energy to rebound once the expansion force is removed. The reinforcement can enhance the elastic characteristic of the article, such that the elastic deformation region of the article's stress-strain curve is altered. The structure of the shell can include a compaction initiator which is designed such that the shell can consistently begin compacting at a desired pressure differential or in a desired manner. Once the pressure differential starts to decrease the article can begin to rebound to its original shape or original inner volume. Following one or more pressure cycles the inner volume of the article can return to greater than or equal to 50% of its initial volume, for example, 50% to 95%, or, 70% to 90%. [0020] The reinforcement can act to reduce the amount of deformation that an article will undergo until a predetermined pressure differential exists across the shell. At a predetermined pressure differential, or threshold pressure differential, the reinforcement can act to influence the deformation of the article as the pressure differential continues to increase. The threshold pressure differential can be selected for a specific application and articles of manufacture can be adjusted by various factors to meet the selected threshold pressure differential. Some factors that can influence the threshold pressure differential for an article include shell thickness, pressure of the inner volume, the material of the article, the strength of the article, and the shape of the article. These factors can influence the shape of the stress-strain curve of the article. The threshold pressure differential for an article can be selected from 345 kilopascals (kPa) to 105 megapascal (MPa), for example, 345 kPa to 75 MPa, or, 345 kPa to 50 MPa, or, 10 MPa to 25 MPa, and all pressure differentials between the ends of these ranges. [0021] FIG. 1 is an illustration of an article 2. The article 2 can include a closed polymer shell 4 including an outer surface 6, inner surface 8 and centerline 12. The distance between the outer surface 6 and the inner surface 8 can define the wall thickness 10 at any point along the closed polymer shell 4. The wall thickness 10 can be substantially the same throughout the shell (e.g., allowing for slight variation during manufacturing due to tool imperfections, tool wear, local variation in polymer shrinkage or surface tension affects during shrinkage, and the like). The article 2 can include a reinforcement 20. The reinforcement 20 can be in mechanical communication with the closed polymer shell 4. The reinforcement 20 can be a protrusion 16 extending from a first area 80 of the inner surface 8 to a second area 82 of the inner surface 8. A protrusion 16 that extends from a surface of the shell to another surface can be hollow and can form a hole, or aperture, through the closed polymer shell 4. A protrusion 16 can extend in any dimension of the closed polymer shell 4. The first area 80 and second area 82 of the inner surface 8 can be disposed on opposite sides of a centerline 12. The first area 80 can face the second area 82. The inner volume 14 of the closed polymer shell 4 can be defined by the volume enclosed by the inner surface 8 of the closed polymer shell 4 less the volume occupied by the reinforcement 20. The pressure within the inner volume 14 can be any pressure that the closed polymer shell 4 can contain. [0022] FIG. 2 is an illustration of an article 22. The article 22 can include a reinforcement 20. The reinforcement 20 can be in mechanical communication with the closed polymer shell 4. The reinforcement 20 can be formed by at least two protrusions (17, 18) each extending from the inner surface 8 of the closed polymer shell 4. A first protrusion 17 can extend from a first area 80 of the inner surface 8. A second protrusion 18 can extend from a second area 82 of the inner surface 8. The first area 80 and second area 82 can be disposed on opposite sides of a centerline 12. The first area 80 and second area 82 can face one another. The first protrusion 17 and the second protrusion 18 can have surfaces 44 which can have complementary shapes. The surfaces 44 can be spaced apart from one another to define a gap 40 and a gap width 46. The surfaces 44 of the protrusions (17, 18) can oppose deformation of the article 22 along at least one axis (y-axis in FIG. 2). In an embodiment, as a pressure applied to the outer surface 6 increases, the article 22 can begin to deform and protrusions (17, 18) can begin to move toward one another decreasing the gap width 46. As this pressure continues to increase the surfaces 44 can come into contact with one another (gap width 46 can be equal to zero) and can resist further deformation along at least one dimension (e.g., along the y-axis dimension). Once the protrusions (17, 18) abut one another they can resist further deformation of the closed polymer shell 4 at least at the areas (80, 82) from which the protrusions (16, 18) extend. The surfaces 44 can be shaped to engage one another such that when the surfaces 44 abut one another they resist movement in at least one additional dimension (e.g. resist movement along the x-axis dimension or z-axis dimension, such as slipping). The surfaces 44 can be shaped to urge movement of protrusions (17, 18) in a predetermined direction (e.g. x-axis or y-axis dimension) as a pressure applied to the outer surface 6 increases. For example, the surfaces 44 can have complimenting slopes such that a protrusion (17, 18) slips off another protrusion (17, 18) as the pressure applied to the outer surface 6 increases. The pressure within the inner volume 14 can be any pressure that the closed polymer shell 4 can contain. [0023] FIG. 3 is an illustration of an article 32. The article can include a closed polymer shell 4. The wall thickness 10 of the closed polymer shell can vary throughout the closed polymer shell 4. The closed polymer shell 4 can include a thicker region 100 and thinner region 102 in comparison to the average thickness of the closed polymer shell 4. The article 32 can include a reinforcement 20. The thicker region 100 of the closed polymer shell 4 can act as the reinforcement 20. The thinner region 102 of the closed polymer shell 4 can act as deformation initiators, which can be the first areas of the shell to deform as a pressure applied to the outer surface 6 of the closed polymer shell 4 increases. The pressure within the inner volume 14 can be any pressure that the closed polymer shell 4 can contain. [0024] FIG. 4 is an illustration of an article 42. The article 42 can include a closed polymer shell 4. The closed polymer shell 4 can include an inner volume 14. The inner volume 14 can include a second polymer material 26. The second polymer material 26 can be a polymer foam material. A polymer foam material can include the same polymer as the polymer of the closed polymer shell 4. A polymer foam material can include solid polymer material and gas inclusions 28. The solid polymer material can form a porous structure 24 adjacent to the gas inclusions 28, such as a closed or open cell foam structure. This porous structure can act as a reinforcement 20. The volume of the gas inclusions 28 can decrease as the pressure applied to the outer surface 6 increases. As the gas inclusion volume decreases the porous structure 24 can help control deformation of the article 42 and store energy like a spring, such that when the pressure applied to the outer surface 6 is reduced. The article can rebound back to its initial volume or shape. The gas of the gas inclusions 28 can include any gas. The pressure within the gas inclusions 28 can be any pressure that the closed polymer shell 4 can contain. The inner volume 14 can be filled with a second polymer material 26. The second polymer material 26 can abut the inner surface 8 of the closed polymer shell 4, such that the second polymer material 26 is in mechanical communication with the closed polymer shell 4. The second polymer material 26 can be free of gas inclusions 28; it can be a non-foamed polymer material. The second polymer material 26 can have a lower durometer hardness value than the durometer hardness value of the polymer of the closed polymer shell 4. The hardness value of a material can be determined using any standard testing method (e.g., ASTM D785, ISO 2039-1). [0025] FIG. 5 is an illustration of an article 52. The article 52 can include a closed polymer shell 4. The closed polymer shell can include a first segment 60 and a second segment 70. The first segment 60 can include a first peripheral flange 64. The second segment 70 can include a second peripheral flange 74. The first peripheral flange 64 and second peripheral flange 74 can include alignment features 66 such that the first peripheral flange 64 abuts the second peripheral flange 74 along more than one plane. The alignment features 66 on the peripheral flanges can engage one another. Alignment features 66 can help position two or more segments of a closed polymer shell 4 relative to one another such that they can be aligned and not off-centered from one another. The two segments can be joined along the peripheral flanges (64, 74) using any joining technique known in the art. The pressure within the inner volume 14 can be any pressure that the closed polymer shell 4 can contain. [0026] FIG. 6 is an illustration of an article 62. The article can include a closed polymer shell 4. The article can include a reinforcement 20. The reinforcement 20 can be in mechanical communication with the outer surface 6 of the closed polymer shell 4. The reinforcement 20 can include a rib 68. The rib can extend from the outer surface 6 of the closed polymer shell 4. The rib 60 can extend any distance along a portion of the outer surface 6. The rib can extend around the entire outer surface 6 of the closed polymer shell 4. The rib 68 can extend in any direction. Two or more ribs 68 can extend perpendicular to one another, such as in perpendicular planes. The rib 68 can be discontinuous around a closed polymer shell 4, such as segmented in portions along the closed polymer shell 4. The rib 68 can be segmented into sections and the sections can be coplanar. Sets of coplanar ribs can be disposed perpendicular to one another such as in perpendicular planes. Sets of coplanar ribs can be disposed in intersecting planes that are not perpendicular. The rib 68 can have a varying rib height 69. The rib height can be measured orthogonally from a tangent plane 67 which is tangent to the outer surface 6 of the closed polymer shell 4. The rib 68 can extend in a helix around a centerline 12 of the article 2, such as like threads of a screw. The thickness 71 of a rib 68 can vary as a function of the rib height 69. The rib 68 can be thicker at its base, where it attaches to the closed polymer shell 4. The rib 68 can have a constant thickness as a function of rib height 69. The pressure within the inner volume 14 can be any pressure that the closed polymer shell 4 can contain. [0027] FIG. 7 is an illustration of an article 72. The article can include a closed polymer shell 4 which surrounds gas inclusions 78. The article 72 can have any shape. The article 72 can be formed by an extrusion process. The gas inclusions 78 can be formed during an extrusion process. The gas inclusions 78 can include any gas. The inner volume of the article 72 can include gas inclusions 78. The pressure of the gas within the gas inclusions 78 can be any pressure that the closed polymer shell 4 can contain. The outer surface 6 of the closed polymer shell 4 can be irregular. Crater like, or bubble like, formations can be disposed at the outer surface 6. These formations can be due to gas inclusions 78 moving to the outer surface 6 during manufacturing of the article 72, e.g., while the closed polymer shell 4 is molten. [0028] The inner surface of a closed polymer shell can define the inner volume of the article. The initial inner volume of the article can be 1 cubic millimeter (mm ) to 10 cubic decimeters (dm 3 ), for example 10 mm 3 to 1 dm 3 , or, 10 mm 3 to 25 cubic centimeters (cm 3 ). The inner volume of the article can include any material. The inner volume of the article can include a fluid, e.g., air, inert gas. The inner volume of the article can be pressurized. [0029] The article can be capable of elastic deformation. In this way, the article can deform as a pressure applied to the outside surface of the article increases and return to its original shape as the pressure is reduced. [0030] The article can be configured to start elastically deforming at an initial pressure and continue to deform until it reaches a final pressure. The initial pressure can be and final pressure [0031] The inner volume of an article can include a material that has a specific gravity that is greater than the specific gravity of a fluid surrounding the article. In this case, the article can float, or rise, within the fluid. The inner volume of an article can include a material that has a specific gravity that is less than the specific gravity of a fluid surrounding the article. In this case, the article can sink, or fall, within the fluid. [0032] The article can be formed by injection molding, e.g., gas assist injection molding, two shot injection molding, and the like. The article can be formed by insert molding or co-molding. For example a second polymer can be placed into a mold and a closed polymer shell can be molded over the second polymer. The closed polymer shell of the article can be thermoformed, vacuum formed or forming in a similar fashion. [0033] Besides being made by injection molding and other molding or forming processes, these elastically deformable articles of manufacture may be made by any suitable additive manufacturing processes including stereolithography, fused deposition modeling, selective laser sintering and 3D printing processes. [0034] A closed polymer shell can be formed in segments and the segments joined together. Segments of a closed polymer shell can include a peripheral flange extending from the periphery, or edge, of a segment of a closed polymer shell. Two or more segments can be joined along a peripheral flange to form a closed polymer shell. A flange can include alignment features which can aid in aligning segments, such that the segments are not off- centered or misaligned from one another when the segments are brought together or joined. Alignment features of a first peripheral flange can be shaped complementary to alignment features of another peripheral flange. Alignment features can include complementary protrusion and recess, threads, and the like, where the peripheral flange surfaces of two or more segments can abut one another along more than one plane. Joining segments together can include any mechanical, thermal, or chemical joining technique. For example joining can include hot plate welding, laser welding, rotary welding, thermal welding, ultrasonic welding, vibration welding, solvent bonding, melt bonding, adhesive bonding, or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing. [0035] The articles as disclosed herein can be used in a piping system to mitigate annular pressure buildup or other pressure excursions, such as cyclic pressure excursions, within the system. The articles can be mixed with a fluid used in the piping system, for example a reactant, as solvent, a wastewater or other fluid to be recycled, or a well bore fluid or other fluid commonly used in manufacturing, purification, or drilling operations. The fluid can be introduced to a piping system. The fluid can be pumped into a pipe, an annular space or any volume where a pressure excursion can be expected. The piping system can include a pipe and a surrounding barrier forming an annulus between the pipe and the barrier. The piping system can include a first pipe and a surrounding second pipe forming an annulus between the first pipe and the second pipe. The piping system can include a plug or other barrier capable of preventing mass flow axially through the annulus or pipe. The pipe or annulus can form a closed system. The system can be a pseudo-closed system such that the system can permit some transfer of mass or energy to adjacent barriers, annuli, fluids, pipes, or other adjacent equipment, but such transfer can be insufficient in reducing a pressure excursion or pressure buildup that is capable of causing cracks or rupture of barriers, pipes, plugs or other equipment to relieve the pressure excursion or pressure buildup. The pressure in the piping annulus can increase due to thermal energy transfer from adjacent pipes, e.g., coaxial pipes. The piping systems can include retainers that are capable of retaining the articles of manufacture within a predetermined volume pipe or annulus. [0036] The article can include a polymer. The polymer can be a thermoplastic polymer. The thermoplastic polymer can be generally considered a high temperature, hydrolytically and chemically stable polymer. The thermoplastic polymer can have a thermal decomposition temperature of 180°C or higher, for example, 200°C or higher, or, 220°C or higher, or, 250°C or higher. There is no particular upper limit to the thermal decomposition temperature, although 400°C can be mentioned. The polymer can be hydrolytically stable at high temperatures, for example, 180°C or higher, or, 200°C or higher, or, 220°C or higher, or, 250°C or higher. There is no particular upper limit temperature for the hydrolytic stability of the polymer, although 400°C can be mentioned. [0037] A thermoplastic polymer that can meet these conditions can contain aromatic groups, for example, polyamide (PA), polyphthalamides (PPA), aromatic polyimides, aromatic polyetherimides (PEI), polyphenylene sulfides (PPS), polyaryletherketones (PAEK), polyetherether ketones (PEEK), polyetherketoneketones (PEKK), polyethersulfones (PES), polyphenylenesulfones (PPSU), polyphenylenesulfone ureas, self-reinforced polyphenylene (SRP), or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing. The thermoplastic polymer can be a dendrimer. The thermoplastic polymer can be linear, or branched and can include a homopolymer or copolymer comprising units of two or more of the foregoing thermoplastic polymers, for example polyamide-imides (PAI). The copolymers can be random, alternating, graft, and block copolymers having two or more blocks of different homopolymers, random, or alternating copolymers. Specific high temperature polymers can be the aromatic polyetherimides available from SABIC under the trade name ULTEM. The high temperature thermoplastic polymers can be obtained and used in either pellet or powder form. [0038] Aromatic polyetherimides can include more than 1, for example 10 to 1000, or 10 to 500, structural units of formula (1) wherein each R can be the same or different, and can be a substituted or unsubstituted divalent organic group, such as a C6-2o aromatic hydrocarbon group or a halogenated derivative thereof, a straight or branched chain C2-20 alkylene group or a halogenated derivative thereof, a C3-8 cycloalkylene group or halogenated derivative thereof, in particular a divalent group of formula (2) wherein Q1 is -0-, -S-, -C(O)-, -SO2-, -SO-, or -CyH2y- wherein y is an integer from 1 to 5 or a halogenated derivative thereof (which includes perfluoroalkylene groups). In an embodiment R is a m-phenylene or p-phenylene. [0039] Further in formula (1), T is -O- or a group of the formula -0-Z-O- wherein the divalent bonds of the -O- or the -0-Z-O- group are in the 3,3', 3,4', 4,3', or the 4,4' positions. The group Z in -0-Z-O- of formula (1) is also a substituted or unsubstituted divalent organic group, and can be an aromatic C6-24 monocyclic or polycyclic moiety optionally substituted with 1 to 6 Ci_8 alkyl groups, 1 to 8 halogen atoms, or a combination thereof, provided that the valence of Z is not exceeded. Exemplary groups Z include groups derived from a dihydroxy compound of formul wherein Ra and Rb can be the same or different and are a halogen atom or a monovalent C1-6 alkyl group, for example; p and q are each independently integers of 0 to 4; c is 0 to 4; and X: is a bridging group connecting the hydroxy-substituted aromatic groups, where the bridging group and the hydroxy substituent of each C6 arylene group are disposed ortho, meta, or para (specifically para) to each other on the C6 arylene group. The bridging group Xa can be a single bond, -0-, -S-, -S(O)-, -S(0)2-, -C(O)-, or a C1-18 organic bridging group. The C1-18 organic bridging group can be cyclic or acyclic, aromatic or non-aromatic, and can further comprise heteroatoms such as halogens, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, silicon, or phosphorous. The C1-18 organic group can be disposed such that the C6 arylene groups connected thereto are each connected to a common alkylidene carbon or to different carbons of the C1-18 organic bridging group. A specific example of a group Z is a divalent group of formulas (3a) (3a) wherein Q is -0-, -S-, -C(0)-, -S02-, -SO-, or -CyH2y- wherein y is an integer from 1 to 5 or a halogenated derivative thereof (including a perfluoroalkylene group). In a specific embodiment Z is a derived from bisphenol A, such that Q in formula (3a) is 2,2- isopropylidene. [0040] In an embodiment in formula (1), R is m-phenylene or p-phenylene and T is - O-Z-0 wherein Z is a divalent group of formula (3 a). Alternatively, R is m-phenylene or p- phenylene and T is -O-Z-0 wherein Z is a divalent group of formula (3a) and Q is 2,2- isopropylidene. [0041] In some embodiments, the polyetherimide can be a copolymer, for example, a polyetherimide sulfone copolymer comprising structural units of formula (1) wherein at least 50 mole of the R groups are of formula (2) wherein Q1 is -S02- and the remaining R groups are independently p-phenylene or m-phenylene or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing; and Z is 2,2-(4-phenylene)isopropylidene. Alternatively, the polyetherimide optionally comprises additional structural imide units, for example imide units of formula (4): wherein R is as described in formula 1) and W is a linker of the formulas: These additional structural imide units can be present in amounts from 0 to 10 mole % of the total number of units, specifically 0 to 5 mole , more specifically 0 to 2 mole %. In an embodiment no additional imide units are present in the polyetherimide. [0042] The polyetherimide can be prepared by any of the methods well known to those skilled in the art, including the reaction of an aromatic bis(ether anhydride) of formula (5): with an organic diamine of formula (6): H2N-R-NH2 (6) wherein T and R are defined as described above.
