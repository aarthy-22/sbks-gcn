NT, NPY and PGP 9.5 presence in myomeytrium and in fibroid pseudocapsule and their possible impact on muscular physiology.
The uterine myoma pseudocapsule is a neurovascular bundle surrounding fibroid, containing neuropeptides, probably involved in uterine scar healing.
We studied neurotensin (NT), neuropeptide tyrosine (NPY), and protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) nerve fibres in the pseudocapsule neurovascular bundle of intramural uterine fibroids on 67 no pregnant women by intracapsular myomectomy sparing the neurovascular bundle, sampling full thickness specimens of the pseudocapsule of uterine fibroids (PUF) and normal myometrium (NM) obtained from the fundus uteri (FU) and the uterine body (UB).
The samples were sent for histological and immunofluorescent analyses and compared by morphometrical quantification.
The Conventional Unit (C.U.) difference of NT, NPY, and PGP 9.5 nerve fibres was statistically analyzed.
Our results showed that NT, NPY, and PGP 9.5 neurofibers are almost equally present in PUF as in NM of a no pregnant uterus.
As all of these neuropeptides are present in the uterine muscle and can affect muscle contractility, uterine peristalsis and muscular healing.
A myomectomy respecting the pseudocapsule neurofibers should facilitate smooth muscle scarring and promote restoration of normal uterine peristalsis with a possible positive influence on fertility.
