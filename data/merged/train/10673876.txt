Use of tranexamic acid for an effective blood conservation strategy after total knee arthroplasty.
We have investigated the effect of treatment with tranexamic acid, an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, on blood loss, blood transfusion requirements and blood coagulation in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 42 patients after total knee arthroplasty.
Tranexamic acid 15 mg kg-1 (n = 21) or an equivalent volume of normal saline (n = 21) was given 30 min before surgery and subsequently every 8 h for 3 days.
Coagulation and fibrinolysis values, blood loss and blood units administered were measured before administration of tranexamic acid, 8 h after the end of surgery and at 24 and 72 h after operation.
Coagulation profile was examined (bleeding time, platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), plasminogen, beta-thromboglobulin and fibrinogen).
Fibrinolysis was evaluated by measurement of concentrations of D-dimer and fibrinogen degradation products (FDP).
Total blood loss in the tranexamic acid group was 678 (SD 352) ml compared with 1419 (607) ml in the control group (P < 0.001), and occurred primarily during the first 24 h after surgery.
Thirteen patients received 1-5 u. of packed red blood cells in the control group compared with two patients in the tranexamic acid group, who received 3 u. (P < 0.001).
Postoperative packed cell volume values were higher in the tranexamic acid group despite fewer blood transfusions.
Postoperative concentrations of plasminogen were decreased significantly in the tranexamic acid group (P < 0.001).
Platelet count, PT, aPTT, bleeding time, beta-thromboglobulin, fibrinogen and FDP concentrations did not differ between groups, but D-dimer concentrations were increased in the control group.
Thromboembolic complications occurred in two patients in the control group compared with none in the tranexamic acid group.
