[New prospects in the treatment of migraine].
The options for migraine treatment have increased in the recent years and will expand in the near future.
In this work both recent and future options for migraine treatment are critically reviewed.
Firstly the late advances in the symptomatic treatment of migraine, including the new 5-HT1B/D agonists "triptans" appeared after sumatriptan, are reviewed.
Possible alternative, such as selective 5-HT1D and 5-HT1F agonists, are also discussed.
In the second part of this manuscript the new, possible options for the preventive treatment of migraine comprising "antiepileptics", such as valproic acid, gabapentin and topiramate, calcium-antagonists, such as cyclandelate and dotarizin, and a miscellany, including riboflavin, are analysed.
Finally, possible compounds for the future, such as the selective inhibitors of neurokinin receptors or drugs acting upon neuronal calcium channels, are commented.
From this review we conclude that while there have been relevant advances in the symptomatic treatment of migraine, there is a need for the development of better preventive compounds.
