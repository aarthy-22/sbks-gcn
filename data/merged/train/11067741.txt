Stable expression of varied levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase in primary cultures of endothelial cells.
Nitric oxide (NO*), generated by nitric oxide synthase (NOS II) from immunostimulated cells during infection, plays an important role in host immune defense against microbial invasion.
The impact of different rates of NO* production on host cell function has not been defined.
Herein, we describe the development of a method to express varied levels of murine NOS II in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells.
A retroviral vector (pMFGSNOS) encoding NOS II was used to transduce primary cultures of endothelial cells.
Bovine endothelial cells were susceptible to this transduction and up to 18% of the cells expressed immunodetectable murine NOS II.
The NOS II-transduced endothelial cells were cultured on the three-dimensional matrix, Gelfoam, for 8-10 days.
Stable expression of NOS II was assessed by measuring nitrite accumulation in media every 2 days.
By day 10, endothelial cells on Gelfoam were found to secrete NO* at a rate exceeding 1.0 microM/h/10(6) cells, concomitant with an enhanced level of NOS II activity.
Argininosuccinate synthetase, a key enzyme in the metabolism of l-citrulline to l-arginine, increased as well, perhaps in response to dimunition of the intracellular arginine pool corresponding to the observed high output of NO*. In spite of the continuous flux of NO*, endothelial cell viability was not effected.
This system provides the opportunity to assess the impact of different levels of sustained NO* production on endothelial cell physiology.
