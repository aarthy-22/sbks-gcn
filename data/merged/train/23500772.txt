Activation of ALDH2 with ethanol attenuates diabetes induced myocardial injury in rats.
This study assessed changes in myocardial ALDH2 expression in the diabetic rat, in particular the diabetic rat pretreated with ALDH2 activator ethanol (EtOH).
The rats were divided into six groups: control, EtOH control, diabetic rat at 4th week (DM4W), 8th week (DM8W), 12th week (DM12W) and EtOH+DM8W groups.
Compared with control group, fasting blood glucose (FBG) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were increased in DM groups.
HbA1c level in DM12W group was higher than in DM4W group, HbA1c level in EtOH+DM8W group was lower than in DM8W group.
Compared with control group, there were no changes of LVDP, HR and ±dp/dtmax in DM4W group, but there were decreased in DM8W and DM12W groups, and increased in the EtOH+DM8W group.
In DM groups, SOD activity, ALDH2 mRNA and protein levels were reduced, MDA content was increased compared with control group; which decreased further as diabetes progressed.
Compared with DM8W group, SOD and ALDH2 in EtOH+DM8W group was increased, MDA was decreased.
Our results indicated with the development of diabetes, myocardial ALDH2 expression was further decreased accompanying decreased ventricular function.
However, activation of ALDH2 can decrease diabetes induced myocardial injury.
ALDH2 may be one key endogenous cardiac protective factor in diabetic individuals.
