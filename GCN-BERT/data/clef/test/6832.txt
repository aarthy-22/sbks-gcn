This patent application is also related to U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 12/175,4^-2, filed July 17, 2008, Each of the aforementioned applications is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. FIELD [0002] The embodiments disclosed herein relate to a medical device for suturing tissue, and more particularly to a device for the manipulation and control of a suturing; needle during minimally invasive suturing, methods lor making such a-device and methods for using sueh a. device for suturing tissue. BACKGROUND [0003] Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has allowed: physicians to cany out many surgical procedures with less pain and disability than conventional, open surgery. Unlike conventional open surgery, where the surgical site is readily accessible through a large incision, enabling the surgeon to easily visualize and manipulate both tissue and instruments, MIS requires the surgeon to operate remotely by inserting and manipulating instruments: through small punctures ("keyhole surgery”), or through natural orifices, including for example the vagina, the esophagus, or the anus. [0004] In MIS, a small puncture is typically made in the body. Medical instruments are then inserted through a cannula. A cannula has a small inside diameter, typically 5-10 millimeters, (mm), and sometimes up to 20 millimeters (mm) or more. A number :of such cannulas may be inserted into the body for any given operation. Minimally invasive surgical, instruments are necessarily smaller, and are also generally longer:and therefore are more difficult to manipulate with precision. [0005] Perhaps the most problematic surgical task in MIS is suturing. Suturing requires coordinated manipulation with both hands of small needles and sutures that arc difficult to visualize (particularly when only indirect two-dimensional video imaging is available) as well as the several instruments (including needle-drivers and pick-up forceps) ordinarily used to suture by hand. In anenv ironmeni characterized by limited space, limited visualization, and limited mobility, many surgeons find minimally invasive suturing by hand an extremely difficult, often virtually impossible, surgical task. [0006] In the .preferred-method-of suturing by h and, a grasping forceps (" needle dri ver" ) is held by the surgeon and is used to grip a curved >needJe near the needle’s tail, Pronation of the surgeon's wrist drives the needle into the tissue. When the point of the curved: needle emerges from the tissue, the surgeon releases the needle from the grip of the needle driver and grasps the point with another forceps ("pick-ups"). The surgeon then pulls the curved needle by the needle point, preferably ina circular path following the arc of the needle's curvature to follow the most atraumatic path through the tissue, until the entire length of the needle has exited the tissue. Each time a stitch is .placed, the-curved needle is thus driven around in a complete circular arc. Indi vidual (interrupted) stitches are placed by tying: off the suture following placement of each stitch. Running (continuous) stitches are placed by repeatedly driving the curved needle in a complete circular arc repeatedlyuntil: the desired length of suture and number of stitches has been placed. In order to: place additional interrupted or continuous stitches, the surgeon must let go of the point of the needle and re-grasp the needle near the needle's tail, [0007] In; the manual suturing technique described above, the direct handling of the needle can result in accidental needle pricks through a surgeon or nurse’s gloves, posing a potential risk of infection for the surgeon, nurse, staff, and patient, or cause the needle to become contaminated with pathogenic bacteria that can cause onset of infection at the site of the sutures. There is also a risk of the needle penetrating internal organs or vessels and causing a serious, and often fatal infection. [0008] Various devices; for suturing for MIS are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,643,295 entitled "Methods and Apparatus for Suturing Tissue":, U.S. Pat. No. 5,665.096 entitled "Needle Driving Apparatus and Methods of Suturing Tissue"; U.S. Pat. No. 5,665,109 entitled "Methods: and Apparatus for Suturing Tissue1’; I l.S. Pat. No. 5,759,! 88 entitled "Suturing Instrument with Rotatably Mounted Needle Driver:and Catcher"; U.S. Pat.

No. 6,719,763 entitled '’Endoscopic Suturing Device''; and U.S, Pat. No. 6,755,843 entitled "Endoscopic Suturing Device"., all of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties for the teachings therein. [0009] Assignees’ U.S. Pat. No. 5,437,681, U,S, Pat, No. 5,540,705 and U.S. Pat. No. 6.923,819 disclose a suturing device with thread management comprising a protective cartridge, suturing: needle and needle rotation drive, the disclosures of which arc hereby incorporated by reference; The devices described in the above-mentioned patents and patent application comprise a meehanism for driving a protected needle however, the needle is rotated about an axis that is parallel to the axis of the device. In addition, the orientation and ske of the suturing device makes it difficult to visualize and cumbersome to use for MIS, [00010] Therefore, there remains a need in the art-Tor a minimally invasive suturing device that is easily manipulated within the small diameter of the cannula; functions in an environment characterized by limited space, limited visualization, and limited mobility;: mimics-the; preferred method of suturing used by surgeons; permits the surgeon to secure and tie knots quickly and with controlled, tension; places continuous: stitches; and protects, users from.:accidental needle: sticks during needle handling, as well as internal organs and vessels from inadvertent needle- SIJMMARY [0001.1] Devices :and: methods for minimally invasive suturing of tissue internal to a body are disclosed herein. [00012] According to aspects illustrated herein, there is. provided a medical device for closing openings internal to a patient's body, which closely emulates or replicates the manual suturing actions carried out by a surgeon. The device offers several advantages over conventional methods used by surgeons for suturing tissue during minimally invasive surgery in that the device provides a hand-held suturing instrumentthat requires no.external motive source. The presently disclosed embodiments provide relative ease of operation for the surgeon with only one hand. [00013] According to aspects illustrated herein, a suture head assembly may be removably attached to an: actuator mechanism of the suturing device. The diameter of the device is small enough to fit into a 5mm cannula in some embodiments, thus making the device extremely easy to maneuver, as well as suture, during endoscopic or other MIS procedures. In surgical procedures, it.-is desirable-to make as few incisions as .possible, and for those incisions to be as small as possible. As such, devices with reduced profile are highly advantageous. Also, the suture head assembly of the device can be laterally articulated to the left of center, to the right, of center, up, and down, once inside: the cannula, which is ideal for use in the course of endoscopic surgery, Including laparoscopy, thoracoscopy and arthroscopy, as well as other less-invasive surgical procedures. [00014] Devices of tile present disclosed,embodiments closely emulate or replicate the manual suturing actions earned out by a surgeon. For example, during manual suturing by hand, the needle is held in forceps and tray-els in a circular arc with no: obstructions anywhere in; the interior of the arc. The design, of the .suturing devices of the present disclosed embodiments allows for a lack of obstruction in the center of the arc of ihe needle dulltig: suturing. In other words, there is no hub at the center of the circular arc of the. suturing needle. The entire area within the circular arc of the needle is: unobstructed. This allows for the user to. have better visualization during operation, unlike the present mechanical suturing methods, while maintaining control over needle movement. [00015] A benefit pro vided by suturing devices of the presently disclosed embodiments is that the devices enable maneuvering a suturing material through a tissue incision in a manner substantially similar' to the way a surgeon would do so by hand. In particular, some embodiments of the suturing device first push a suturing needle from the tail of the needle and drives the point of the needle through the tissue. The device then picks up the point of the needle that passed through the tissue, and pulls the remainder of the suturing needle and the suture attached to the suturing needle through the tissue. The suturing needle thus consistently: follows the arc of the needle's own curve, which is the preferred method of suturing, in the most atraumatic way of passing.-a needle through tissue, A benefit provided by the suturing device of the presently disclosed embodiments is the ability of the suturing needle to pull the suturing thread entirely through the tissue segments being closed, following each stitch, When using the suturing device of the presently disclosed embodiments, no ancillary instalments or tools such as needle holders, pick-up forceps or the like are needed to complete the stitch. A forceps or grasping instrument: can be used: to tighten the knots. [00016] According to aspects illustrated herein, there, is provided an embodiment of a suturing device that includes a suturing needle that is protected by a housing, the suturing needle is not exposed to or handled directly by the user, thereby preventing inadvertent needle sticks. The configuration of the suturing device of the presently disclosed embodiments also protects against inad vertent penetration of internal organs or ves sels by the needle, since the .housing-actsas; a shield between the organs aiid the needle. [00017] In one embodiment, a suturing device is provided, having a-suturing head. The suturing head includesa housing defining at least one passage therein and a. deployable needle track. The deployable needle track is disposed in the housing, and the needle (rack is adapted and configured to be deployed, or expanded from a stored or contracted condition wherein the needle track is essentially disposed within the housing to an expanded, or deployed condition wherein the needle track extends outwardly front-the housing to form an arcuate needle track, The device further includes an arcuate prcircular needle disposed in the deployable needle track, the needle having a first end, a second end, and a generally toroidal body.

This disclosure presents illustrative: embodiments by way of representation and not limitation, Numerous other modifications and embodiments can he devised by those skilled in the art which fall within the scope and spirit of the principles of the presently 'disclosed embodiments. DETAILED DESCRIPTION [00037] Reference will now be made in detail to the present preferred embodiments of the disclosure, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. The method and comesponding steps of the disclosed embodiments will be described in conjunction with the detailed description of the system. [00038] Broadly:speaking, the disclosure provides embodiments of suturing devices having features that permit the device to be constructed on a smaller .scale and having .a smaller profile than embodiments discussed m the prior art and in patent applications incorporated herein by reference. I n particular, embodiments made in accordance with the present disclosure have been constructed that are adapted and configured to fit through a 5mm trocar. Advantageously, the disclosed embodiments still use a comparatively large suturing needle, thereby permitting substantial tissue capture during operation, resulting in effective suturing. [00039] For purposes of illustration and not l imitation, as embodied herein, an exemplary embodiment of a suturing device 1000 is illustrated in Fig. I. Device 1000 includes three regions, including a suture head 100, an intermediate region 500, and a handle 600, Each of these regions is discussed in detail below. Figs. 2-3 illustrate device 1000 with certain portions removed. In particular, Fig. 2 illustrates device 1000 with a needle loader removed (discussed in further detail below), while Fig. 3 illustrates device 1000 with certain portions of the handle housing removed. [00040] For purposes of illustration, and nos limhation, suture head 100. separated from the remainder of device 1000, is illustrated in Fig. 4. Suture head 100 includes a proximal end Κ)2, a distal end 104, and is formed by the cooperation of three, main housing components (106, 108, 112) that define a gap 110 for-receiving tissue of a patient to be sutured together. Suture' head 100 is adapted and configured to direct a scmi-ckeular needle (300, 350,4001 about a semicircular track andacross gap 1:10 to form a series of sutures through tissue to be sutured. [00041] Prior to advancing needle across gap 110, suture head 100 must be: converted from a delivery configuration to a deployed configuration. As illustrated in Fig. 4 and: Fig. 5, suture head 100is initially provided in a compact form having a predetermined: transverse dimension, or diameter, φ. This transverse dimension, φ, can be any desired dimension, and is preferably about 5 millimeters. In particular, the dimension φ is preferably selected so that suture head: 100 can pass through a standard 5mm trocar into a patient’s abdomen, for example, during,a laparoscopic surgical procedure. Fig, 5: shows suture head 100 From the opposite angle as; compared to Fig. including pivot boss which mates intermediate portion: of device 1000. [00042] Suture head 100 is illustrated in deployed configuration in Fig, 6. As/iUustrated in Fig. 6. in a deployed configuration, proximal guide 120 and distal guide 130 are moved outwardly irorn their nested position defined by housing components 1.06,108, discussed in further detail below. When deployed as in lug. 6. guides 120, 130 define a circular needle path or track 14$ that lies in a plane Ρ that is parallel to a longitudinal axis X of device 1000. In addition- as illustrated, leading tip 3Q2 of needle 300 Is advanced slightly by virtue of being; dragged along by virtue of a pawl 125 in proximal guide 120 engaging^ notch 306 disposed along an interior surface of needle 300, discussed in detail, below. [00043] After guides 120, 130 are in a deployed condition and needle track. 140 is defined, needle 300 can then be advanced through track by advancing pawl 160 to a distal extremity along its path of reciprocation. Fig. 7 illusiiales needle "3QQ:; spanning the gap 110, wherein needle 300, being about 180° in arcuate: extent, is essentially located outside of the enclosure: defined by housing segments 106, 108, 112. [00044] Figs. 8-10 illustrate the functionality of suture head 110 from the opposite side of the head. Fig, 8 illustrates suture head 100 in a delivery configuration with the guides 120,. 130 retracted. As can be seen, engagement pawl 160 is withdrawn to a position proximal to the needle 300, and the trailing . end 304 of needle 300 is visible. Fig. 9 illustrates suture head in a deployed configuration wherein guides 120,130 are deployed. As seen in Fig. 9, distal guide 130 defines an arcuate recess 135 that receives the pawl 160 at the distal extremity of its reciprocating movement, best observed in Fig. 10. As is evident from Fig. 10, notch 158 in drive member 150 is advanced in a distal direction as is pawl 160. [00045] Figs. I1{A)-11(D] illustrate the structure of the engagement pawl 160. Paw! 160 includes: a housing 1.66 attached (e.g., welded) to the distal end 154 of drive member 150, Housing 166 is preferably a metallic tubular structure, and houses a pawl spiring 164 biased be tween a movable pin 168 and cap portion 162, Cap is preferably attached to housing such las be welding. [00046] Fig. 12 illustrates suture liead; 100 with cover portion 106 removed, revealing: the reciprocating guide path'followed by drive member 150 and pawl 160, as well as guides 120, 130. Guides 120. 130 are advanced from the delivery configuration to the deployed configuration by four advancement wires, cables or filaments, 1:72,174, 176, 178 that are directed around a series of bosses in housing portion 106, discussed below. In particular, each guide 120,130 includes crimps 102a, 120b, 130a. L30b that integrally form a end of each of the guides 120, 130. Each crimp includes passages formed therein for receiving an end of wires. 172-178. Wires 172-178 can take any suitable form, most preferably multi-strand 300 series Stainless Steel cables .009” in diameter. These ends are then crimped, adhered or.otherwiseattached to the crimps. Then by applying tension to one wire in each pair attached to each guide, the guides 120, 130 are pulled into: or out of the suture head. 100. [00047] Fig. 13. illustrates the guides 120,130 in a deployed condition and does not display wires 172-178 simply for purposes of clarity, Fig, 14 illustrates drive member 150 -with pawl 160 at the full distal extent of its travel, riding within groove 135 in the side of guide 130. The elevation-130℮ of wall 130d can be increased and can be thickened to coincide with groove 135 to provide an enhanced bearing surface For pawl 160. Stops (not shown): are preferably provided in the form of raised: surfaces on guides 120, 130 and the housing components to help prevent guides 120, 130 from falling out of suture head. [00048] As i s also evident, groove 125 in the side of guide-120 becomes, accessible for the passage of pawl when the guides are in a deployed condition. As illustrated in Fig. 14, guide 150 traverses an arcuate path along guides and follows the path of the needle.

Fig, 1.8 shows the suture head 100 in: tact, while Figs,- 19-20 shows the positioning of bosses 106a. 106b. (06c on housing portion 106 that define bearing points for guide cables 172.174,176.178 (not shown}-. Spacers 106d may also be provided to maintain a desired distance between housing components 106. 108 to permit the movement of components within suture head 100, andean also act as bearing surfaces for wires 176, 178 (Fig. 29). Figs. 2&21 illustrate removal of guard 109 which provides inner support for guides 120. 130 to bear against. Guides 120, 130 ride in arcuate channels defined by the cooperation of components 106, 108 and 109. [00050] Fig. 22 illustrates proximal and distal guides 120, 130,in the same spatial relationship as in Fig. 21. Views ofthe proximal guide 120 are depicted in Figs. 23(Α)-23(Β). Guides 120. 130 are preferably made from a metallic material by assembling a series of metallic subcomponents, such as by laser welding, and are unitary and integral once assembled. Guides can be thought of as having a "“fop”-Face .that'faces the drive member 150, and a bottom “face*’ that faces housing portion 108. Proximal guide 120 defines a curved channel 125 in the top face 122. thereof. Proximal guide 120 further defines a lower face 124, having a groove 124b defined therein, an inner face 126 that bears against the inner surface of guard 109 and an outer face 128 that bears against housing components 106, 108. As illustrated in Figs,/24(Α)-24:(Β), distal guide 130 defines a curved channel 135 in the top face 132 thereof for guiding the pawl 160. Distal guide 130 further defines a lower face 134, having a groove 134b defined therein, an inner face 136 that bears against the inner surface of guard 109 and an-outer face 138 that bears against housing components 106, 108. [00051] Figs. 25-32 illustrate the cooperation between wires/filaments 172-178 and guides 120, 130, As shown in these figures, wires/filaments 172,174, 176: and 178 cooperate with bosses 106b, and .tbe other components of suture head 100 to: permit guides 120, to be selectively advanced and retracted, Wire 178 terminates, in crimp 130b of guide 130, Applying tension to; wire 178, which wraps around boss 106a (Fig. 28) results in:guide 120 being: advanced out of the suture head 100. Conversely, applying tension to wire 176, which terminates in crimp 130a of guide 130 (Fig. 30) causes guide 130 to be retracted into suture head 100. ■Similarly; applying tension to wire 172, which wraps around boss 106c and is attached to guide 120 at crimp 120b. causes guide 120 to be advanced out of suture head, while applying tension to wire 174. which wraps around boss 106c in a direction opposite towire 172, pulls- at the attachment point at crimp 120a. causing the guide 120 to be withdrawn back into the housing, [00052] Figs. 33- 37 illustrate an embodiment of a needle loader 180 that is configured for loading a suturing needle (300, 350, 400) into suture head 100. Needle loader 180 has two main components, including a main body portion 182 and an advancement portion 184. Pin 184a of advancement portion is received in opening 182a of main body portion 182. Main body portion 182 defines a groove 182f for receiving a suturing needle (300, 350, 400). Main body portion 182 includes a central portion 182 d and clip portions 182c. 182℮ that 111 over suture head 100. If desired, clip portions 182c, 182e maybe adapted to snap fitoyer suture head 100.: A distal stop plate 182b is provided to facilitate axial alignment between loader 180 and suture head 100. Advancement portion 184 rotates within opening 182a of main body portion 182, and further includes a needle pushing arm 186. In operation, a needle is situated within track 184f with suturing material attached to the trailing end, as: discussed herein. The loader 180 is then snapped onto suture head. Aim 186 is preferably situated at this time proximate the trailing end of the needle. Arm 186 is then rotated such that needle (300, 350. 400) is advanced into the needle track 140. If needed, needle (300, 350, 400) can be advanced back into the: needle loader 180, by virtue of the fact that arm 186 is dimensioned to pass through the grooves 124b,. 134b of proximal guide 120 and distal guide 130, respectively, [00053] Figs. 38-40 illustrate a Erst embodiment of a suturing needle 300. Needle 300 includes: an--arcuate body defined by a leading; end 302, a trailing end 304 and a generally toroidal surface 305, Needle: 300 includes a plurality of notches 306, 308, 31.0 formed therein, as well as an opening 312 in trailing end 304 for receiving an end of a length of suturing material 312a, Notches 306,. SOS are located on an inner radial region 322 of needle, while notch 310 has a projection that lies within a plane P? that is defined by the central curved axis X’ of the needle, Notch 310 includes it first portion 310a that is generally perpendicular to the plane; P; and a portion 310b that generally lies in plane P’, and a sloped portion 310c. The notches 306, 308 have projections that are generally perpendicular to the plane P’, Notches 308. 306 have first; portions 306a, 308a. that ;are generally parallel to across section of the needle in that location, and sloped portions 306b, 3O8b that, arc angled (such; as by an angle of 60 degrees) with respect to portions 306a, 308a. Notches 308,. 310 intersect to facilitate the function.of the particular embodiments of suturing head 100,100’ described: herein. [00054] Figs. 41-44 illustrate a second embodiment of a suturing needle 350. Needle 350 includes an arcuate body defined by a leading end 352. a trailing end 354 and a generally toroidal surface 355. Needle 350 includes a plurality of notches 356. 358, 360 formed therein, as well as an opening 362 in trailing end 354 for receiving an end of a length of suturing material. Notches 356, 358 are located on an inner radial region 372 of needle, while notch- 360 has a projection that lies within a plane P’ that is defined by the central curved axis X’ of the needle. Notch 360 includes a first portion 360a that is generally perpendicular to the plane P’ and a portion 360b that generally lies in plane Ph and a sloped portion 360℮, The notches 356. 358 have projections that are generally perpendicular to the plane P*. Notches 358. 356 have first portions 356a. 358a that: are generally parallel to a cross section of the needle in that location, and sloped portions 356b, 358b that are angled (such as by an angle of 60 degrees) with respect to portions 356a, 358a. Notches 358, 360 intersect to facilitate: the: function of the particular embodiments.-of suturing head 1:00, 100’ described herein. Needle 350 further includes a generally square cross-section having a rounded portion 366 and a tail portion 364, also having a round cross section, Stated another-way, the needle body includes a .portion with around cross section 366 that separates a main portion: of the needle with a generally square cross section from a tail portion: 364 with a generally square cress section. It is believed that using a needle with a square cross section helps the needle 350 cross the gap 110 of suture head and re-enter suture head with superior: alignment as compared to needle 300. [00055] Fig, 45 illustrates a -.third embodiment of a: suturing needle 400, Needle 400 includes an arcuate body defined by a leading end 402, a bailing end 404 and a generally toroidal surface 405, Needle 400 includes a plurality of notches 406. 408.410 formed therein, as well as. an opening 4X2 in trailing end 404 for receiving an end of a length of suturing material.

The notches 406. 408.410 are; generally similar to those described with respect to needle 300. The principal difference between needles 300, 400 are the addition of an additional notch 415 cut into the needle proximate its trailing end 404, Notch 415 has a projection in the; plane P’ and is shaped to receive the housing 166 of the pawl 160. It is bel ieved that using a needle with notch 415 helps the needle 400 cross the gup 110 of suture head and re-enter suture head with superior alignment as compared to needle 300. [00056] Fig. 46 illustrates a fourth embodiment of a suturing needle 450. Needle 450 is essentially the sarneas needle 300, except that it Further includes an arcuate keel 475. or raised surface, along its length. Keel 475- is adapted and configured:to ride in grooves 124b, 134b of .guides 120, 130 to stabilize the needle 450 as it crosses; the gap 110 of suture head and re-enters suture head with superior alignment as compared to needle 300. [00057] Figs, 47(Ρ)-55 illustrate aspects of an alternative embodimentof a suture head 100’ made in accordance with the disclosure. The principal difference between suture head 100 and suture head 100’ lies in the path of travel of the drive element 150. [00058] Embodiment 100 of suture head includes a drive member 150: that defines a narrowed,-or notched region 158, as illustrated in Fig, 12, for example. In operation, notched region: 158 is located to coincide with bosses 106W, 108W (Figs. 47(A)-4:7(Dj) when pawl 160: is located at the distal extremity of its range of motion within groove 135 of distal guide 130. When in this position, drive member ISO extends into groove 125 of proximal guide 120 (Fig. 14). However, as soon as tension is then applied to bring pawl 160 (and needle 300) proximally along the needle track, the narrowed region158 of drive member: 150 slips past bosses 106W, 108W, so that pawl 160 will travel up lower leg of passage 106Τ when moving-proximally until it passes; boss 1.06W arid emerges from.the passage, ready to begin another'cycle.. Stated another way, bosses 106W,, 108W result in a passageway between them that permits narrowed region 158 to slip through, but notthe rest of member 150 or pawl 160. Thus, narrowed region 158 permits the drivemember 150 to travel along, an upper path above bosses 1Q6W, 1Q8W when advancing distally, and slip past bosses 106W, 108W when region 158 aligns with the bosses, thus permitting drive member 150 and pawl 160 to moveproxlmally along a lower path below bosses 1U6W, 108W. Housing portion 112 is illustrated in Fig. 47(Ε), Accordingly, it can be. appreciated that drive, member '150. should ideally be. metallic, Preferably, member ISO is made from hardened' stainless steel that has been heat treated to HR 900, and, may have a chromium coating, such as an Armoloy ME 92® coating commercially available from ME-92®; West/Amioloy® of Illinois, 118 Simonds Avenue, DeKalb, IL 6.0115. (815) 758-6691, Preferably, member 150 is .17-7 .PH Stainless steel,, condition ”C" that is then hardened, to condition :CH900, and then coated with a ME 92® coating. Preferably, the ME-92® coating is applied after 900 Heat Treatment. The sequence of operations in manufacturing member 150 includes providing 17-7 PH strip stock material that is machined..to size by any number of known methods (e,g,, electrical discharge machining (“EDM”), shearing, milling, etc.). The drive ribbon is heat treated, and then cleaned to: remove heat treatment surface oxidation, and the ME-92 ®-coaling is then applied. By way of further example, 17-7ΡΗ condition "A" material can be heat treated to R-H950. In other embodiments, the drive member 150 can be made, for example, from shape memory material such as nickel-titanium alloys sold under the trade name of NUINOL® and the like. In another embodiment, member 150 is made from a polymeric material, in one aspect, member 150 can include; polyethylene terephthalate material or nylon material of high s trength. If desired, a laminate of plas tic and metal materials or multiple materials can beused. Byway of further: example, member 150 can be comprised of a bundle of wires or filaments, a single wire or filament, or any material in any configuration that permits chi vine the needle; around the needle: track. [00059] The other components of suture head 100 including the needle 1300. etc.) are preferably formed by metal injection molding ("MIM”) techniques, as are known in the art from various materials, preferably stainless steel, In accordance with a preferred embodiment, 17-4 PH stainless steel'alloy is preferably used. Device 1000 is preferably a disposable device, and handle components aid preferably made from injection molded plastic wherever desirable, 1000601 A further embodiment of a suture head 100’ is .set forth in Figs. 47(Ρ)-55. The principal difference between suture head 100' and suture head 1 GO is that the drive member 150 in suture head 100' follows a single; path during reciprocation, in contrast with the alternating path of embodiment 100. Fig, 47(F) illustrates suture head 100’ including a needle 300 with guides 120’, 130’ in a deployed con figuration. Guides 120’ 430’ are only partially represented and are not depicted including crimps at their extremities for mating with deployment or retraction cables as with embodiment 100 discussed earlier. Suture head 100’ defines a guide path 153’ between housing components 106’, 112’ (Fig. 48), similar to the manner in which •suture head. 100 defines a guide path between housing components 106 and 112 (Fig. 21). Fig. 48 further illustrates an alternate path 1001 that can be traversed by drive member 150’ by modifying components 106’. 112’ by removing material 112a’ that acts as a pawl stop and adding material 106*b in component 106’ to act as a new pawl stop, The end result is a different, angle of incidence for the drive member 150. [00061] Fig. 49; illustrates the “left” housing component 108’ from various angles, while Figs, 50(Α)-50(Εΐ illustrate the “right'' housing component from various angles. Apparent from the figures is the path 153’ followed by the drive member 150’ and pawl 160’ (not shown). It will be appreciated that drive member 150’ and pawl 160’ can be substantially identical to embodiments 150, 160, but need not have the notched region 158, as a single path for traversal of pawl 160’ is defined by cooperation of housing components 106’ , 108’, Guard 109’ is illustrated in Figs 51(Α)-51 (Β):, and i llustrates the: location of pawl 115 ’ that helps prevent needle (e.g., 300) from moving against the: direction of desired travel. Fig. 52 illustrates the spatial relationship of guides 120’, 130’ with respect, to pin face I68a! and pawl 160’ in their two respective locations, for purposes of illustration only. Figs, 53(Α)-53(0) illustrate various views, of housing portion 112’.

Opening 872b, in contrast, is large enough to permit terminations 874 to pass into knuckle 872, thus joining cable 53.2 to cable 534, and providing a closed loop to facilitate articulation, by way of articulation and brake .control "'800. Brake trigger 884 can be pulled, causing a camming effect of by moving an upper portion of handle component 882 (and its counterpart on the left side of the device) into contact with lower brake pad 850, causing the brake pad 850 to compress components 830 between the upper and lower brake pads 820,. 850. [00069] Figs. 92-102 illustrate aspects of the operation and control for the guides 120,130: as well as the locking mechanism tor trigger 700, Guides 120, 130 are deployed or withdrawn by rotating handles 892. Cables 172-178 are muted over guide 885, which is held in place by housing components 612, 614 and are split up-into, two pairs of wires, wherein one set of wires is directed downwardly -around spring loaded pulleys 894a, 896a and routed up to handles 192 where all four cables, 172, 174, 176, 178 are: held in place in openings 892b in handles 892 by tapered pins 893. The other pair of cables is routed about guide 887 directly into handles 892, Guide (Fig. 93(B)) is a generally curved planar; member having a plurality of cable guides 885a, wherein the cables 172-1:78 bear oyer its upper surface: on their route to handles 892, Fig, 93(A) illustrates guides 887 and 885 in situ .in; relation; to other internalcoraponents of handle 600. Guide 887 (Figs. 93(0-93(0)) include bosses 887a to be received by housing portions 612, 614, and grooves 887b defined by fins 887c for routing cables/wires. Handles 892 include grips 892aand grooves 892c and channels 892d for directing cables/wires into openings 892b (Figs. 94(Α)-94Ε), Both handles 892 can be essentially identical in form. [00070] Guide; handles 892 also play a role; in releasing trigger lock 780, thereby permitting trigger 700 to actuate the movement of needle (e,g„ 300). As illustrated in Figs, 95(Α)-95(Β), trigger lock 780 is attached to a cable at ferrule 781, which is disposed in opening 783 at bifurcation 782 of trigger lock (Rigs . 95{C)-95(D)), Trigger lock 780 is slidably disposed on a cylindrical rail 786, and is biased toward a locked position by spring 787. A bifurcation 784 at the opposite, end of bigger lock 780 is adapted and configured to interlock with b igger 700. When the cable to which ferrule 781 is attached is advanced upwardly (Fig..: 95.1 Bn by rotating handle 892L. bifurcation 784 of bigger lock 780 disengages from trigger 700, permitting free movement of trigger. Handles 892L, 892R are pivotally disposed on a\ie 891 (Figs., 96, 122 ). Figs. 97-101 further illustrate additional features of the actuation system for guides 120, 130 with progressively additional components removed to better illustrate other components, and their relative positions. Fig, 102 further illustrates additional aspects and views of components 840ν 894,896, [00071] Figs. 103-113 illustrate aspects of the operation of reciprocating trigger mechanism 700., Fig, 103 illustrates the relative positions of trigger 700, pull cable/ribbon 710, trigger spring capsule 720, trigger return spring 730, pull cable 727 and pulley 750.

Trigger 700 is further illustrated in Figs. 106(Α)-106(Β) from two additional angles, showing bifurcated yoke 702 proximate the top end of trigger 700. Yoke cap 704 is received in trigger handle 700 by securing studs 704a into holes 700a by interference fit and/or ultrasonic welding, adhesive:or the like, Yoke 702 and yoke cap 704 define openings 702a, 704a therein for receiving bosses 888a of shuttle link (Fig. 99(B)). Fig. 107(A) illustrates the interior of.capsule 720, revealing cluteh,spring 724. Figs. 107.(Β)- 107(C) illustrate housing portion 720a, which mates with housing portion 720b, Housing portion. 720b is an identical mirror image of portion 720a. so only 720a is illustrated. Clutch spring 724 is removed in Fig. 108, clearly illustrating pull cable 727, clutch spring ferrule 723 and clutch: washer 726. Fig. 109 illustrates the assembly with spring 730 and housing portion 720b removed. Fig. 110 illustrates a close up of the connection of drive member 710 to assembly 720. showing the manner in which tabs 71.1, 712 at proximal end of drive member 710 are bent and inserted through the slot 721a in washer plate 721. O-rings 720. which may he silicone or other suitable material, are illustrated in Figs, 104 and 109. O-rings 729 provide a seal against housing segments 612, 614. Ferrule 723 is secured, to cable 727. Figs. II1-11.3 provide closer views of ferrule 723, washer plate 721 and proximal, end of member 710. respectively. [00072] Figs. 114-120 further illustrate the connections between drive member 7 10 and drivemembei-s 150/551. As illustrated in Fig. 114, proximal drive member, which can include ribbon-element 150 described above attached tp intermediate cable section 551 in intermediate region 500, is received by a ferrule 910 which is affixed in place after termination 930 is attached, and positioned into cavity 922 in coupling by passing eable/rod 551 through slot 924 in coupling 920, Rounded portion 932 of termination faces distally, permitting movement between member 551 and coupling 920. As illustrated in Figs, 115-117, termination 930 defines a passage 936 therethrough for receiving cable 551, and defines a: generally cylindrical proximal section 934. Ferrule 910 defines a passagc912 therethrough,for receiving cable 551, and a transverse opening 914 therethrough, such as for receiving brazing or soldering material or other materialfor holding ferrule in place on cable 551. Coupling 920 includes a proximal face 922a, a distal face 928 and a bore 922 therethrough. As illustrated in Fig, 114 in cooperation with Figs. 118-120. threaded male fitting; 940 is received within threaded opening 922 of coupling, and receives a retaining hex;nut 950 thereon. Proximal end 943 of fitting 940 faces proximally, and defines a cavity 946 therein forrecei ving, distal,tip 717 of drive ribbon/cable 710. Tip:? 17 is inserted into cavity 946 until stop 719 contacts proximal face 943, Threads 942, 952 are defined on fitting 940 and nut 950. Components 940, 710 may be coupled by any suitable means, including but not limited to interference Fit and/or welding, soldering, brazing, adhesive and the like. Figs. 121 -122 illustrate torsion,spring 960 and guide spring 970 and their positioning with, respect to the other components within handle 600. Springs 960, 970 are a part of the control mechanism for deployingand retracting guides 120. 130. Return spring 895, 897 is illustrated in Fig. 12 ltd. |00073| An exemplary method of operation of suture head 100 is set forth; in Figures 123-131. Fig, 123 illustrates a cutaway view of suture head 100 with needle 300 disposed therein in a delivery configuration with guides 120, 130 retracted. Needle 300 is wholly contained within device 1000, and pawl spring 1,1.5b prevents needle 300 from moving in a counterclockwise direction. Similarly, pawd spring 115a is biased against the inner circumferential surface 322 of needle, tending to prevent needle from moving in a clockwise direction. As set forth in Figs. 123-131, it is apparent from the instant disclosure that the drive system of the device 1000. is adapted and configured to advance the needle 300 in multiple 360° revolutions about the needle track when the needle track is in a deployed condition. It is further evident that the needle track is about 180 in extern prior to deployment,, andgrealer than 180' in angular extent after deployment. [00074] Fig. 124 illustrates the initial deployment of guides. Pawl 115a is dragged along surface 322 of needle 300 until it engages with notch 308 and pawl 115b engages with notch 306, Guides are then fully retracted in Fig, 125, and pawl 115a situated in guide 120 drags needle 300 in a clockwise direction to present itfor suturing. Pawl 160 meanwhile is advanced along its arcuate track along guides 120;. 130 to its distalmost extent, causing notch 158 in the drive member 150 to align with boss 108 a, and pawl 115 b bears against surface 122 of needle 300. When dri ve member 150 is then pul led proximally, notched region 158 of member 150 slips past bosses 106a, 108a and drive member 150 drops into lower passage defined in part by passage 108Τ. Further proximal movement, of dri ve member 150 causes the. hi stall y located wider: portion of ribbon 150 to bear against the underside of bosses 106a, 108a, and pawd 160 makes contact with the trailing end of the needle 300, and needle is ad v anced about 180°, as illustrated in Fig. 126. The distal movement of pawl 160: is then, repeated, such that pawl 160 engages with notch 310 in needle 300. Region 158 slips past bosses 106a, 108a as before, and pawl Τ60 and the leading tip 302 of needle are pulled along die arcuate needle: track 140, resulting in the needle being returned torts, starting point, as illustrated in Fig, 128, Fig, 129 illustrates guides 120.130 in partial retraction such that needle is moved counterclockwise until notch 306 meets with pawl 115b. Fig. 130 illustrates guides 120, 130 retracted even further, illustrating how pawl 115a is pulled out ol notch 308 and is dragged along surface 322 of needle;, further counterclockwise movement of needle 300 is prevented by pawl 115b being locked into; notch 306 Fig. 131 illustrates .suture head 110 once again in delivery or removal configuration with guides 120. 130 fully withdrawn. Thus, a device is provided herein that can rotate the disclosed needle through 180°:, 360°, or any further multiple of 180° as desired. If desired, the angular increments of advancement could be increments of more or less than 180° as desired . [00075] The suturing devices of the presently disclosed embodiments can be; used for laparoscopic procedures, including but not limited to laparoscopic colostomy, colectomy, adrenalectomy, splenectomy, repair of paraesophageal hernia, inguinal hernia repair, ventral JtetTlia repair, Nissen fundoplication, li ver lobectomy, gastrectomy,: small bowel resection, treatment of small bowel obstruction, distal pancreatectomy, nephrectomy and gastric bypass. Those skilled in the art willrecognize that the presently disclosed embodiments can be used in other laparoscopic procedures.. [00076] In using the devices of the presently disclosed embodiments, the abdomen is insufflated with gas to create a working space for the user. Any gas known to those skilled in the art including, but not limited: to, nitrogen or carbon dioxide, can be used. Access portals are established using trocars in locations to suit the particular surgical procedure, A variety of surgical instruments may then be inserted into the body through these access ports/cannulas. The user then introduces the distal end portion of the suturing, device into a, cannula, and then •articulates the suture head assembly (e.g., 100, lOQ5). The suture head assembly is then positioned relative to the tissue/vessel to. be sutured together, and the user preferably locks the suture head assembly in place, The user then,, through maniprdation of the suturing device,, positions a plurality of separated tissue segments into the opening defined at the distal end portion of the.suture head assembly. The user, using.only one hand, may manipulate the device while actuating the handle to close an incision with:a continuous suture whose stitches may be individually tensioned precisely and uniformly along the length of the suture simi lar to suturing done by hand in the conventional way . The user may employ a single suture which would extend the entire length of the: incision or multiple sutures. Thus, by placement of the device spanning the incised.tissue segments/and actuating the handle, the suturing device enables the user to lay down a running stitch or interrupted stitch to close the tis sue incision in a time efficient manner. Those skilled in the art will recognize that any conventional procedure for conducting laparoscopic surgery can be used with the device,. [00077] The minimalized structural design of the suture head assembly enables the user to have a clear, unobstructed view' of thevsutmmg needle during advancement.through the tissue segments during the course of a suturing Operation, thereby enabling precise placement of the suturing device to provide uniform sutures and precluding the risk of tearing tissue by placement too close to the edge of the incision. The suturing device is then advanced a short distance along the incision and the aforementioned operation is repeated to produce another stitch comprising the suturing material or thread, [00078] The user may continue to manipulate the suturing device, alternately advancing and actuating rotation of the needle about an axis that is generally parallel to the direction of advancement to create: a continuous suture which may extend through the entire length of the incision or a series of interrupted stitches'. After each individual stitch is laid down, the stitch is tightened by exerti ng a pull on the suturing material or thread so that the resultant suture is tensioned uniformly along the length of the incised-tissue segments. Therefore, a tight closure of the segments is accomplished and bleeding and tearing of. tissue arc minimized. Once: the appropriate: amount of suture material or thread 246 has been placed, the user can use: a needle grasper to: tighten, and knot the formed stitches.
