Short duration of diabetes and disuse of sulfonylurea have any association with insulin cessation of the patients with type 2 diabetes in a clinical setting in Japan (JDDM 30).
Insulin therapy is often required to achieve good glycemic control for the patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), while protraction of glycemic control without insulin therapy may be preferable for patients.
To determine the characteristics of and therapeutic regimen in outpatients with T2DM who were able to stop insulin therapy with satisfactory glycemic control in a real clinical practice setting in Japan by a case-control study.
The present study was performed on 928 patients with T2DM who started insulin therapy in 2007.
Data regarding age, sex, body mass index, duration of diabetes, HbA1c, postprandial plasma glucose, plasma fasting C-peptide immunoreactivity and treatment modality were compared between patients who were able to stop insulin therapy and those who continued with insulin.
Of the 928 patients, 37 had stopped insulin therapy within 1 year.
In the patients who stopped insulin therapy, the duration of diabetes was significantly shorter and the daily insulin dosage at initiation and the prevalence of sulfonylurea pretreatment significantly lower compared with patients who continued on insulin.
In conclusion, almost 4% of T2DM patients were able to stop insulin therapy with satisfactory glycemic control in a real clinical practice setting in Japan.
Shorter duration of diabetes and disuse of sulfonylureas prior to insulin may associate with stopping insulin therapy as a near-normoglycemic remission in outpatients with T2DM in Japan.
