Synthesis of novel estrogen receptor antagonists using metal-catalyzed coupling reactions and characterization of their biological activity.
Estrogen receptor (ER) antagonists are valuable in the treatment of ER-positive human breast cancer.
In this study, we designed and synthesized nine new derivatives of 17β-estradiol (E2) with a bulky side chain attached to its C-7α position, and determined their ER antagonistic activity using in vitro bioassays.
Four of the derivatives showed a strong inhibition of ERα transactivation activity in a luciferase reporter assay and blocked ERα interactions with coactivators.
Similarly, these derivatives also strongly inhibited the growth of the ERα-positive human breast cancer cells.
Computational docking analysis was conducted to model the interaction of these antagonists with the human ERα and showed that they could tightly bind to the ERα in a manner similar to that of ICI-182,780, a pure ER antagonist.
These results provide an example that attachment of a bulky side chain to the C-7α position of E2 can produce ER antagonists with ER affinity comparable to that of ICI-182,780.
