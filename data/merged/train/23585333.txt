Tandem Assays of Protein and Glucose with Functionalized Core/Shell Particles Based on Magnetic Separation and Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering.
Tandem assays of protein and glucose in combination with mannose-functionalized Fe3 O4 @SiO2 and Ag@SiO2 tag particles have promising potential in effective magnetic separation and highly sensitive and selective SERS assays of biomaterials.
It is for the first time that tandem assay of glucose is developed using SERS based on the Con A-sandwiched microstructures between the functionalized magnetic and tag particles.
