Field of the invention [0002] The present invention relates to therapeutic compositions derived from amnion materials and methods of use. Background [0003] Amniotic membranes are being used in clinical trials to treat a wide range of conditions. Amniotic membranes are typically placed directly on a treatment location, such as a wound or scare. In many cases however, amniotic membranes Sack the proper architecture and cell viability to effectively provide the desired therapeutic responses, such as tissue regenerations, i munomoduSation, anti-inflammatory and antiftbrotic. Most amniotic membranes are dehydrated and cryogenicaiiy preserved. In other cases, the amniotic membranes are sterilized in a manner that damages the tissue and/or reduces cell viability.

[0059] As shown if FIG, 1 A the amniotic membrane surround a fetus in utero. As shown in F!G. 1 B, the amniotic membrane comprises an amnion portion and a chorion portion. As described herein, the amnion portion may be separated from the chorion, tn an exemplary embodiment the epithelium, or inner most layer of the amniotic membrane, is removed and used to produce particles for the therapeutic composite, as described herein. The particles may consists essentially of the epithelium, consists essentially of the epithelium and base membrane, consist essentiaiiy of the epithelium, base membrane and compact layer, or consist essentiaiiy of epithelium, base membrane, compact layer, and fibroblast layer, [0060] As shown in F!Gs, 2A and 2B, the epithelium layer of the amniotic membrane 20 has a single layer of amniotic stem ceils 48, The tissue around the amniotic stem cells may protect and enhance the viability of these stem cells when the epithelium is cryo-fractured to produce particles for the therapeutic composition. [0061] As shown in FIG. 3A« an amniotic membrane 20 comprises a plurality of amniotic stem cells 48. [0062] As shown in FIG, 3B, particles of cryo-fractured amniotic membrane particles 40 are on the order of 0.2 to Ο.δμΓη in size. The average particle size shown is less than 2pm. There are no particles shown that are larger than 2pm and substantially all of the particles are less than 1 pm in size.

In addition, an amniotic membrane may be stretched in one or more direction to tensilize the tissue, A tenstlize amniotic membrane may have a higher matrix tensile strength than an original un-tensilized amniotic membrane. In addition, a plurality of layers of amniotic membrane may be utilized to build strength in one or more directions. [0064] As shown in FIG. 5A, an amniotic membrane 20 has been stretched in one direction to form an elongated and more aligned amniotic tissue orientation. As shown in FIG, 5A, oriented tissue 23 is aligned horizontally and connecting tissue interconnects the oriented tissue. A tensilized amniotic membrane 21 may be stronger by unit weight in the oriented direction and may have a much higher elongation to break in the cross-oriented direction than a precursor amniotic membrane, before tensiSizing. The tensilized amniotic membrane 21 may be stretched as much as 120%, 150%, 175%, 200% of the original membrane length. The amniotic membrane may neck or narrow in the opposing direction of stretch. A stretched or tensilized amniotic membrane may be stretched over a long period of time to minimize tissue fracture. For example, an amniotic membrane may have a low load applied and may be stretched over a period of 10 minutes or more. 30 minutes or more, 1 hour or more, 8 hours or more, 1 day or more, 2 days more and any range between and including the durations provided.

The analyses shows that the expression level of mesenchymal stem ceil surface antigens is consistent between donors with CD44 being positive and CD73 being strongly positive while CO90 and CD105 are low positive. The level of expression is maintained between the processed samples concentrated sample 1 and concentrated sample 2 and unprocessed samples (Fresh Amniotic Fluid 1&2), suggesting no cell loss during the manufacturing process and preservation of potency. What is also interesting is that CD73 is expressed the most. It has been reported that mesenchymal stem cell migration is controlled by CD73 and therefore It is speculated that a high !evei of CD73 expression promotes ceil migration and the ability of the cells to home to tissue sites of repair or to participate in healing responses. Example 1 £0082] Three fluid components were made and cell viability was measured as reported in Table 1. Three amniotic membrane samples, obtained from three separate donors, were cryo-fractured and dispersed in fluid to create a fluid components, as described herein. [0083] A fluid component of the therapeutic composite was prepared by concentrations amniotic stem ceils in a ceil suspension solution. A 1mi sample of an unprocessed amniotic fluid was used to measure initial ce!i count and viability.

Cell pellet from each tube was washed with 20m! of Plasma Lyte-A, from Baxter Inc., between centrifugation. Supernatant was removed and cells were re-suspended In a predetermined volume of cell suspension solution. Plasma Lyte-A, to obtain a final product cell concentration of 1 x 10s cell/mi. [0084] Cryo-fractured particles of amniotic membrane were prepared for dispersion in the fluid component. Three amniotic membranes were obtained and rinsed using Plasma Lyte~A and transferred to a cutting board. Using blunt dissection, chorion was removed from the amniotic membrane and any remaining debris/blood was removed using sterile laps. The amniotic membrane dimensions were measured using a sterile stainless steel ruler. The amount of amniotic membrane needed to obtain a concentration of 1cm2/m( of therapeutic solution was retained and placed on a sterile drying rack and allowed to dry for one hour. The amniotic membrane was then cut into smalt pieces, less than a 1cm2 and placed inside a milling chamber containing a blunt impactor. The cryo-miSI used was from SPEX Sample Prep Inc., 697QEFfv! Enclosed Freezer/Sv i yodel 8970D. [0085] The milling chambers were placed Inside the cryomill and the amniotic membrane was micronized. The frequency of the impactor was 8 cycles per second, the preceding time was five minutes, the grinding time was three minutes and the intermediate cooling time was two minutes, After the micronization of the amniotic membrane was complete, the chambers were removed from the cryomill and allowed to warm at room temperature for one hour. The cryo-fractured amniotic membrane was then dispersed in 100ml of fluid component prepared as described in this example. The final therapeutic composite was prepared by combining 100ml or the fluid component and micronized amniotic membrane with equal volume (100ml), of cryprotectant solution, CryoStor 10, available from Sigma-Aldrich, Using a repealer pipet, cryovia!s were then filled at the desired volume. The therapeutic solution was maintained at 4°C during the via! filling process to preserve ceii viability. [0086] The cryoviais were then cryop reserved using a controlled rate freezer. The controlled freezing protocol; cool at a rate of 1.C C/min until chamber reached - 4°C, cool at rate of 25.0°C/min until chamber reached -40°C, warm at a rate of 1 G,Q°C/min until chamber reached -12aC, cool at rate of 1 ,0°C/min until chamber reached -40°C, and cool at rate of 10.0°C/min until chamber reached ~90i:iC. Cryoviais were then placed into cryo-boxes and transferred to a -80.0°C freezer. [0087] Thawing of the cryoviais was performed and cell viability was again measured. Cell viability pre and post cryopreservation is reported in Table 1. The cryoviais were removed from the ~S0,0°C freezer and allowed to thaw at room temperature until the fluid components in the vial had a slushy consistency, or approximately three minutes for a 1 ml sample. An equal amount of cold Plasma Lyte-A was added to the sample for a 1 ;2 dilution. Samples were mixed and a small aliquot was used to perform cell count and viability enumeration. Cell count and viability was assessed using Trypan Blue.
