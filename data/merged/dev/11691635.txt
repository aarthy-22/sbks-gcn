Compensatory changes in enzymes of arginine metabolism during renal hypertrophy in mice.
The present study investigates enzyme activities of the urea cycle, transamidinase and ornithine-proline inter-conversion in the hypertrophied kidney after unilateral nephrectomy in mice.
Surgical removal of the left kidney in mice led to compensatory enlargement of the right kidney after 1 and 14 days.
This renal growth was associated with an increase in glomerular volume (but not number) and enlargement of the proximal convoluted tubules.
The total renal protein content increased in proportion to the increase in kidney weight, but the protein per gram weight of kidney did not change.
The specific activity of only ornithine aminotransferase (OAT), the rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of ornithine to proline, increased in 2 weeks of hypertrophy.
The specific activity of all other enzymes was unchanged.
However, the total enzyme activity per kidney of all the enzymes, without exception, was elevated in the hypertrophied kidney.
While the increase in total OAT activity was much more than the increase in kidney weight, all other enzymes increased more or less in proportion to the increase in renal mass.
The results suggest that compensation in OAT activity to chronic reduction in renal mass was complete, but only partial in the case of other enzymes.
