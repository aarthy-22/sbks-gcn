In vivo effect of Schisandrin B on cytochrome P450 enzyme activity.
To investigate the possible drug interaction, this study is designed to evaluate the ability of Schisandrin B (Sch B) to modulate cytochrome P450 3A activity (CYP3A) in vivo and to alter the pharmacokinetic profiles of CYP3A substrate (midazolam) in treated rats.
Rats were repeated administered with physiological saline (negative control group), ketoconazole (75mg/kg, positive control group) or varied doses of Sch B (experimental groups) for three consecutive days.
Subsequently, changes in hepatic microsomal CYP3A activity and the pharmacokinetic profiles of midazolam and 1'-hydroxy midazolam in plasma were studied to evaluate CYP3A activity.
The results indicated that Sch B significantly dose-dependently inhibited rat hepatic microsomal CYP3A activity with Ki value of 16.64mg/kg and showed the characteristic of a noncompetitive inhibitor.
Oral administration of Sch B for 3 days in rats produced significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of oral midazolam.
Sch B resulted in a significant, dose-dependent increase in midazolam AUC0-∞ except at the dose of 2mg/kg, while AUC0-∞ increased by 26.1% (8mg/kg) and 60.6% (16mg/kg), respectively.
In the pharmacokinetic profiles of 1'-hydroxy midazolam, the significant, dose-dependent decrease in AUC0-∞ was observed except at the dose of 2mg/kg, while AUC0-∞ reduced by 44.5% (8mg/kg) and 49.2% (16mg/kg), respectively.
These results suggested that 3-day treatment of Sch B could increase concentration and oral bioavailability of drug metabolized by CYP3A.
When the drug, consisting of Sch B, is used in the clinic for more than 3 days, the possible drug-drug interactions should be taken into consideration.
