Anti-diabetic activities of Gegen Qinlian Decoction in high-fat diet combined with streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
Gegen Qinlian Decoction (GGQLD) is one of the well-known traditional Chinese medicines.
Recently, it was reported that GGQLD had good clinical effects on type 2 diabetes mellitus.
However, few studies have confirmed in detail the anti-diabetic activities of GGQLD in vivo and in vitro.
In the present study, we investigated the anti-diabetic effects of GGQLD in high-fat diet combined with streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
The present results suggested GGQLD (4.95, 11.55 and 18.15 g/kg) decreased significantly fasting blood glucose, glycosylated serum protein, and glycosylated hemoglobin of diabetic rats (p<0.05), and GGQLD (4.95 and 18.15 g/kg) decreased significantly fasting serum insulin levels of diabetic rats (p<0.05); in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, Gegen Qinlian Decoction-containing serum (GGQLD-CS) (4%, 8% and 16%) enhanced glucose consumption, triglyceride (TG) content, adiponectin protein concentration and the mRNA expression of adiponectin.
Adiponectin contributes to the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism, and can play a critical role in the development of diabetes mellitus; the mechanisms of action of GGQLD might be related to augmentation of adiponectin protein concentration and up-regulation of the mRNA expression of adiponectin.
However, the multi-target mechanisms of action of GGQLD need to be clarified further.
The present study further validated the beneficial effects of GGQLD as an anti-diabetic agent.
These findings provide a new insight into the anti-diabetic application for GGQLD in clinic and display the potential of GGQLD as a new drug candidate for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.
