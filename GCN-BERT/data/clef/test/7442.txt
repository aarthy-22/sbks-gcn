TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a 11-deoxy-prostaglandin compound for use in a method of treating specific diseases in a mammalian subject. BACKGROUND ART Vascular diseases are often the result of decreased perfusion in the vascular system or physical or biochemical injury to the blood vessel. Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) is defined as a disease of blood vessels often encountered as narrowing of the vessels of the limbs. There are two main types of these disorders, functional disease which doesn't involve defects in the blood vessels but rather arises from stimuli such as cold, stress, or smoking, and organic disease which arises from structural defects in the vasculature such as atherosclerotic lesions, local inflammation, or traumatic injury. This can lead to occlusion of the vessel, aberrant blood flow, and ultimately to tissue ischemia. One of the more clinically significant forms of PVD is peripheral artery disease (PAD). PAD is often treated by angioplasty and implantation of a stent or by artery bypass surgery. Clinical presentation depends on the location of the occluded vessel. For example, narrowing of the artery that supplies blood to the intestine can result in severe postprandial pain in the lower abdomen resulting from the inability of the occluded vessel to meet the increased oxygen demand arising from digestive and absorptive processes. Severe forms the ischemia can lead to intestinal necrosis. Similarly, PAD in the leg can lead to intermittent pain, usually in the calf, that comes and goes with activity. This disorder is known as intermittent claudication(IC) and can progress to persistent pain while resting, ischemic ulceration, and even amputation. Peripheral vascular disease is also manifested in atherosclerotic stenosis of the renal artery, which can lead to renal ischemia and kidney dysfunction. One disease in which vascular diseases and their complications are very common is diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus causes a variety of physiological and anatomical irregularities, the most prominent of which is the inability of the body to utilize glucose normally, which results in hyperglycemia. Chronic diabetes can lead to complications of the vascular system which include atherosclerosis, abnormalities involving large and medium size blood vessels (macroangiopathy) and abnormalities involving small blood vessels (microangiopathy) such as arterioles and capillaries. Patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of developing one or more foot ulcers as a result of established long-term complications of the disease, which include impaired nerve function (neuropathy) and/or ischemia. Local tissue ischemia is a key contributing factor to diabetic foot ulceration. In addition to large vessel disease, patients with diabetes suffer further threat to their skin perfusion in at least two additional ways. First, by involvement of the non-conduit arteries, which are detrimentally affected by the process of atherosclerosis. Second, and perhaps more importantly, by impairment of the microcirculatory control mechanisms (small vessel disease). Normally, when a body part suffers some form of trauma, the body part will, as part of the body's healing mechanism, experience an increased blood flow. When small vessel disease and ischemia are present, as in the case of many diabetics, this natural increased blood flow response is significantly reduced. This fact, together with the tendency of diabetics to form blood clots (thrombosis) in the microcirculatory system during low levels of blood flow, is believed to be an important factor in ulcer pathogenesis. Neuropathy is a general term which describes a disease process which leads to the dysfunction of the nervous system, and one of the major complications of diabetes mellitus, with no well-established therapies for either its symptomatic treatment or for prevention of progressive decline in nerve function. The thickening and leakage of capillaries caused by diabetes primarily affect the eyes (retinopathy) and kidneys (nephropathy). The thickening and leakage of capillaries caused by diabetes are also associated with skin disorders and disorders of the nervous system (neuropathy). The eye diseases associated with diabetes are nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, diabetic maculopathy, glaucoma, cataracts and the like.. Others, although not known to be related to diabetes are similar in their physiological effects on the peripheral vascular system. Such diseases include Raynaud syndrome, CREST syndrome, autoimmune diseases such as erythematosis, rheumatoid disease, and the like. Prostaglandins (hereinafter, referred to as PG(s)) are members of class of organic carboxylic acids, which are contained in tissues or organs of human or other mammals, and exhibit a wide range of physiological activity. PGs found in nature (primary PGs) generally have a prostanoic acid skeleton as shown in the formula (A): On the other hand, some of synthetic analogues of primary PGs have modified skeletons. The primary PGs are classified into PGAs, PGBs, PGCs, PGDs, PGEs, PGFs, PGGs, PGHs, PGIs and PGJs according to the structure of the five-membered ring moiety, and further classified into the following three types by the number and position of the unsaturated bond at the carbon chain moiety: Subscript 1: 13,14-unsaturated-15-OHSubscript 2: 5,6- and 13,14-diunsaturated-15-OHSubscript 3: 5,6-, 13,14-,and 17,18-triunsaturated-15-OH. Further, the PGFs are classified, according to the configuration of the hydroxyl group at the 9-position, into α type (the hydroxyl group is of an α-configuration) and β type (the hydroxyl group is of a β-configuration). PGE1 and PGE2 and PGE3 are known to have vasodilation, hypotension, gastric secretion decreasing, intestinal tract movement enhancement, uterine contraction, diuretic, bronchodilation and anti ulcer activities. PGF1α, PGF2α and PGF3α have been known to have hypertension, vasoconstriction, intestinal tract movement enhancement, uterine contraction, lutein body atrophy and bronchoconstriction activities. Some 15-keto (i.e., having oxo at the 15-position instead of hydroxy)-PGs and 13,14-dihydro (i.e., having single bond between the 13 and 14-position)-15-keto-PGs are known as the substances naturally produced by the action of enzymes during the metabolism of primary PGs. U.S. Patent No.6,197,821 to Ueno et al. describes that some 15-keto-PGE compounds are an antagonist for endothelin which is considered to have a relation to hypertension, Buerger disease, asthma, eyegrounds diseases, and the like. U.S. Patent No. 6,197,821 indicates that when the bond between 13- and 14-positions is saturated, a keto-hemiacetal equilibrium may sometimes be formed by the formation of a hemiacetal between the hydroxy group at 11-position and the keto group at 15-position. U.S. Patent No. 5,317,032 to Ueno et al. describes prostaglandin compound cathartics, including the existence of bicyclic tautomers and U.S. Patent No. 6,414,016 to Ueno describes the bicyclic tautomers as having pronounced activity as anti-constipation agents. The bicyclic tautomers, substituted by one or more halogen atoms can be employed in small doses for relieving constipation. At the C-16 position, especially, fluorine atoms can be employed in small doses for relieving constipation. US 4 126 754 describes 11-deoxy prostaglandin type compounds, i.e. prostaglandin type compounds in which the 11-hydroxy group is replaced by hydrogen, with processes for making them. These compounds are useful for a variety of pharmacological purposes, including anti-ulcer, inhibition of platelet aggregation, increase of nasal patency, and labor induction at term. DE 28 03 127 describes 11-deoxy prostaglandin analogs, several processes for their manufacture as well as their use as a drug. US 4 119 727 describes 11-desoxy-prostaglandin F2 derivatives and process for their preparation. WO 01/05388 describes a composition for treatment of external secretion disorders comprising, as an active ingredient a fatty acid derivative. The composition is useful for treatment of at least one condition selected from hypolacrimation including disorder of basal tear secretion, dry-eye syndrome, hyposalivation and dry-mouth syndrome. EP 0 690 049 describes a pharmaceutical composition for treatment of hepato-biliary disease reduced in side effect such as diarrhea, which comprises 16,16-difluoro-15-keto-PGs having at least one methyl group or ethyl group on the carbon atom at the 17- or 18-position or adjacent to the terminal methyl group of omega -chain as an essential component. US 3 671 570 describes derivatives of 9-oxo-15-hydroxy prostanoic acid, lower alkyl esters thereof, and homologs thereof, as well as a process for preparing the above acids, lower alkyl esters thereof, and homologs thereof. The compounds possess hypotensive, antihypertensive, bronchospasmolytic and gastric acid secretion inhibiting properties, as well as inhibiting the aggregation of platelets and promoting the disaggregation of aggregated platelets. Methods for their use are also disclosed. GB 1 292 661 describes postanoic acid derivatives and their preparation. Pharmaceutical compositions contain the compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents. The compounds possess hypotensive, antihypotensive, gastric acid secretion inhibiting and/or bonclospasmolytic properties. Tooke JE (Peripheral microvascular disease in diabetes. Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice, vol. 30 Suppl, February 1996, pages S61-S65) describes the functional breakdown of the microcirculation in diabetes mellitus. Currently used oral drugs for peripheral vascular diseases include cilostazol (commercial name: Pletaal) and prostaglandin (PG) preparations (commercial names: Dorner, Opalmon, etc.) having a vasodilative effect as well as an antiplatelet effect, ticlopidine mainly having an antiplatelet effect (commercial name: Panaldine), sarpogrelate (commercial name: Anplag) and ethyl icosapentate (commercial name: Epadel) which is also adaptable to hyperlipemia. They have different action mechanisms, so that it may be required to use two or three preparations in combination depending on pathology. Particularly in medium illness, multiple drugs are more likely to be applied. Injectable preparations include prostaglandin E1 preparations, antithrombin preparations (commercial name: Argatroban). They are in principle used for medium or more severe illness requiring hospitalization. The efficacy of the existing drugs is not wholly satisfactory. Particularly, antiplatelets such as ticlopidine or ethyl icosapentate are less effective, probably because it is unclear to which extent platelets are involved in each pathology, or whether the vasodilative effect is sufficient even if a drug has such an effect, or whether bloodstream at ischemic sites can be selectively enough ensured. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present inventor conducted an intensive study and found that 11-deoxy-prostaglandin compounds possessed selective significant effects on the peripheral vascular diseases, which resulted in the completion of the present invention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In the present invention, the "11-deoxy-prostaglandin compound" (hereinafter, referred to as "11-deoxy-PG compound") is as defined in claim 1. The formula (A) shows a basic skeleton of the C-20 carbon atoms, but the present invention is not limited to those having the same number of carbon atoms. In the formula (A), the numbering of the carbon atoms which constitute the basic skeleton of the PG compounds starts at the carboxylic acid (numbered 1), and carbon atoms in the α-chain are numbered 2 to 7 towards the five-membered ring, those in the ring are 8 to 12, and those in the ω-chain are 13 to 20. When the number of carbon atoms is decreased in the ω-chain, the number is deleted in the order starting from position 2; and when the number of carbon atoms is increased in the α-chain, compounds are named as substitution compounds having respective substituents at position 2 in place of the carboxy group (C-1). Similarly, when the number of carbon atoms is decreased in the ω-chain, the number is deleted in the order starting from position 20; and when the number of carbon atoms is increased in the ω-chain, the carbon atoms beyond position 20 are named as substituents. Stereochemistry of the compounds is the same as that of the above formula (A) unless otherwise specified. As stated above, the nomenclature of the 11-deoxy-PG compounds is based on the prostanoic acid skeleton. However, in case the compound has a similar partial structure as a prostaglandin, the abbreviation of "PG" may be used. Thus, a 11-deoxy-PG compound of which α-chain is extended by two carbon atoms, that is, having 9 carbon atoms in the α-chain is named as 2-decarboxy-2-(2-carboxyethyl)-11-deoxy-PG compound. Similarly, 11-deoxy-PG compound having 11 carbon atoms in the α-chain is named as 2-decarboxy-2-(4-carboxybutyl)-11-deoxy-PG compound. Further, 11-deoxy-PG compound of which ω-chain is extended by two carbon atoms, that is, having 10 carbon atoms in the ω-chain is named as 11-deoxy-20-ethyl-PG compound. These compounds, however, may also be named according to the IUPAC nomenclatures. Examples of the analogs (including substituted derivatives) or derivatives include a 11-deoxy-PG compound of which carboxy group at the end of α-chain is esterified; a compound of which α-chain is extended; physiologically acceptable salt thereof; a compound having a double bond at 2-3 position or a triple bond at position 5-6, a compound having substituent(s) at position 3, 5, 6, 16, 17, 18, 19 and/or 20; and a compound having lower alkyl or a hydroxy (lower) alkyl group at position 9 in place of the hydroxy group. According to the present invention, preferred substituents at position 3, 17, 18 and/or 19 include alkyl having 1-4 carbon atoms, especially methyl and ethyl. Preferred substituents at position 16 include lower alkyl such as methyl and ethyl, hydroxy, halogen atoms such as chlorine and fluorine, and aryloxy such as trifluoromethylphenoxy. Preferred substituents at position 17 include lower alkyl such as methyl and ethyl, hydroxy, halogen atoms such as chlorine and fluorine, aryloxy such as trifluoromethylphenoxy. Preferred substituents at position 20 include saturated or unsaturated lower alkyl such as C1-4 alkyl, lower alkoxy such as C1-4 alkoxy, and lower alkoxy alkyl such as C1-4 alkoxy-C1-4 alkyl. Preferred substuents at position 5 include halogen atoms such as chlorine and fluorine. Preferred substituents at position 6 include an oxo group forming a carbonyl group. Stereochemistry of PGs having hydroxy, lower alkyl or hydroxy(lower)alkyl substituent at position 9 may be α, β or a mixture thereof. Further, the above analogs or derivatives may be compounds having an alkoxy, cycloalkyl, cycloalkyloxy, phenoxy or phenyl group at the end of the ω-chain where the chain is shorter than the primary PGs.

Example 1 Test Compound A: 11-deoxy-13,14-dihydro-15-keto-16,16-difluoro-PGE1 Test Compound B: 11-deoxy-13,14-dihydro-15-keto-16,16-difluoro-PGE, isopropyl ester Male Wistar rats (7-week-old) were used in this study. Animals were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of thiobutabarbital sodium (80 mg/kg). Body temperature (rectal temperature) of the animals was maintained at approximately 37°C throughout the experiment with a heating pad. After depilating the instep of the right hind limb with a depilatory cream, the cutaneous tissue blood flow was measured continuously using a non-contact type laser Doppler flowmeter (FLO-N1, Omegawave Inc., Japan). For measurements of mean arterial blood pressure, a polyethylene catheter placed in the left femoral artery was connected to a pressure transducer (TP-400T, Nihon Koden Inc., Japan) coupled to an amplifier (AP-641G, Nihon Koden Inc., Japan). The cutaneous tissue blood flow and blood pressure were recorded and analyzed using a computer system (HEM Ver. 3.5, Notocord Systems, France). Endothelin-1 (ET-1) was infused into the femoral artery at a rate of 200 pmol/kg/min with a syringe pump via the polyethylene catheter inserted retrogradely into the caudal epigastric artery branched from the right femoral artery for 15 minutes. Infusion rate of ET-1 was decreased to 20 pmol/kg/min after the termination of 200 pmol/kg/min infusion, and the decreased amount of ET-1 infusion was kept until the end of this study. The cutaneous tissue blood flow was decreased by the infusion of ET-1 into the femoral artery. When the cutaneous tissue blood flow was reached a new steady level (25 to 50 minutes after starting ET-1 infusion), vehicle or each test compound solution was administered to the animals over 2 minutes in a volume of 1 mL/kg via the polyethylene catheter placed in the left femoral vein. The administered amount of the test compound was 100 µg/kg. The cutaneous tissue blood flow and blood pressure were measured continuously and recorded every 5 minutes for 60 minutes after the administration of vehicle or each test solution. As shown in Figs.1A and 1B, by the femoral arterial infusion of ET-1, the cutaneous tissue blood flow was decreased to approximately 37% of the baseline value between 25 and 50 minutes after starting ET-1 infusion. There was no alteration in the cutaneous tissue blood flow by the treatment with vehicle (Figs. 1A and 1B). In the 100 µg/kg Compound A (11-deoxy-13,14-dihydro-15-keto-16,16-difluoro-PGE1) group, the cutaneous tissue blood flow, which was decreased to approximately 35% of the baseline value by the ET-1 infusion, was significantly increased by the administration of Compound A (Fig. 1A). In the 100 µg/kg Compound B (11-deoxy-13,14-dihydro-15-keto-16,16-difluoro-PGE1 isopropyl ester) group, the cutaneous tissue blood flow, which was decreased to approximately 38% of the baseline value by the ET-1 infusion, was significantly increased by the administration of Compound B (Fig. 1B). The blood pressure was not affected by the ET-1 infusion. Compound A and Compound B at 100 µg/kg had no significant effect on the blood pressure. EXAMPLE 2 Test Compound A: 11-deoxy-13,14-dihydro-15-keto-16,16-difluoro-PGE1 Eight male Japanese white rabbits (Std:JW/CSK) weighing approximately 2.5-3.5 kg were used in this study. The same eye of each animal was treated with the test compounds and the other eye was with the vehicle consistently throughout the study with a washout period between each treatment. Thirty microliters of each test compound solution was applied topically to one eye of each animal using a micropipette (Pipetman, Gilson, Inc., France). The contralateral control eye received an equal volume of the vehicle. The animals were dosed at approximately the same time each morning. After the animals were restrained in a holder, one drop of topical anesthetic (0.4% oxybuprocaine hydrochloride) was applied to both eyes and the IOP was measured with an applanation pneumatonometer (Model 30 Classic™, Mentor O & O, Inc., USA) before dosing, and at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours after dosing. As shown in Table 1, Compound A significantly lowered the intraocular pressure.

Animals with plasma glucose levels 400 mg/dL or more on day 19 after the STZ treatment were used in this study. Three weeks after the STZ injection, animals were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of thiobutabarbital sodium. Body temperature (rectal temperature) of the animals was maintained at approximately 37°C throughout the experiment with a heating pad. After depilating the instep of the right hind limb with a depilatory cream, the cutaneous tissue blood flow (CTBF) was measured continuously using a non-contact type laser Doppler flowmeter (FLO-N1, Omegawave Inc., Japan). The blood pressure and heart rate were simultaneously monitored. Compound A or the vehicle was intravenously administered to the animals over 10 min. As shown in Table 2, Compound A significantly increased the cutaneous tissue blood flow as compared with the vehicle. Compound A had no effects on blood pressure (BP) and heart rate. Table 2.

Compound A: 11-deoxy-13,14-dihydro-15-keto-16, 16-difluoro-PGE1 EXAMPLE 4 Four months old male Kbs: J. W. rabbits were housed in aluminum cages in an animal room controlled for roomtenperature (23-24°C), relative humidity (55-74%), ventilation rate (10-20 times/hour) and 12-hour light/dark cycle (lighting: 7:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m.). The animals were feeded with solid diet for rabbits (120 g/animal/day) and water ad libitum from automatic eatering system. The animals were subjected to at least 6 days of quarantine and acclimation. During the period, their body weight measurements and general sign observations were conducted, and the animals judged to be in good health were used in this study. A cannula was inserted into the common carotid artery of the rabbit under inhalation anesthesia of isoflurane. Nine parts of the blood samples obtained through the cannula were mixed with 1 part of 3.8 w/v % sodium citrate. After centrifugation of the blood samples for 10 min at 1,000 rpm, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was collected from the top layer. Then the bottom layer was further centrifuged for 15 min at 3,000 rpm, and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) was collected from the top layer. The platelet counts of the PRP and PPP fractions were performed using an ADVIA120 Hematology system (ADVIA120, Bayer Medical Ltd.). The PRP fraction was diluted with the PPP fraction so that the platelet counts was adjusted to approximately 30 ×104 cells/µL. Thus obtained PRP (0.178 mL) was put into a cuvet, and pre-incubated on a warm bath at 37°C for about 5 minutes. Test solution (0.022 mL) containing prostaglandin E1 or Compound A was added to the PRP. One minute later, 25 µM ADP solution (0.022 mL) was added and the degree of platelet aggregation was measured using a platelet aggregation measuring device (NBS hematolaser, Nikko Bioscience Inc.). For each test solution, a duplicate test was performed on the blood samples from 3 animals. Inhibition rate (%) was evaluated by comparing the aggregation in the test substance group with that in the vehicle control group (100%). As shown in Table 3, prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) inhibited platelet aggregation by 20.9%, 91.2% and 89.0% at concentrations of 1 × 10-8 1 × 10-7 and 1 × 10-6 g/mL, respectively. On the other hand, Compound A showed no effect on platelet aggregation up to the highest concentration (1 × 10-5 g/mL) tested. The results indicate that Compound A has no effect on platelet aggregation.

Body temperature (rectal temperature) of the animals was maintained at approximately 37°C throughout the experiment with a heating pad. After depilating the instep of the right hind limb with a depilatory cream, the cutaneous tissue blood flow (CTBF) was measured before and 30 minutes after intravenous administration of Compound C (11-deoxy-13,14-dihydro-16,16-difluoro-PGE1) or the vehicle using a non-contact type laser Doppler flowmeter (FLO-N1, Omegawave Inc., Japan). The blood pressure and heart rate were also monitored. As shown in Table 4, Compound B significantly increased the cutaneous tissue blood flow as compared with the vehicle treatment. Compound B had no effects on blood pressure and heart rate. Table 4.

EXAMPLE 6 Human vascular endothelial cell culture was brought to confluence, as measured by transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER). The cell culture was then deprived of oxygen for 30 minutes by incubation in a nitrogen atmosphere. The cells were then either treated with 0.1% DMSO or with the combination of 5 nM Compound A and 0.1% DMSO (final concentrations). The cell density was determined by TEER at the indicated time points. As shown in Fig. 2A, the DMSO-treated cells showed very little recovery of TEER. The Compound A-treated cells showed immediate recovery of TEER. The results demonstrate that the damaged TEER, a measured barrier function of endothelial cells, recovers rapidly after Compound A-treatment. EXAMPLE 7 Human microvascular endothelial cells (adult) (HMVEC-AD) were grown to confluence. The cells were then exposed to a nitrogen atmosphere for 30 minutes and returned to the normal air atmosphere. ATP levels were monitored at the indicated time points using a luciferin-luciferase assay system (ATPlite, Perkin Elmer). As shown in Fig. 2B, ATP levels decreased when the cells were exposed to the nitrogen atmosphere. ATP levels returned more quickly in the cells treated with 5 nM Compound A compared to the cells treated with 0.01% DMSO alone. EXAMPLE 8 Male GK/Jcl rats, a spontaneous model of non-insulin-dependent diabetes, were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of thiobutabarbital sodium. Body temperature (rectal temperature) of the animals was maintained at approximately 37°C throughout the experiment with a heating pad. After depilating the instep of the right hind limb with a depilatory cream, the cutaneous tissue blood flow (CTBF) was measured before (base line) and 20 minutes after intravenous administration of Compound A or the vehicle using a non-contact type laser Doppler flowmeter (FLO-N1, Omegawave Inc., Japan). Data was expressed as % compared with the base line cutaneous tissue blood flow. As shown in Table 5, Compound A significantly increased the cutaneous tissue blood flow in the spontaneous diabetes rats as compared with the vehicle. Table 5.
