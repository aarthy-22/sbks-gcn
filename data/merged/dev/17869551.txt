Endothelial nitric oxide production is tightly coupled to the citrulline-NO cycle.
Nitric oxide (NO) is an important vasorelaxant produced along with L-citrulline from L-arginine in a reaction catalyzed by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS).
Previous studies suggested that the recycling of L-citrulline to L-arginine is essential for NO production in endothelial cells.
However, there is no direct evidence demonstrating the degree to which the recycling of L-citrulline to L-arginine is coupled to NO production.
We hypothesized that the amount of NO formed would be significantly higher than the amount of L-citrulline formed due to the efficiency of L-citrulline recycling via the citrulline-NO cycle.
To test this hypothesis, endothelial cells were incubated with [14C]-L-arginine and stimulated by various agents to produce NO.
The extent of NO and [14C]-L-citrulline formation were simultaneously determined.
NO production exceeded apparent L-citrulline formation of the order of 8 to 1, under both basal and stimulated conditions.
As further support, alpha-methyl-DL-aspartate, an inhibitor of argininosuccinate synthase (AS), a component of the citrulline-NO cycle, inhibited NO production in a dose-dependent manner.
The results of this study provide evidence for the essential and efficient coupling of L-citrulline recycling, via the citrulline-NO cycle, to endothelial NO production.
