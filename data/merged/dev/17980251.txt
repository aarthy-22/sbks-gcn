Inhibition of platelet aggregation by AZD6140, a reversible oral P2Y12 receptor antagonist, compared with clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes.
OBJECTIVES: In a substudy of DISPERSE (Dose confIrmation Study assessing anti-Platelet Effects of AZD6140 vs. clopidogRel in non-ST-segment Elevation myocardial infarction)-2, we compared the antiplatelet effects of AZD6140 and clopidogrel and assessed the effects of AZD6140 in clopidogrel-pretreated patients.
BACKGROUND: Clopidogrel, in combination with aspirin, reduces cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS).
However, patients with poor inhibition of platelet aggregation with clopidogrel may be less well protected.
AZD6140 is a reversible oral P2Y(12) receptor antagonist that has been studied in ACS patients in comparison with clopidogrel (DISPERSE-2 study).
METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive either AZD6140 90 mg twice a day, AZD6140 180 mg twice a day, or clopidogrel 75 mg once a day for up to 12 weeks in a double-blind, double-dummy design.
One-half the patients allocated AZD6140 received a 270-mg loading dose.
Patients randomized to receive clopidogrel were given a 300-mg loading dose unless they had already been treated with clopidogrel.
Adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation was assessed by optical aggregometry on day 1 and at 4-week intervals.
RESULTS: AZD6140 inhibited platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent fashion and both doses achieved greater levels of inhibition than clopidogrel (e.g., 4 weeks, 4-h postdose [mean (+/-SD)]: clopidogrel 64% [+/-22%], AZD6140 90 mg 79% [+/-22%], AZD6140 180 mg 95% [+/-8%].
AZD6140 also produced further suppression of platelet aggregation in patients previously treated with clopidogrel.
CONCLUSIONS: AZD6140 exhibited greater mean inhibition of platelet aggregation than a standard regimen of clopidogrel in ACS patients.
In addition, AZD6140 further suppressed platelet aggregation in clopidogrel pretreated patients.
