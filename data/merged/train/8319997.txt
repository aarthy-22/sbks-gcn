Comparative effects of three different potent renin inhibitors in primates.
The goal of the present study was to compare the effects of three potent reference renin inhibitors (remikiren, CGP 38560A, and enalkiren) in sodium-depleted normotensive squirrel monkeys.
In these monkeys, arterial pressure was measured in the conscious state with a telemetry system.
Oral and intravenous maximal effective doses of the three renin inhibitors were compared in parallel groups of monkeys.
In additional experiments, remikiren was given on top of either CGP 38560A or enalkiren in the same animals.
Finally, the three drugs were compared with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril.
The effects of the three drugs on the plasma components of the renin-angiotensin system (plasma renin activity, immunoreactive renin, and immunoreactive angiotensin II concentrations) were also measured.
Our results show that remikiren was as effective as cilazapril and markedly more effective than CGP 38560A or enalkiren in reducing arterial pressure in our monkey model.
Interestingly, these differences in arterial pressure could not be explained by differences of in vitro potency or different biochemical changes of the plasma components of the renin-angiotensin system, because the inhibitors all reduced immunoreactive angiotensin II to similarly low levels.
One possible explanation is that, in our model, remikiren in contrast to CGP 38560A and enalkiren is able to inhibit renin in a functionally important extraplasmatic compartment.
