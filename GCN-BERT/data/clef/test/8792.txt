BACKGROUND 1. Field Embodiments of the present invention relate to a water filter device for purifying water supplied from an external water supply source, and a refrigerator including a storage tank unit to store water purified by the water filter device. 2. Description of the Related Art Recently-developed refrigerators have a tendency to accomplish desired purposes of appliances equipped therein by filtering tap water (raw water) using a water filter device, and thus obtaining clear water (purified water). Such a refrigerator includes a water filter device provided with a water filter to purify water supplied from an external water supply source, and a storage tank to store the water purified by the water filter device. Even in a state in which a door of the refrigerator is not opened, the water filter device may supply the purified water to a dispenser and an ice maker, in order to dispense water and ice desired by the user. However, conventional refrigerators having the above-mentioned configuration have a difficulty in assembly operation because the water filter device and storage tank are separate from each other. For this reason, there is an increase in material costs and labor costs in the conventional refrigerators. SUMMARY Therefore, it is an aspect of the present invention to provide a refrigerator including a water filter device and a storage tank, which are integrated into a single assembly.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Reference will now be made in detail to the embodiments, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to the like elements throughout. The embodiments are described below to explain the present invention by referring to the figures. As shown in FIG. 1, the refrigerator includes a cabinet 1 to define an outer appearance of the refrigerator. A storage chamber (not shown), in which food may be stored, is defined in the interior of the cabinet 1. The storage chamber is partitioned into a refrigerating compartment and a freezing compartment by a barrier wall (not shown). Respective heat exchangers (not shown) and respective blowing fans (not shown) are installed at the rear of the refrigerating and freezing compartments, to independently generate cold air and to independently supply the cold air to the refrigerating and freezing compartments. A machinery chamber (not shown) is defined at a rear and lower portion of the cabinet 1, to install a compressor (not shown) and a condenser (not shown) therein. Using the compressor and condenser, a refrigerant is compressed and then condensed. The condensed refrigerant is sent to the heat exchangers. Doors 2 are installed at front sides of the compartments of the storage chamber, respectively, to selectively open or close the compartments. A dispenser 4 is provided at a selected one of the doors 2, for example, the door 2 of the freezing compartment, to provide water and ice desired by the user even in a closed state of the door 2. Also installed in the storage chamber are an ice maker 3 to receive water and to make ice from the received water, and a water filter device 10 to purify water, to store the purified water, and to supply the stored water to the dispenser 4 and ice maker 3. To this end, the refrigerator is also provided with a supply tube 6 to supply water from an external water supply source 5 to the water filter device 10, and a discharge tube 7 to supply water purified by the water filter device 10 to the ice maker 3 and dispenser 4. As shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, the water filter device 10 includes a case 20 installed in the storage chamber. The case 20 is defined with a space to receive a filter unit 30 to purify water supplied from the external water supply source 5 via the supply tube 6, and a water storage tank unit 60 to store the water purified by the filter unit 30. The case 20 is formed with a through hole 21 to guide the supply tube 6 and discharge tube 7 to an inlet 52 of a filter head assembly 50, which will be described later, and an outlet 62 of the storage tank unit 60, respectively. The filter unit 30 includes a water filter assembly 40 separably received in the case 20. The filter head assembly 50 is also included in the filter unit 30. The filter head assembly 50 is separably coupled to the water filter assembly 40. The water filter assembly 40 includes a filter case 41 to receive a filter (not shown), and a coupler 42 provided at one side of the filter case 41. The filter head assembly 50 is coupled to the coupler 42. A filter inlet 43 is formed through the coupler 42, to allow the filter head assembly 50 to receive external water therethrough. A filter outlet 44 is also formed through the coupler 42, to allow the filter head assembly 50 to discharge water purified after being introduced into the water filter assembly 40 through the filter inlet 43. A sealing member 45 may be fitted around an outer peripheral surface of the coupler 42, to prevent water discharged through the filter outlet 44 from leaking to the outside. The filter head assembly 50 includes a body 51 having an inlet 52, through which water from the external water supply source 5 is introduced, and an outlet 53, through which the water introduced through the inlet 52 is discharged in a purified state. Although not shown, the body 51 may be provided with a core (not shown) installed in the body 51 such that the core is extendable or retractable, and an elastic member (not shown) to elastically support the core. The inlet 52 is connected with the supply tube 6, to receive water from the water supply source 5. A connecting tube 70 is also connected between the filter head assembly 50 and the storage tank unit 60, to discharge water purified by the water filter assembly 40 to the storage tank unit 60. The outlet 53 of the filter head assembly 50 is connected to the connecting tube 70. As described above, the storage tank unit 60 is received in the case 20. The storage tank unit 60 includes a storage tank inlet 61 connected to the connecting tube 70, and a storage tank outlet 62 connected to the discharge tube 7, which supplies water introduced through the storage tank inlet 61 to the ice maker 3 and dispenser 4. Meanwhile, FIGS. 4 to 8 are views illustrating a water filter device according to another exemplary embodiment. As shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, the water filter device 10 includes a case 120 installed in the storage chamber, as in the previous embodiment. Although not shown, the water filter device 10 may be received in a recess formed at one side surface of a storage container 19 arranged adjacent to one side wall of the refrigerating compartment. That is, the water filter device 10 may be arranged at a position adjacent to the storage container 19 arranged at a lower portion of the refrigerating compartment 11, in order to efficiently use the internal space of the refrigerating compartment 11. FIGS. 12 and 13 illustrate an embodiment in which the water filter device is arranged at a position adjacent to the storage container. Referring to FIG. 12, the water filter device 10 according to this embodiment may be arranged between the storage container 10 arranged at a lower portion of the refrigerating compartment 11 and one inner side wall 16 of the refrigerating compartment 11. The storage container 19 is arranged beneath a storage container cover 12 arranged at the lower portion of the refrigerating compartment 11. The storage container cover 12 partitions the internal space of the refrigerating compartment 11, to define an upper space to store food and a lower space to receive the storage container 19. The storage container cover 12 is supported by the opposite inner side walls 16 of the refrigerating compartment 11, and covers the upper surface of the storage container 19. At least a portion of the storage container cover 12 may be made of a transparent material, in order to allow the user to identify food contained in the storage container 19. A recess 19a may be formed at one side surface of the storage container 19 arranged adjacent to one side wall 16 of the refrigerating compartment 11, to receive the water filter device 10. The recess 19a has a shape corresponding to an outer appearance of the water filter device 10. Accordingly, where the water filter device 10 is arranged between the storage container 19 and one side wall 16 of the refrigerating compartment 11, the water filter device 10 is tightly fitted in the recess 10a. In accordance with the above-described configuration, there is no reduction in the storage space of the refrigerating compartment 11, which may be caused by separate installation of the filter unit 20 and storage tank unit 80 in conventional cases. That is, the water filter device 10 is arranged in a useless space, which may be formed between the storage container 19 and one side wall 16 of the refrigerating compartment 11 in conventional cases. The case 20 of the water filter device 10 is also surrounded by the storage container 10. Accordingly, the space utility of the refrigerating compartment 11 is enhanced. Also, the appearance becomes more beautiful. Although the recess 19a to receive the water filter device 10 is provided at the storage container 19 in this embodiment, it may be formed at one side wall 16 of the refrigerating compartment 11 or may be formed at both one side wall 16 of the refrigerating compartment 11 and the storage container 19. Where the water filter device 10, which includes the storage tank unit 80, is arranged between the storage container 10 and one side wall 16 of the refrigerating compartment 11, it is unnecessary to use a separate heater to prevent water stored in a water tank from being frozen. This is because the phenomenon, in which water stored in the water tank is frozen by cold air, is reduced in this case, as compared to the case in which the water tank is arranged at a rear wall of the refrigerating compartment 11. Although the water filter device 10 of the refrigerator according to this embodiment is arranged between the storage container 19 and one side wall 16 of the refrigerating compartment 11, the present general inventive concept is not limited thereto. Where storage containers 19 are arranged in parallel at left and light sides, respectively, as shown in FIG. 13, the water filter device 10 may function as a partition wall. That is, the water filter device 10 is arranged at a central portion of the receiving space defined beneath the storage container cover 12 to receive the storage container 19. In this case, the water filter device 10 laterally divides the receiving space into space portions, to allow the storage containers 19 to be separably received in respective space portions. In this case, the space utility is further enhanced because the useless space of a partition wall to partition the storage containers 19 is occupied by the water filter device 10. In this case, guide rail 14 may be provided at opposite side surfaces of the water filter device 10 arranged between the storage containers 19, to guide movements of the storage containers 19. The case 120 is defined with a space to receive a filter unit 130 to purify water supplied from the external water supply source 5 via the supply tube 6, and a water storage tank unit 180 to store the water purified by the filter unit 130. The case 120 is formed with through holes 121 to guide the supply tube 6 and discharge tube 7 to a first inlet 152 of a filter head assembly 150, which will be described later, and a second outlet 185 of the storage tank unit 180, respectively. The filter unit 130 includes a water filter assembly 140 separably received in the case 120. The filter head assembly 150 is also included in the filter unit 130. The filter head assembly 150 is separably coupled to the water filter assembly 140. As in the previous embodiment, the water filter assembly 140 includes a filter case 141, and a filter 145 received in the filter case 141. The filter case 141 has a cylindrical structure open at one end thereof. A handle 142 is coupled to one end of the filter case 141, namely, the open end, such that the handle 142 closes the open end of the filter case 141. A coupler 143 is provided at the other end of the filter case 141. The coupler 143 is fitted in the filter head assembly 150. At an outer peripheral surface of the coupler 143, coupling protrusions 144 are provided to couple the coupler 143 with the filter head assembly 150. A first sealing member 146 is also provided at the outer peripheral surface of the coupler 143, to prevent water introduced into or discharged from the filter case 141 from leaking to the outside. The filter 145 is received in the filter case 141 through the open end of the filter case 141 in a state in which opposite ends of the filter 145 are supported by caps 147, respectively. As shown in FIGS. 6 and 7, the filter head assembly 150 includes a first body 151, a second body 161 received in the first body 151 such that the second body 161 is extendable or retractable within the first body 151, and a bracket 171 to support one-side ends of the first and second bodies 151 and 161. The first body 151 is provided with a first inlet 152 and a first inlet passage 153, through which water from the water supply source 5 is introduced. The first body 151 is also provided with a first outlet 156 and a first outlet passage 157, through which water purified by the water filter assembly 140 is discharged to the storage tank unit 180. A bypass passage 155, which communicates the first inlet passage 153 and first outlet passage 157, is also provided at the first body 151. As described above, the second body 161 is received in the first body 151 such that the second body 161 is extendable or retractable within the first body 151. The second body 161 is formed with a first communicating passage 162 to communicate the first inlet passage 153 and water filter assembly 140, and a second communicating passage 163 to communicate the first outlet passage 157 and water filter assembly 140. Valve units 165 are provided at each of the communicating passages 162 and 163. The valve units 165 function to open or close the first inlet passage 153 and first communicating passage 162, and the first outlet passage 157 and second communicating passage 163, respectively. Each valve unit 165 includes a valve stem 166, a support member 167 to support the valve stem 166, a first elastic member 168 to elastically support the valve stem 166 between the valve stem 166 and the support member 167, and a second sealing member 169 arranged around an outer peripheral surface of the valve stem 166. The first elastic member 168 elastically supports the valve stem 166 when the water filter assembly 140 is mounted to or separated from the filter head assembly 150. As described above, the bracket 171 supports one-side ends of the first and second bodies 151 and 161. A socket portion 172 is provided at each of the bracket 171 and second body 161. The coupler 143 of the water filter assembly 140 is fitted in the socket portion 172. Engagement protrusions 173 are provided at an inner peripheral surface of the socket portion 172. When the coupler 143 is rotated 90° after being fitted into the socket portion 172, the coupling protrusions 144 of the coupler 143 are engaged with the engagement protrusions 173, so that the coupler 143 is coupled to the socket portion 172. In accordance with the above-described configuration, the water filter assembly 140 is mounted to the filter head assembly 150 when the handle 142 is rotated 90° under the condition in which the water filter assembly 140 is fitted in a filter receiving portion 122 of the case 120, such that the coupling protrusions 144 of the water filter assembly 140 are engaged with the engagement protrusions 173 of the filter head assembly 150. When it is desired to replace the water filter assembly 140 with a new one, the water filter assembly 140 may be separated from the case 120 as the handle 142 is rotated in an opposite direction, and then pulled. Although the water filter assembly 140 is separably coupled to the filter head assembly 150, and the coupling is achieved by the coupling protrusions 144 and engagement protrusions 173 in this embodiment, this configuration is only an illustrative example. The coupling may be achieved using other known configurations such as a thread coupling structure, a latch structure, or a hook structure. In accordance with this embodiment, a second elastic member 175 is arranged between the first body 151 and the second body 161, as shown in FIGS. 5 and 8. When the pressure of water supplied to the water filter device 10 is low, the valve unit 165 may not operate due to the low water pressure. In this case, the second elastic member 175 functions to prevent such non-operation of the valve unit 165 caused by the low water pressure. Again referring to FIG. 5, the storage tank unit 180 includes a storage tank 181 to store water purified by the filter unit 130, and an inlet pipe 186 inserted into the storage tank 181. The storage tank 181 includes a second inlet passage 184 connected to the first outlet 156 formed at the first body 151 of the filter head assembly 150, and a second outlet 185, to which the discharge tube 7 to supply purified water to the ice maker 3 and dispenser 4 is connected. The second inlet passage 184 is provided in the form of a pipe at a bottom side of the storage tank 181 in the rear of the storage tank 181. Accordingly, the second inlet passage 184 is connected to the first outlet 156 in a fitting manner. The second outlet 185 is provided at the rear side of the storage tank 181. The first outlet 156 of the filter head assembly 150 is arranged such that it is directly connected to the second inlet passage 184 of the storage tank unit 180, in order to reduce the length of the water supply line in this embodiment of the invention. Of course, the first outlet 156 may be indirectly connected to the second inlet passage 184 via a water supply valve. In this case, purified water discharged from the first outlet 156 of the filter head assembly 150 is introduced into the water supply valve, and then supplied to the storage tank unit 180 after the water supply valve controls supply amount thereof. The storage tank 181 is divided into a storage space 182, in which water purified by the filter unit 130 is stored, and an insertion space 183, into which the inlet pipe 186 is inserted. The insertion space 183 communicates, at one end thereof, with the inlet passage 184, while communicating, at the other end thereof, with the storage space 182. That is, water discharged from the filter unit 130 is introduced into the second inlet passage 184, and is then directed to a front portion of the storage space 182 opposite to the second outlet 185 via the inlet pipe 186. In this embodiment, accordingly, water supplied to the storage tank 181 via the inlet pipe 186 is stored in the storage tank 181, starting from a front side 182a of the storage space 182. As a result, through the outlet 85 opposite to the front side 182a of the storage space 182, water already stored in the storage tank 181 in the vicinity of the outlet 85 and cooled by cold air supplied to the storage chamber is discharged such that it is supplied to the ice maker 3 and dispenser 4. The front side 182a of the storage space 182 has a round shape in order to disperse the pressure of water introduced into the storage space 182 via the inlet pipe 186, and thus to prevent the storage tank 181 from being damaged due to the water pressure. Hereinafter, a procedure of supplying water from the external water supply source to the ice maker and dispenser in accordance with the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3 will be described, with reference to FIG. 9. Water supplied from the external water supply source 5 is first introduced into the filter unit 30 via the supply tube 6. In this case, the water supplied from the external water supply source 5 may be introduced into the water filter assembly 40 because the water supply tube 6 is in a state of being connected to the inlet 52 of the filter head assembly 50. The water introduced into the water filter assembly 40 is purified by the water filter assembly 40 and then discharged through the outlet 53 of the filter head assembly 50. The water discharged through the outlet 53 is introduced into the storage tank unit 60 via the connecting tube 70. The water introduced into the storage tank unit 60 is stored in the storage tank unit 60, and then flows through the discharge tube 7. The water flowing through the discharge tube 7 is fed to the ice maker 3 and dispenser 4. Now, a procedure of supplying water from the external water supply source to the ice maker and dispenser in a state in which the water filter assembly is separated from the filter head assembly, in accordance with the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 5, will be described, with reference to FIG. 10. Water supplied from the external water supply source 5 is first introduced into the first inlet passage 153 of the filter head assembly via the supply tube 6, and then discharged through the first outlet passage 157 after passing through the bypass passage 155. In this case, as the water from the external water supply source 5 is introduced into the first inlet passage 153, the second body 161 is moved in a left direction due to the pressure of the introduced water. As a result, the bypass passage 155 is exposed or opened, thereby communicating the first inlet passage 153 and first outlet passage 157. Accordingly, the water flows from the first inlet passage 153 to the first outlet passage 157. During this procedure, the valve stem 166 of the valve unit 165 is always urged toward the water filter assembly 140, thereby closing the first and second communicating passages 162 and 163. The water discharged from the outlet passage 157 of the filter head assembly 150 is introduced into the storage tank 181. The water introduced into the storage tank unit 181 is stored in the storage tank unit 181, and then flows through the discharge tube 7. The water flowing through the discharge tube 7 is fed to the ice maker 3 and dispenser 4. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 5, a procedure of supplying water from the external water supply source to the ice maker and dispenser will also be described, with reference to FIG. 11. Water supplied from the external water supply source 5 is first introduced into the filter unit 130 via the supply tube 6. In this case, the water supplied from the external water supply source 5 may be introduced into the water filter assembly 140 via the first inlet passage 153 and first communicating passage 162 because the water supply tube 6 is in a state of being connected to the first inlet 152 of the filter head assembly 150. The water introduced into the water filter assembly 140 is purified by the water filter assembly 140, and then discharged through the first outlet 156 of the filter head assembly 150 after passing through the second communicating passage 163 and first outlet passage 157. The water discharged through the first outlet 156 of the filter head assembly 150 is introduced into the storage space 182 of the storage tank 181 via the second inlet passage 184 and inlet pipe 186 of the storage tank unit 180. In this case, the water introduced into the storage space 182 via the inlet pipe 186 is directed to the round front side of the storage space 182. Accordingly, it may be possible to prevent the storage tank 181 from being damaged due to the pressure of the supplied water. The water introduced into the storage tank 181 is stored in the storage tank 181, and then flows through the discharge tube 7. The water flowing through the discharge tube 7 is fed to the ice maker 3 and dispenser 4. In this case, water supplied to the storage tank 181 is stored in the storage tank 181, starting from a front side 182a of the storage space 182, by virtue of the inlet pipe 186. As a result, through the outlet 85 opposite to the front side 182a of the storage space 182, water already stored in the storage tank 181 in the vicinity of the outlet 85 and cooled by cold air supplied to the storage chamber is discharged. In each of the refrigerators according to the above-described embodiments, water supplied from the external water supply source 5 is supplied to the ice maker 3 and dispenser 4 after being purified by the water filter device 10, which includes the filter unit 30 or 130 and the storage tank unit 60 or 180 are held in an integrated state in the case 20 or 120. Accordingly, the water filter device 10 may achieve an improvement in assemblability and a reduction in material costs and labor costs in that the filter unit 30 or 130 and the storage tank unit 60 or 180 are held in the case 20 or 120, as compared to the conventional case in which the storage tank unit is separate from the filter unit. In the refrigerator according to one of the above-described embodiments, it may be possible to supply a water portion, cooled by cold air, of the water stored in the storage tank 181, earlier than the remaining water portion, because water is supplied to the storage tank 181 through the inlet pipe 186. In the refrigerator according to each of the above-described embodiments, it may be possible to prevent the storage tank 181 from being damaged due to the pressure of water supplied to the storage tank 181 through the inlet pipe 186, because the front side of the storage space 182 has a round shape.
