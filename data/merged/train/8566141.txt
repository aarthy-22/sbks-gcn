Amantadine induces c-fos in rat striatum: reversal with dopamine D1 and NMDA receptor antagonists.
Amantadine (1-aminoadamantane) induced Fos expression in the central, dorsal-medial and ventral-medial part of the striatum.
The distribution pattern of Fos induced by amantadine was more similar to those seen with dopaminomimetics than with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists.
Pretreatment with the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist, SCH23390, and the NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801, blocked amantadine induction of Fos in the striatum.
However, amantadine induction of Fos in the striatum was unaffected by the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, sulpiride.
These results suggest that amantadine induction of Fos in the rat striatum is related to dopamine D1 and NMDA receptors.
