FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE [0002] The compositions and methods disclosed herein relate to alkaloid compounds and to processes for manufacturing the same. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to plant alkaloids, and methods for making such alkaloids using improved polynucleotide sequences. BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE [0003] The following paragraphs are provided by way of background to the present disclosure. They are not however an admission that anything discussed therein is prior art or part of the knowledge of persons skilled in the art. [0004] Plants are capable of producing alkaloid compounds in small amounts. In general, these alkaloid compounds are relatively complex organic molecules, containing mostly basic nitrogen atoms. The in planta biosynthesis of an alkaloid compound involves the occurrence of a series of contiguous chemical reactions together constituting a so-called biosynthetic pathway. Each chemical reaction within a biosynthetic pathway is catalyzed by a different plant enzyme, and therefore alkaloid biosynthesis requires that plant enzymes and genes encoding these enzymes, act in concert within the plant cells. Well known examples of plants producing alkaloid compounds, are plants belonging to the Papaveraceae, a plant family constituting approximately 250 species and found mainly in mild and temperate regions of the world. Many alkaloid compounds have been found to have pharmacological effects and have been found useful, as medicinal compounds, as well as recreational drugs or stimulants. Examples of plant alkaloid compounds include the stimulants caffeine and nicotine, the stimulant and local anesthetic cocaine, the anti-malarial drug quinine, the analgesic morphine, the antimicrobials sanguinerine and berberine, the muscle relaxant papaverine and the cough suppressant noscapine. [0005] Currently alkaloid compounds may be harvested from natural sources, such as opium poppy. Alternatively these compounds may be prepared synthetically. The existing manufacturing methods for alkaloid compounds however suffer from low yields and/or are expensive. For example, less than 2% of exogenous (R,S)-norlaudanosoline was converted to sanguinarine via a pathway of 10 genes from opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) re-assembled in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (Fossati et al., 2014). An alternative approach to manufacturing plant alkaloid compounds would comprise marshaling a genetically modified host, e.g. a bacterial or yeast fermentation system, to produce alkaloid compounds. Such a biosynthetic system would permit inexpensive production of plant alkaloids in a tightly controlled environment. However due to the unusual complexity of the synthesis of the vast majority of desirable alkaloid compounds, methods for biosynthesis of alkaloid compounds using inexpensive nutrients and a genetically engineered host system to synthesize alkaloids from such nutrients, are not available. These complexities arise in part from the total number of separate chemical reactions included in a biosynthetic alkaloid production system. Inefficiencies in the performance of each reaction, starting from an economically available substrate, effectively are amplified along the chain of contiguous enzymes, thereby substantially compromising the yield of a final desired alkaloid product. [0006] Thus is unclear whether and how existing methodologies may be used to achieve commercial biosynthesis of plant alkaloid compounds and their derivatives. There exists therefore in the art a need for improved methods for the biosynthesis of alkaloid compounds.

Normally mRNA species have contiguous exons, with the intervening introns, when present, being removed by nuclear RNA splicing, to create a continuous open reading frame encoding the protein. [00056] The term "homologous" as used herein in reference to polynucleotides and polynucleotide sequences is intended to mean obtainable from the same biological species, i.e. a first and second polynucleotide sequence are homologous when they are obtainable from the same biological species, and conversely, a first and second polynucleotide sequence are non-homologous when they are obtainable or obtained from two different biological species.

The sequences may also contain modified bases. Examples of such modified bases include aza and deaza adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymidine and uracil, and xanthine and hypoxanthine. [00060] The term "percent sequence identity" refers to the degree of identity between any given query sequence and a subject sequence. A subject sequence typically has a length that is from about 80 percent to about 250 percent of the length of the query sequence, e.g., 82, 85, 87, 89, 90, 93, 95, 97, 99, 100, 105, 110, 115, or 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210, 220, 230, 240, or 250 percent of the length of the query sequence. A query nucleic acid or amino acid sequences is aligned to one or more subject nucleic acid or amino acid sequences using the computer program ClustalW (version 1.83, default parameters), which allows alignments of nucleic acid or protein sequences to be carried out across their entire length (global alignment). Chenna et al. (2003) Nucleic Acids Res. 31(13):3497-500. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison may be conducted by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman (1981) Add. APL. Math. 2:482, by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch (1970) J. Mol. Biol. 48:443, by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 85: 2444, by computerized implementations of algorithms such as GAP, BESTFIT, BLAST, PASTA, and TFASTA (Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group (GCG), 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.] or by inspection. Typically, the default values of 5.00 for gap weight and 0.30 for gap weight length are used. ClustalW calculates the best match between a query and one or more subject sequences, and aligns them so that identities, similarities and differences can be determined Gaps of one or more residues can be inserted into a query sequence, a subject sequence, or both, to maximize sequence alignments. For fast pairwise alignment of nucleic acid sequences, the following default parameters are used: word size: 2; window size: 4; scoring method: percentage; number of top diagonals: 4; and gap penalty: 5. For an alignment of multiple nucleic acid sequences, the following parameters are used: gap opening penalty: 10.0; gap extension penalty: 5.0; and weight transitions: yes. For fast pairwise alignment of protein sequences, the following parameters are used: word size: 1; window size: 5; scoring method: percentage; number of top diagonals: 5; gap penalty: 3. For multiple alignment of protein sequences, the following parameters are used: weight matrix: blosum; gap opening penalty: 10.0; gap extension penalty: 0.05; hydrophilic gaps: on; hydrophilic residues: Gly, Pro, Ser, Asn, Asp, Gin, Glu, Arg, and Lys; residue-specific gap penalties: on. The output is a sequence alignment that reflects the relationship between sequences. ClustalW can be run, for example, at the Baylor College of Medicine Search Launcher website and at the European Bioinformatics Institute website on the World Wide Web. To determine a percent identity for polypeptide or nucleic acid sequences between a query and a subject sequence, the sequences are aligned using Clustal W and the number of identical matches in the alignment is divided by the query length, and the result is multiplied by 100. The output is the percent identity of the subject sequence with respect to the query sequence. It is noted that the percent identity value can be rounded to the nearest tenth. For example, 78.11, 78.12, 78.13, and 78.14 are rounded down to 78.1, while 78.15, 78.16, 78.17, 78.18, and 78.19 are rounded up to 78.2. [00061] The term "substantial sequence identity" between polynucleotide or polypeptide sequences refers to polynucleotide or polypeptide comprising a sequence that has at least 80% sequence identity, preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90% and most preferably at least 95%, even more preferably, at least 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% sequence identity, however in each case less than 100%, compared to a reference polynucleotide sequence using the programs. [00062] The terms " O-methyltransferase", or "OMT", which may be used interchangeably herein, refer to any and all enzymes comprising a sequence of amino acid residues which is (i) substantially identical to the amino acid sequences constituting any OMT polypeptide set forth herein, including, for example, SEQ.ID NO: 1592, SEQ.ID NO: 1593; SEQ.ID NO: 1597; and SEQ.ID NO: 1598, or (ii) encoded by a nucleic acid sequence capable of hybridizing under at least moderately stringent conditions to any nucleic acid sequence encoding any OMT polypeptide set forth herein, but for the use of synonymous codons. [00063] The terms "N-methyltransferase", or "NMT", which may be used interchangeably herein, refer to any and all enzymes comprising a sequence of amino acid residues which is (i) substantially identical to the amino acid sequences constituting any NMT polypeptide set forth herein, including, for example, SEQ.ID NO: 1749, or (ii) encoded by a nucleic acid sequence capable of hybridizing under at least moderately stringent conditions to any nucleic acid sequence encoding any NMT polypeptide set forth herein, but for the use of synonymous codons.

[00065] In a further aspect, the herein provided method involves the preparation of a polynucleotide library from a plant. Methods to prepare such polynucleotide library may be as desired. In general, methods to prepare a polynucleotide library involve isolation of a polynucleotide fraction (e.g. a DNA fraction or an RNA fraction) from plant cells, fractionating the polynucleotide fraction into a pool of polynucleotide fragments (preferably DNA fragments), cloning the polynucleotide fragments within the pool into a vector, e.g. a plasmid or viral vector, and maintaining the cloned fragments into a host, e.g. a microbial host such as a bacterial host or a yeast cell host. The techniques and methodologies for preparing a polynucleotide library are well known to those in the art and further details may be found in Sambrook J. and Green M., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2012, Cold Spring Harbor Press. In a preferred embodiment hereof the polynucleotide library is a cDNA library prepared from a plant tissue synthesizing alkaloid compounds. Such tissue may be any plant tissue synthesizing alkaloids, including for example, plant stem tissue, bark tissue, leaf tissue, seed tissue, fruit tissue, flower tissue, root tissue, rhizome tissue or callus tissue, obtained, for example, from the hereinbefore mentioned plants. In preferred embodiments, the following tissues used in accordance herewith are: stem of Argemone mexicana (Mexican Prickly Poppy), root of Berberis thunbergii (Japanese Barberry), stem of Chelidonium majus (Greater Celandine), callus of Cissampelos mucronata (Abuta), callus of Cocculus trilobus (Korean Moonseed), root of Corydalis chelanthifolia (Ferny Fumewort), root of Eschscholzia californica (California Poppy), root of Glaucium flavum (Yellowhorn Poppy), rhizome of Hydrastis canadensis (Goldenseal), root of Jeffersonia diphylla (Rheumatism Root), bark of Mahonia aquifolium (Oregon Grape), rhizome of Menispermum canadense (Canadian Moonseed), root of Nandina domestica (Sacred Bamboo), root of Nigella sativa (Black Cumin), stem of Papaver bracteatum (Persian Poppy), rhizome of Sanguinaria canadensis (Bloodroot), stem of Stylophorum diphyllum (Celandine Poppy), root of Thalictrum flavum (Meadow Rue), callus of Tinospora cordifolia (Heartleaf Moonseed) or root of Xanthoriza simplicissima (Yellowroot). [00066] In a further aspect, the herein provided methods involve the determination of the nucleic acid sequence of the polynucleotide fragments in the pools of polynucleotides. Methods to determine the sequences of polynucleotides may be as desired and are well known to the art in include for example Sanger sequencing, GS-FLX Titanium (Roche) sequencing and GA/HiSeq sequencing (Illumina). The latter two are particularly desirable as they provide for high throughput. [00067] In a further aspect, the herein provided methods involve the identification and isolation of candidate polynucleotides from the pools of sequenced polynucleotides. In accordance herewith, this is achieved by comparing a polynucleotide sequence which is known to be involved in the synthesis of alkaloid compounds, i.e. a query sequence, to the sequences of the polynucleotides in the polynucleotide sequences present in the pools, and determining which sequences among the pools of sequenced polynucleotide sequences are substantially identical to the query sequence. The approach to determining substantial identity may vary, but generally involves determining the percentage identity between the query polynucleotide sequence and the polynucleotide sequences in the pools using in general the methodologies hereinbefore described (see: terms and definitions] and identifying such of the sequences that are substantially identical to the sequence of the query polynucleotide. In an alternate approach, substantial identity may also be established by deriving the polypeptide sequence from the polynucleotide sequence (using the known rules for codon use) and comparing a query polypeptide sequence with the sequences in the pool. In accordance herewith, the polynucleotide sequences in the pools that show substantial sequence identity are candidate polynucleotide sequences, which are subsequently isolated from the pools of polynucleotide sequences. In some cases, part coding sequences may be identified and it may be necessary to identify overlapping polynucleotides in order to identify the full-length polynucleotide sequence. Polynucleotide sequences that may be used as query sequences include any polynucleotide sequences known to be involved in the synthesis of any alkaloid. Examples of enzymes encoding such polynucleotide sequences are provided in TABLE 1 hereto. In accordance herewith, in particularly preferred embodiments, the polynucleotide sequences used in accordance herewith include polynucleotide sequences encoding N-methyltransferases (see: Examples 2 and 3), or O-methyltransferases (see: Examples 4, 5, 6 and 7) [00068] In a further aspect, the present disclosure involves evaluating the production of an alkaloid compound using a system that permits the quantitative measurement of the alkaloid compound synthesized using the candidate polynucleotides. In general, the identified candidate polynucleotide sequences may be cloned into an expression vector and introduced into a host cell, which may be any microbial cell, e.g. a bacterial cell or a yeast cell, plant cell or animal cell. Upon such introduction the production of the alkaloid may be evaluated either in vitro or in vivo. In vitro evaluation may be performed by isolating the enzyme in more or less pure form from the host e.g. by evaluating a cellular fraction (e.g. in the case of yeast, a microsome fraction) obtainable from the host cell comprising the enzyme, incubating the enzyme fraction with its alkaloid substrate and assaying for the alkaloid product. In vivo evaluation may be performed by providing to the host cell a substrate or potential substrate alkaloid to the enzyme encoded by the candidate polynucleotide and evaluating the in vivo production of the product alkaloid. The enzyme conversion rate and/or the substrate specificity for a substrate or potential substrate may be determined qualitatively or quantitatively using enzyme assays. Quantitative determination includes, for example, determining the percentage of substrate converted, or determining key catalytic properties of an enzyme such as the kcat and/or Km of an enzyme. Methodologies to evaluate the production of an alkaloid compound in a quantitative fashion in accordance herewith will be generally known to those of skill in the art, and include for example liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The production of the alkaloid by different candidate polynucleotides and/or the query polynucleotide may be compared. [00069] In one aspect, in accordance herewith, from the candidate polynucleotides a polynucleotide providing an improved amount of the alkaloid compound in the expression system is selected. In preferred embodiments, the selected polynucleotide is a polynucleotide conveying higher levels of production of the target alkaloid compound than those provided by the query polynucleotide and/or by those observed using the query polynucleotide. [00070] In further embodiments, a polynucleotide encoding an enzyme having narrow substrate specificity is selected. The term "narrow substrate specificity" as used herein refers to an enzyme capable of substantially converting no more than 3, or no more than 2 different alkaloid substrates. The term "substantially converting" as used herein refers to an enzyme capable of converting 90% or more, or 95% or more of that substrate to a single product. [00071] In further embodiments, a polynucleotide encoding a substantially specific alkaloid biosynthetic enzyme is selected. The term "substantially specific alkaloid biosynthetic enzyme" as used herein refers to an enzyme which when presented with an alkaloid substrate under assay conditions is capable of converting 90% or more, or 95% or more of that substrate to an alkaloid product, and when presented with other alkaloid substrates under the same assay conditions is capable of converting no more than 20%, 15%, 10% or 5% of such other alkaloid substrates. Thus, for example, an O-methyltransferase capable of converting 99% of a first benzylisoquinoline when presented therewith, and 10%, 5% and 0%, of a second, third and fourth benzylisoquinoline, respectively, when presented with these compounds, is a substantially specific alkaloid biosynthetic enzyme. Conversely, an O-methyltransferase capable of converting 99% of a first benzylisoquinoline when presented therewith, and 75%, 5% and 0%, of a second, third and fourth benzylisoquinoline, respectively, when presented with these compounds is not a substantially specific alkaloid biosynthetic enzyme. [00072] In additional embodiments, the methods herein provided are conducted in an iterative fashion for the purpose of identifying two or more improved polynucleotide sequences encoding enzymes capable of converting two or more alkaloid compounds in an alkaloid synthesis pathway, for example, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more polynucleotides, each encoding a different enzyme in the same alkaloid biosynthesis pathway. In further embodiments, at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 polynucleotides are selected, each polynucleotide encoding an enzyme that has narrow substrate specificity. In further embodiments, at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 polynucleotides are selected, each polynucleotide encoding a substantially specific alkaloid biosynthetic enzyme. Thus a plurality of improved polynucleotides may be identified and each of these improved polynucleotides may be evaluated in conjunction with one or more other improved polynucleotides. In this manner, the alkaloid synthesis pathway may be improved, and improved levels of an alkaloid compound may be obtained. Levels of alkaloid compound production that may be obtained using the improved polynucleotides of the present disclosure in combination with a recombinant host cell system are typically at least 1.5X in excess of the level of the levels of the alkaloid compound produced in a natural system, and in some embodiments at least 2X, 5X, or at least 10X in excess of the levels of the alkaloid compound produced in a natural system. [00073] The present disclosure further includes novel polynucleotides capable of producing an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of alkaloid compounds. These polynucleotides include the polynucleotide sequences set forth in SEQ.ID NO: 1 - SEQ.ID NO: 870. [00074] In accordance with a further aspect of the present disclosure, included herein are methods for the production of alkaloid compounds in a host cell.

[00075] In preferred embodiments hereof, the alkaloid levels produced using the non-homologous polynucleotides are at least 1.5X in excess of the levels produced using homologous polynucleotides, in more preferred embodiments at least 2X, at least 5X or at least 10X in excess. In further preferred embodiments, the first and second polynucleotide are a polynucleotide encoding any one of the polypeptides set forth in SEQ.ID NO: 871 to SEQ.ID NO: 1749. [00076] In further preferred embodiments hereof, the first and second polynucleotide sequences have been obtained by comparing the production of an alkaloid compound in a cell using a plurality of polynucleotides encoding an enzyme capable of catalyzing a chemical reaction converting a first alkaloid compound into a second alkaloid embodiment, and selecting the polynucleotide providing the highest levels of the second alkaloid compound. In preferred embodiments, such selection is performed by: a) providing a plurality of plant species capable of synthesizing an alkaloid compound; (b) preparing a polynucleotide library from each of the plant species, each polynucleotide library comprising a pool of polynucleotides; (c) determining the nucleic acid sequences of the polynucleotides in each of the pools of polynucleotides; (d) isolating a plurality of candidate polynucleotides from the pools of polynucleotides by comparing the nucleic acid sequence of a polynucleotide known to be involved in the synthesis of an alkaloid compound with the nucleic acid sequences of the polynucleotides in the pools, and identifying a plurality of candidate polynucleotides, each of which comprises a nucleic acid sequence substantially identical to the nucleic acid sequence of the polynucleotide known to be involved in the synthesis of alkaloid compounds; (e) evaluating synthesis of an alkaloid compound using an expression system that permits the quantitative measurement of the alkaloid compound synthesized using the candidate polynucleotides; and (f) selecting from the candidate polynucleotides a polynucleotide providing an improved amount of the alkaloid compound in the expression system. [00077] Polynucleotides capable of controlling expression in host cells that may be used herein include any transcriptional promoter capable of controlling expression of polypeptides in host cells. Generally, promoters obtained from bacterial cells are used when a bacterial host is selected in accordance herewith, while a fungal promoter will be used when a fungal host is selected, a plant promoter will be used when a plant cell is selected, and so on. Further polynucleotide elements capable elements of controlling expression in a host cell include transcriptional terminators, enhancers and the like, all of which may be included in the chimeric polynucleotides of the present disclosure. [00078] In accordance with the present disclosure, the chimeric polynucleotides can be integrated into a recombinant expression vector, which ensures good expression in a host cell. Accordingly, the present disclosure includes a recombinant expression vector comprising in the 5' to 3' direction of transcription as operably linked components: (Q a first polynucleotide capable of controlling expression in a host cell; (ii) a first polynucleotide obtainable from a first plant capable of producing an alkaloid compound encoding a first enzyme capable of catalyzing a chemical reaction that converts a first alkaloid compound into a second alkaloid compound; (iii) a second polynucleotide capable of controlling expression in a host cell; and (iv) a second polynucleotide obtainable from a second plant capable of producing an alkaloid compound encoding a second enzyme capable of catalyzing a chemical reaction that converts the second alkaloid compound into a third alkaloid compound. wherein the expression vector is suitable for expression in a host cell. The term "suitable for expression in a host cell" means that the recombinant expression vector comprises the chimeric polynucleotide of the present disclosure linked to genetic elements required to achieve expression in a host cell. Genetic elements that may be included in the expression vector in this regard include a transcriptional termination region, one or more polynucleotides encoding marker genes, one or more origins of replication and the like. In preferred embodiments, the expression vector further comprises genetic elements required for the integration of the vector or a portion thereof in the host cell's genome, for example if a plant host cell is used the T-DNA left and right border sequences which facilitate the integration into the plant's nuclear genome. [00079] Pursuant to the present disclosure, the expression vector may further contain a marker gene. Marker genes that may be used in accordance with the present disclosure include all genes that allow the distinction of transformed cells from non-transformed cells, including all selectable and screenable marker genes. A marker gene may be a resistance marker such as an antibiotic resistance marker against, for example, kanamycin or ampicillin.

Nos. 5,268,463 and 5,599,670) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Niedz et al., 1995, Plant Cell Rep., 14: 403). [00080] One host cell that particularly conveniently may be used is Escherichia coli. The preparation of the E. coli vectors may be accomplished using commonly known techniques such as restriction digestion, ligation, gelectrophoresis, DNA sequencing, the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and other methodologies. A wide variety of cloning vectors is available to perform the necessary steps required to prepare a recombinant expression vector. Among the vectors with a replication system functional in E. coli, are vectors such as pBR322, the pUC series of vectors, the M13 mp series of vectors, pBluescript etc. Typically, these cloning vectors contain a marker allowing selection of transformed cells. Nucleic acid sequences may be introduced in these vectors, and the vectors may be introduced in E. coli by preparing competent cells, electroporation or using other well known methodologies to a person of skill in the art. E. coli may be grown in an appropriate medium, such as Luria-Broth medium and harvested. Recombinant expression vectors may readily be recovered from cells upon harvesting and lysing of the cells.

EXAMPLES [000128] Hereinafter are provided examples of specific embodiments of the present disclosure, as well as embodiments representing the compositions of the present disclosure. The examples are provided for illustrative purposes only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure in any way. Example 1 - Isolation of cDNA candidate polynucleotides from 20 plant species [000129] The Trizol method was used to extract total RNA from plant organs and tissues (Chomczynski and Sacchi, 1987). When the polysaccharide and polyphenolic content was high, such as in roots or rhizomes, a modified CTAB method was used (Desgagne-Penix et al., 2010). The quality and quantity of isolated total RNA were evaluated on the basis of UV absorption ratios (i.e. 260/280 nm and 260/230 nm). All the samples showed a 260/280 nm ratio of between 1.9 and 2.1, and a 260/230 nm ratio in the range of 2.0 to 2.5. [000130] Poly(A)+ RNA purification, cDNA library preparation, emulsion- based PCR (emPCR) and sequencing was performed at the McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Centre (Montreal, Canada). The RNA content in all samples was quantified using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). RNA samples were further analyzed using an RNA 6000 Nano chip on a BioAnalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies) to validate RNA quality. Only samples with a BioAnalyzer RNA Integrity Number (RIN) of 7.5 or greater were used for sequencing. Poly(A)+ RNA was purified from 2O-40 μg of total RNA by two rounds of selection using oligo (dT) attached to magnetic beads and a Dynabeads mRNA Purification kit (Invitrogen). The cDNA libraries for Roche-454 pyrosequencing were constructed from 200 ng of mRNA using a cDNA Rapid Library kit (Roche) and subsequently amplified by emPCR as per the manufacturer's instructions. After amplification, the DNA carrying beads for each library were loaded onto one- half of a PicoTiterPlate and subjected to Roche-454 GS-FLX Titanium pyrosequencing. Image and signal processing of the raw output data was performed using GS Run Processor. Sequence reads with high-quality scores were written into Standard Flowgram Format (SFF) files. [000131] The cDNA libraries for Illumina GA sequencing were constructed from 10 μg of total RNA using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The quality and average length of cDNAs in each library were determined using a High Sensitivity DNA (Agilent Technologies) chip on a 2100 Bioanalyzer. For Illumina GA sequencing, 7 pmol of each library containing cDNA with lengths from 600 to 1200 base pairs (bp) were loaded into one lane of the flow cell to generate approximately 750,000 clusters per mm2. HCS 1.4 and CASAVA 1.6-1.8 suite were used to obtain base calls and raw fastq reads. [000132] Quality scores and header information were extracted from SFF files generated from the 454 data. The pre-processing pipeline included several cleaning procedures, including clipping of adapter/primer sequences and window-based trimming of reads with Phred quality scores of less than 22. Low- complexity regions, including homopolymers were masked along with repeat regions identified based on similarity to the following: the RepBasel4 database (Jurka et l., 2005], the Viridiplantae subset of NCBI reference sequences (Refseq), and the TIGR plant repeat database (Ouyang and Buell, 2004). Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and ribosomal protein reference sets for related species were downloaded from NCBI and SILVA databases (Pruesse et al., 2007). Reads identified as rRNA and ribosomal protein sequences, and those shorter than 100 bp (not including masked regions) were removed from each 454 database. The Scylla component of the Paracel Filtering Package (PFP) (Paracel Inc, Pasadena, CA) was used to perform these steps. [000133] Initial quality assessment for Illumina GA sequence data was based on FastQC fhttp://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/proiects/fastqcl statistics, and Cutadapt (Martin and Wang, 2011) was used for adapter/primer trimming. Trimmed reads were further subjected to quality score conversion, trimming of reads with Phred quality scores of less than 25, and removal of read pairs with at least one member shorter than 35 bp using scripts written in-house. Read were also trimmed at the 5' end by 12-14 bp to account for bias associated with random priming. rRNA and ribosomal protein content was monitored by mapping the raw reads against the reference sets downloaded from NCBI and SILVA databases. No filtering step was applied if the composition was not substantial. [000134] For 454 GS-FLX sequencing, assemblies of cleaned 454 sequence data were generated using MIRA (version 3.2) (Chevreux et al. 2004). The preprocessing functions in MIRA (Chevreux et al. 2004) were disabled and analyses were performed using the 'accurate' setting. Other de novo assemblers, Paracel Transcript Assembler (Paracel Inc), CLC assembly cell (CLC bio, Cambridge MA), and Newbler v2.3 (Margulies et al., 2005) were also evaluated by comparing assembly statistics. MIRA produced the largest number of contigs over 1000 bp using the highest proportion of 454 reads. [000135] Short-read Illumina GA data were assembled using Velvet-Oases vO.1.16 (Zerbino and Birney, 2008). Optimal assembly of contigs in each database and representing a wide dynamic range of gene expression was acquired using a combined k-mer assembly approach. The pipeline generated eight parallel Oases runs for each paired-end read set using incremental k-mer settings increasing by units of 5 between 37 to 67. The generation of multiple copies of similar transcripts was expected among the different k-mer runs when merging the eight assemblies. The clustering tool CD-HIT-EST (Li and Godzik, 2006) was used to reduce redundancy by clustering nearly identical (greater than 99%) transcripts and extracting the longest representative within each cluster. The non-redundant pool of transcripts was further assembled using CAP3 (Huang and Madan, 1999) to combine contigs with significant overlaps (minimum 95% identity over at least 50 bp). Final assemblies were completed after contigs of less than 300 bp were discarded. [000136] Annotation of the 20 assembled transcriptome datasets was performed using the Magpie Automated Genomics Project Investigation Environment (MAGPIE) (Gaasterland and Sensen, 1996). MAGPIE automates sequence similarity searches against major public and internal target databases. TimeLogic Decypher Biocomputing systems (http: / /www.timelogic.com) were used to significantly accelerate similarity searches. Specifically, the TimeLogic Tera-BLAST algorithm was used to compare transcripts to the NCBI databases NR (non-redundant) and the viridiplantae subset of RefSeq (Pruitt et ah, 2007). An expected e-value of le-3 and a minimum alignment length of 30 bp were used. To obtain motif-level information, accelerated Hidden Markov Model (HMM) searches were performed against local instances of Interpro HMM libraries at an e-value of le-10. The NCBI Conserved Domain Database (CDD) was also queried using RPS- BLAST for additional annotation information. [000137] To coordinate all search results for each contig, MAGPIE ranked individual hits into three tiers of confidence. For BLAST results, e-value cutoffs were set at le-35, le-15, and le-5 for evidence levels 1, 2 and 3 respectively. For HMM results, e-value cutoffs were le-20, le-14 and le-10 at percentage similarity requirements of 65, 45 and 25%, respectively. Putative functional descriptions were assigned to each contig by performing a weighted summary of search result annotations. Summaries were based on word frequency, lexical complexity and word length, in addition to the level and type of evidence, and the taxonomic distance between the subject and the query species. GO annotations and EC numbers were compiled from GIDs extracted from level-1 evidence and attached to individual contigs as additional functional information. Contigs were subsequently cross-mapped to one another based on common GO terms and level- 1 evidence. As a step towards the incorporation of metabolomics data, putative transcript data was mapped to KEGG metabolic pathways based on EC numbers. A summary page holding all evidence and annotation was generated for each contig in MAGPIE. [000138] Annotated contigs were available for further analysis after the assembly and annotation of each sequence dataset. ESTScan (Lottaz et al., 2003) is a statistical hidden Markov model (HMM) program that can be used to discover patterns and was used for CDS detection. A refined HMM model was built using a set of full-length coding sequences for training. To determine the training set, the annotation evidence for each contig within an assembly was examined on all six open reading frames. The frame with the longest length of annotated sequence was scanned further. If the length of annotation within the selected frame was greater than 75% of the original contig length and contained putative start and stop codons, this frame was saved as a training set member. To ensure that the selected CDS has the maximum possible length, another scan was extended to flanking regions to search for possible start and stop codons. [000139] After the double scanning was applied to every contig in an assembly, a set of putative full-length coding sequences was collected. This full- length coding sequence dataset was used to train ESTScan to build the HMM model (Iseli et al., 1999). After building the model, ESTScan was applied again to predict a putative CDS for every contig of the assembly. The CDS dataset from ESTScan could contain partial coding regions; thus, scanning of the original contig and annotation was repeated for every CDS generated. When both start and stop codons were found in the original contig and the annotation was longer than 75% of the original contig length, this putative CDS was retained as a full-length putative CDS. In contrast, partial putative coding regions were removed. The full- length putative CDS dataset was then combined with the full-length coding region dataset used to train the HMM model. Duplicated sequences were removed to generate the final predicted CDS dataset. To conservatively estimate the intersect between predicted full-length CDS sets generated by 454 and Illumina, Mega BLAST (Zhang et al, 2000) was used to compare respective sets at an e-value cutoff of 0. [000140] Gene expression levels were determined by quantifying the observed read abundance. Raw read counts were extracted from assembly files for each contig in the case of the 454 assemblies. For Illumina GA data, counts were estimated by re-mapping raw short reads to the assembled contigs using Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009). The RNA-Seq by Expectation-Maximization (RSEM) package (Li and Dewey, 2011) was used to resolve ambiguous mappings and to perform final quantifications. Only paired-end reads that mapped to a common contig were considered. Normalization was done by calculating FP M values (Fragments Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped reads) for each contig. Example 2 - Isolating cDNA candidate polynucleotides encoding N- methyltransferases involved in benzylisoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis [000141] More than 2,500 BIAs, many of which possess potent pharmacological properties, have been identified in plants belonging mostly to the families Papaveraceae, Ranunculaceae, Berberidaceae and Menispermaceae (Ziegler and Facchini, 2008). Many of the enzymes involved in BIA biosynthesis have been identified from a limited number of plants including opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) and Japanese goldthread (Coptis japonica), yet the majority of catalysts responsible for the immense structural diversity of BIAs in other plants have not been characterized. Tapping into the vast biosynthetic potential of plants requires access to genes from a variety of species. The transcriptome databases from 20 BIA-producing species represent such a repository of unique biosynthetic genes responsible for the diverse alkaloid content of these plants. Based on the categorization of known BIA biosynthetic enzymes into discrete protein families (e.g. cytochromes P450, 0- and N-methyltransferases, various NADPH-dependent reductases, FAD-linked oxidoreductases, acyl-CoA-dependent acetyltransferases and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases) numerous orthologous and paralogous candidate genes can be selected from these databases for functional characterization. [000142] The utility of NGS-based transcriptome databases from related plant species for the identification of novel biosynthetic enzymes is shown by focusing on N-methylation as a common functional group modification in BIA metabolism. Three alkaloid type-specific N-methyltransferases (NMTs) have been been characterized: coclaurine N-methyltransferase (CNMT), tetrahydroprotoberberine N-methyltransferase (TNMT) and pavine N-methyltransferase (PavNMT) (FIG. 1] (Liscombe et al., 2009). (+)-Magnoflorine is an antimicrobial alkaloid produced in several plant species via the iV-methylation of (S)-corytuberine (Minami et al., 2008). Although the enzyme responsible for the formation of the quaternary ammonium in (+)-magnoflorine has not been identified (Fig. 1), CNMT from Coptis japonica was reported to N-methylate a broad range of substrates including corytuberine (Minami et al., 2008). Among the 20 BIA-producing plant species listed in TABLES 2-4, Glaucium flavum is known to accumulate substantial quantities of (+)-magnoflorine (Novak and Slavik, 1974) suggesting that an efficient corytuberine N-methyltransferase is represented among the ΝΜΤ homologs in the transcriptome database for this plant. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using predicted amino acid sequences of the ΝΜΤ homologs from all 20 BIA-producing species (TABLES 2-4) and several functionally characterized NMTs from related plants (FIG. 2). Six full-length paralogs distributed in three different NMT subclades were identified from the G. flavum 454 and Illumina GA sequence databases. Based on the extensive sequence similarity, most of the candidate genes are expected to encode NMTs involved in BIA metabolism. However, empirical enzyme characterization is required to confirm precise catalytic function. For example, GfNMTl is the most likely CNMT functional ortholog in G. flavum, GfNMT2 and GfNMT3 are expected to exhibit TNMT activities with unique or overlapping substrate preferences, and GfNMT4 could function as a PavNMT (FIG. 2). In contrast, the predicted amino acid sequences of GfNMT5 and GfNMT6 are sufficiently distinct to suggest unique substrate specificities. Considering that (SJ-corytuberine exhibits structurally similarity to the CNMT substrate (S)-coclaurine, GfNMT5 or GfNMT6 are candidates for a predicted corytuberine JV-methyltransferase in G. flavum (FIG. 1). Gene triage is conducted for selecting priority candidates from large gene families. Example 3 - Confirming an improved polynucleotide sequence encoding N- methyltransferases involved in benzylisoquinoline alkaloid synthesis [000143] Less than 2% of exogenous (R,5)-norlaudanosoline was converted to sanguinarine via a pathway of 10 genes from opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) re-assembled in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (Fossati et al., 2014). An improvement in the conversion efficiency of the pathway can be achieved by substituting one or more specific opium poppy genes, with similar variants or known or unknown function from another plant species. More specifically, the opium poppy enzymes cheilanthifoline synthase (CYP719A25) and stylopine synthase (CYP719A20) can be replaced with SEQ.ID NO: 262 and SEQ.ID NO: 264, respectively, with the resulting yeast strain demonstrating an improvement in the conversion of exogenous (R,S)-norlaudanosoline to sanguinarine. Similarly, opium poppy tetrahydroprotoberberine c\s-N- methyltransferase (TNMT) can be replaced with SEQ.ID NO: 445, resulting in further improvement in the conversion efficiency of the yeast strain. [000144] Mining of transcriptome databases for the selected plant species generates hundreds of biosynthetic genes encoding enzymes with novel catalytic activities and variants with similar functions, but different biochemical features. Genes encoding variants display improved expression characteristics in plants and microorganisms, providing metabolic engineering options for the optimization of synthetic biosystems designed to produce high-value plant metabolites. The use of this technology, employing various combinations and permutations of biosynthetic genes to engineer multi-step biosynthetic pathways in microorganisms, also accelerates the discovery of novel enzymes, and the reconstruction and optimization of natural and unnatural product pathways based on combinatorial biochemistry. [000145] Various studies have partially reconstituted other plant natural product pathways in Escherichia coli or yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae) leading to the formation of taxadiene, a key isoprenoid intermediate in taxol biosynthesis, amorphadiene, the sesquiterpene olefin precursor to artemisinin (Martin et al., 2003), artemisinic acid, the immediate precursor to artemisinin (Ro et al., 2008), the diterpene fragrance precursors cis-abienol (Zerbe et al., 2012) and sclareol (Caniard et al., 2012). Nevertheless, the deployment of most plant metabolic pathways in microbial hosts still requires the isolation and functional characterization of many unknown biosynthetic genes. Even when all biosynthetic genes required for the formation of a specific compound have been isolated from one plant and reconstituted in a microorganism, the specific catalytic characteristics of each enzyme can be inappropriate for the efficient operation of the metabolic pathway in a heterologous system. In such cases, the overall metabolic flux will be limited by the enzyme step with the lowest catalytic efficiency. The availability of enzyme variants from a wide variety of plant species, as described in this disclosure, provides a possible empirical solution to such metabolic engineering bottlenecks. Example 4 - Identifying cDNA candidate polynucleotides encoding O- methyltransferases involved in benzylisoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis [000146] Libraries containing cDNA sequences of 20 BIA-producing plant species were prepared and sequenced as described in Example 1. Within these libraries seven homologues of characterized O-methyltransferases (OMTs) involved in BIA biosynthesis were isolated from assembled 454 and Illumina GA databases (Xiao et al, 2013) of Glaucium flavum (GFLOMTs). The candidate selection strategy was based on a cutoff of 35% overall amino acid sequence identity with at least one functionally characterized OMT involved in BIA biosynthesis. Phylogenetic analysis showed that GFLOMT1-4 and GFLOMT6 formed separate clades with known OMTs (FIG. 3), whereas GFLOMT5 and GFL0MT7 formed a new clade. GFL0MT1 shares 77 and 71% amino acid sequence identities with Ps4'OMT2 from opium poppy and Cj4'OMT from Coptis japonica, respectively. GFLOMT2 shows 80 and 70% sequence identities with Ps60MT from opium poppy and Cj60MT from C. japonica, respectively. GFLOMT3 shares 63% sequence identities with Ps70MT from opium poppy and GFL0MT4 shows 38% sequence identity with CjCoOMT from C. japonica. GFLOMT6 shares 60 and 63% sequence identities with PsSOMT from opium poppy and CjSOMT from C. japonica, respectively. In contrast, GFLOMT5 and GFL0MT7 display only 42 and 44% sequence identity with the nearest neighbor CjSOMT from C. japonica, respectively. Example 5 - Expression of O-methyltransferases [000147] Full-length cDNAs for the seven GFLOMT candidates (see: Example 6] were cloned into the pRSETA expression vector with an N-terminal His-tag translational fusion and expressed in E. coli. Recombinant GFLOMTs were purified from total protein extracts using a cobalt-affinity resin. All purified recombinant enzymes displayed molecular weight values corresponding to expected protein sizes, as determined by SDS-PAGE (FIG. 4) Example 6 - Substrate specificity of O-methyltransferases [000148] Substrate specificity of the seven FLOMT's was assessed using a range of different alkaloid substrates, notably (R, S)-norlaudanosine; (fl, S]-6-0- Methylnorlaudanosoline; (R, 5 -6-O-Methyllaudanosoline; (R, S)-Norreticuline; (S)- Reticuline; (fi, S)-Scoulerine; and ( ?, 5)-Tetrahydrocolumbamine. Results are shown in TABLE 5. In the presence of SAM, GFLOMTl showed differential activity with all seven substrates. Norlaudanosoline was the preferred substrate displaying 96% conversion in the standard OMT assay, however, 6-O- methylnorlaudanosoline (87%) and 6-O-methyllaudanosoline (68%) were also efficiently converted. Scoulerine (32%), tetrahydrocolumbamine (19%), and reticuline (6%) were also accepted, but with relatively lower conversion efficiencies. Norlaudanosoline was also the best substrate for GFL0MT2 (100%), whereas 6-O-methylnorlaudanosoline (1%) and 6-O-methyllaudanosoline (14%) were not efficiently converted. In further contrast to GFLOMTl, scoulerine (75%), tetrahydrocolumbamine (32%), and reticuline (22%) were accepted with relatively higher conversion efficiencies. Scoulerine was the preferred substrate for GFL0MT6 (100%), with reticuline (97%) and tetrahydrocolumbamine (90%) also efficiently converted, and norreticuline (36%) and 6-O-methyllaudanosoline (23%) accepted at moderate levels. GFLOMT6 did not accept norlaudanosoline or 6-O-methylnorlaudanosoline. GFL0MT7 showed relatively low activity with scoulerine (12%) and tetrahydrocolumbamine (8%), but did not accept other BIAs. GFLOMT3, GFLOMT45, and GFLOMT5 did not show activity with any of the tested substrates. Kinetic analyses with preferred substrates yielding single reaction products showed that the three most effective GFLOMTs followed the Michaelis-Menton model. GFLOMT1 exhibited a Km of 12 μΜ for 6-O- methylnorlaudanosoline, GFLOMT2 showed a Km of 15 μΜ for norlaudanosoline, GFLOMT6 showed a Km of 22 μΜ for scoulerine, Catalytic efficiencies (kCat/Km) were relatively high for all three conversions. Example 7 - In-vitro reaction products formed by O-methyltransferases [000149] The reaction products formed using GFLOMT1, GFL0MT2, GFL0MT6 and GFLOMT7 were analyzed. Enzyme assays were subjected to positive-mode electrospray ionization (ESI[+]) LC-MS/MS for reaction product characterization, including collision-induced dissociation (CID) fragmentation analysis. ESI[+]-CID of 1-benzylisoquinoline and protoberberine alkaloids at low ionization energy yields isoquinoline and/or benzyl moieties as major ion fragments. Using the ESI[+]-CID spectra of authentic standards (TABLE 6), the identity of recombinant GFLOMT reaction products was determined (TABLE 7). Positions of new O-methyl groups could be inferred from the increased m/z (in multiples of 14 Da) of dissociated isoquinoline and benzyl ion fragments even in the absence of authentic standards, although most were available. GFLOMT1 [000150] Incubation of GFLOMT1 with norlaudanosoline (m/z 288) yielded two major peaks with m/z 302 at 2.62 min and m/z 316 at 2.95 min (FIG. 5A), suggesting single and double O-methylation events, respectively. The parent ion of m/z 302 produced an ESI[+]-CID spectrum corresponding to authentic 6-O- methylnorlaudanosoline, whereas the parent ion of m/z 316 produced an ESI[+]- CID spectrum matching that of norreticuline. Assays containing GFLOMT1 and 6- O-methylnorlaudanosoline (m/z 302) generated major and minor products oi m/z 316 and m/z 330, with ESI[+]-CID spectra corresponding to norreticuline and norcodamine, respectively (FIG. 5B). Although an authentic standard for norcodamine was not available, compound identity could be inferred. Compared with the ESI[+]-CID spectrum of 6-O-methylnorlaudanosoline, which displays the fragment ions m/z 178 (isoquinoline moiety) and m/z 123 (benzyl moiety), the m/z 330 reaction product yielded major fragment ions of m/z 178 and m/z 151 (increase of 28 Da), the latter of which corresponds to a 3- and 4-O-methylated benzyl moiety. Incubation of GFL0MT1 with 6-O-methyllaudanosoline (m/z 316) yielded major and minor products with m/z 330 at 2.99 min and m/z 344 at 3.17 min, corresponding to single and double O-methylation events, respectively (FIG. 5C). The m/z-330 parent ion produced an ESI[+]-CID spectrum corresponding to authentic reticuline, whereas the double O-methylated m/z-344 parent ion yielded an ESI[+]-CID spectrum matching that of codamine. In assays containing GFLOMT1 and reticuline, a minor product of m/z 344 with an ESI[+]-CID spectrum corresponding codamine was also produced (FIG. 5D). The major and minor products resulting from the incubation of GFL0MT1 with scoulerine showed parent masses of m/z 342 and m/z 356, with ESI[+]-CID spectra corresponding to tetrahydropalmatrubine and tetrahydropalmatine (FIG. 5E). An authentic standard for tetrahydropalmatrubine was not available, however, product identification was inferred from the 14-Da increase in the isoquinoline moiety of scoulerine (m/z 178) to m/z 192. In assays containing GFL0MT1 and tetrahydrocolumbine a minor product was generated with a parent mass of m/z 356 and an ESI| +J-CID spectrum corresponding to tetrahydropalmatine (FIG. SF). GFLOMT2 [000151] GFL0MT2 efficiently converted norlaudanosoline (m/z 288) to a product with m/z 302, which yielded an ESI[+]-CID spectrum corresponding to 6- O-methylnorlaudanosoline (FIG. 6A). In contrast, GFLOMT2 incubated with 6-O- methylnorlaudanosoline generated a minor product with m/z 316 (FIG. 6B), which was inferred as nororientaline based on the detection of major fragment ions of m/z 178 (isoquinoline moiety) and m/z 137 (3'-O-methylated benzyl moiety). The different retention time compared with norreticuline (i.e. A'-O- methylated 6-O-methylnorlaudanosoline) confirmed 3'- rather than 4'-O- methylation. Incubation of GFLOMT2 with 6-O-methyllaudanosoline (m/z 316) yielded three products with m/z 330 at 2.85 min, m/z 330 at 2.98 min, and m/z 344 at 3.15 min, indicating both single and double O-methylation events (FIG. 6C). The identity of the m/z-330 parent ion at 2.85 min was inferred as orientaline based on the detection of major fragment ions of m/z 192 (isoquinoline moiety) and m/z 137 (3'-O-methylated benzyl moiety). The different retention time compared with reticuline (i.e. 4'-O-methyIated 6-O-methyllaudanosoline and the m/z-330 parent ion at 2.98 min) confirmed 3'- rather than 4'-O-methylation. The double O-methylation product corresponded to a parent ion of m/z-344 parent ion yielded an ESl[+]-CID spectrum corresponding to codamine. The minor GFLOMT2 reaction product with reticuline showed a parent mass of m/z 344 and ESI[+] -CID spectrum corresponding to codamine (FIG. 6D). Incubation of GFLOMT2 with scoulerine (m/z 328) yielded major and minor products with m/z 342 and m/z 356, identified as tetrahydropalmatrubine and tetrahydropalmatine, respectively (FIG. 6E). The reaction product of GFLOMT2 incubated with tetrahydrocolumbine showed a parent mass of m/z 356, which was also identified as tetrahydropalmatine (FIG. 6F). FLQMT6 [000152] Incubation of GFLOMT6 with 6-O-methyllaudanosoline (m/z 316) yielded a reaction product with m/z 330 (FIG. 7A), which was inferred as 6,7-0,O- dimethyllaudanosoline based on ESI[+]-CID spectrum and a unique retention time. Compared with the ESI[+]-CID spectrum of 6-O-methyllaudanosoline, which shows major fragment ions of m/z 192 and m/z 123, the m/z 330 product yielded fragment ions of m/z 206 (7-O-methylated isoquinoline moiety) and m/z 123 (unchanged benzyl moiety). Incubation of GFLOMT6 with norreticuline (m/z 316) yielded two major and one minor reaction products with m/z 330 at 3.16 min, m/z 330 at 3.25 min, and m/z 344 at 3.43 min (FIG. 7B), corresponding to single and double O-methylation events. Identity of the m/z-330 parent ion at 3.16 min was inferred as norcodamine based on the ESI[+]-CID spectrum and unique retention time. The m/z-330 parent ion at 3.25 min produced and ESI[+]-CID spectrum corresponding to norlaudanine. The minor double O-methylation product with m/z 344 produced an ESI[+]-CID spectrum matching that of tetrahydropapaverine. GFL0MT6 efficiently converted reticuline (m/z 330) to three products with m/z 344 at 3.17 min, m/z 344 at 3.24 min, and m/z 358 at 3.43 min (FIG. 7C), indicating single and double O-methylation events. The m/z- 344 parent ions at 3.17 and 3.24 min yielded ESI[+]-CID spectra corresponding to codamine and laudanine. The double O-methylation product with a parent ion of m/z 358 generated an ESI[+]-CID spectrum matching that of laudanosine. GFL0MT6 efficiently converted scoulerine (m/z 328] to two major reaction products with m/z 342 at 3.29 min, and m/z 356 at 3.59 min [FIG. 7D), corresponding to single and double O-methylation events, respectively. The m/z- 342 parent ion produced an ESI[+]-CID spectrum corresponding to tetrahydrocolumbamine, whereas the m/z-356 parent ion yielded an ESI[+] -CID spectrum matching that of tetrahydropalmatine. Incubation of GFL0MT6 with tetrahydrocolumbine (m/z 342) generated a major product with m/z 356 and an ESI[+]-CID spectrum corresponding to tetrahydropalmatine (FIG. 7E). FLOMT7 [000153] Incubation of GFL0MT7 with scoulerine (m/z 328) yielded two minor reaction products with m/z 342 at 3.33 min and m/z 342 at 3.44 min (FIG. 7F) with ESI[+]-CID spectra corresponding to tetrahydrocolumbine (i.e. methyalted benzyl moiety of scoulerine) and tetrahydropalmatrubine (methylated isoquinoline moiety of scoulerine), respectively. The reaction product of GFL0MT7 incubated with tetrahydrocolumbine (m/z 342) generated a reaction product with m/z 356 and an ESI[+]-CID spectrum corresponding to tetrahydropalmatine (FIG. 7G). Example 8 - In vivo reaction products formed by O-methyltransferases [000154] (R,S)-Norlaudanosoline was fed to mixed cultures of E. coli harboring different combinations and permutations of pGFLOMTl, pGFL0MT2, pGFL0MT6, and pCNMT to determine the in vivo efficiency of each OMT with both N-methylated and N-desmethyl 1-benzylisoquinolines (FIG. 8). Norlaudanosoline was not recovered in ethyl acetate extractions. The empty vector control showed that E. coli was inherently incapable of transforming norlaudanosoline to other BIAs (FIG. 8A). Transformation product identifications were determined using the ESI[+]-CID spectra of authentic standards and inferences described above, which are generally not repeated below. [000155] Incubation of an E. coli strain harboring pGFLOMTl with norlaudanosoline (m/z 288) yielded one compound identified as norcodamine (m/z 330) (FIG. 8B). In contrast, incubation of an E. coli strain harboring pGFL0MT2 with norlaudanosoline generated three products with m/z 316 at 2.85 min, m/z 330 at 3.15 min, and m/z 344 at 3.42 min (FIG. 8C) corresponding to nororientaline, norcodamine, and tetrahydropapaverine, respectively. Incubation of mixed E. coli strains harboring pGFLOMTl and pGFLOMT2 with norlaudanosoline yielded compounds with m/z 330 at 3.15 min and m/z 344 at 3.42 min (FIG. 8D) corresponding to norcodamine and tetrahydropapaverine, respectively. Addition of an E. coli strain harboring pCNMT to this series altered the profile of products formed in all pGFLOMT combinations. Incubation of mixed E. coli strains harboring pGFLOMTl and pCNMT with norlaudanosoline compounds with m/z 330 at 2.99 min and m/z 344 at 3.17 min identified as reticuline and codamine (FIG. 8E). Incubation of mixed E. coli strains harboring pGFL0MT2 and pCNMT with norlaudanosoline resulted in four compounds with m/z 330 at 2.85 min, m/z 330 at 2.98 min, m/z 344 at 3.16 min, and m/z 358 at 3.4 min corresponding to orientaline, reticuline, codamine, and laudanosine (FIG. 8F). Incubation of mixed E. coli strains harboring pGFLOMTl, pGFLOMT2, and pCNMT with norlaudanosoline also produced orientaline, reticuline, codamine, and laudanosine, but with an apparently higher yield compared with incubations lacking one of the strains (FIG. 8G). [000156] Incubation of mixed E. coli strains harboring of pGFLOMTl and pGFL0MT6 with norlaudanosoline yielded two products with m/z 330 at 3.14 min and m/z 344 at 3.43 min, corresponding to norcodamine and tetrahydropapaverine, respectively (FIG. 8H). Incubation of mixed E. coli strains harboring pGFLOMT2 and pGFLOMT6 with norlaudanosoline generated three compounds with m/z 316 at 2.87 min, m/z 330 at 3.14 min, m/z 344 at 3.43 min, identified as nororientaline, norcodamine, and tetrahydropapaverine, respectively (FIG. 81}. Combining E. coli strains harboring pGFLOMTl, pGFLOMT2, and pGFL0MT6, and incubating with norlaudanosoline only changed the relative abundance of nororientaline, norcodamine, tetrahydropapaverine (FIG. 8J), compared with the absence of pGFLOMTl (FIG. 81). However, addition of an E. coli strain harboring pCNMT to this series altered the profile of products generated via all pGFLOMT combinations. Incubation of mixed E. coli strains harboring pGFLOMTl, pGFL0MT6, and pCNMT, and incubation with norlaudanosoline produced five compounds with m/z 330 at 2.99 min, m/z 330 at 3.16 min, m/z 344 at 3.18 min, m/z 344 at 3.24 min, and m/z 358 at 3.42 min, identified as reticuline, norcodamine, codamine, laudanine, and laudanosine, respectively (FIG. 8K). Mixed E. coli strains harboring pGFL0MT2, pGFLOMT6, and pCNMT with norlaudanosoline yielded compounds with m/z 330 at 2.88 min, m/z 330 at 3 min, m/z 344 at 3.16 min, m/z 344 at 3.23 min, and m/z 358 at 3.42 min, corresponding to orientaline, reticuline, codamine, laudanine, and laudanosine, respectively (FIG. 8L). Finally, incubation of mixed E. coli strains harboring pGFLOMTl, pGFL0MT2, pGFLOMT6, and pCNMT with norlaudanosoline produced the same five compounds, but with an apparently higher yield than incubations lacking the E. coli strain harboring pGFLOMTl (FIG. 8M).
