Soy protein suppresses gene expression of acetyl-coA carboxylase alpha from promoter PI in rat liver.
Dietary soy protein isolate (SPI) reduces hepatic lipogenesis by suppressing gene expression of lipogenic enzymes, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC).
In order to elucidate the mechanism of this regulation, the effect of dietary SPI on promoter (PI and PII) specific gene expression of ACC alpha was investigated.
Rats were fed experimental diets containing SPI or casein as a nitrogen source.
SPI feeding decreased the hepatic contents of total ACC mRNA as well as triglyceride (TG) content, but dietary SPI affected the amount of sterol-regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1 mRNA and protein very little.
The amount of ACC mRNA transcribed from PII promoter containing SRE was not significantly affected by dietary protein, while a significant decrease in PI-generated ACC mRNA content was observed in rats fed the SPI diet.
These data suggest that SPI feeding decreased the hepatic contents of ACC alpha mRNA mainly by regulating PI promoter via a nuclear factor(s) other than SREBP-1.
