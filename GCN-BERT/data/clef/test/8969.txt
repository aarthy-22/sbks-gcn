Anti-Inflammatory Agents as Virostatic Compounds The present invention relates to compounds of the general formula (I) and salts and physiologically functional derivatives thereof, for use in the treatment of medical conditions which are caused by an adeno virus, HHV (human herpesvirus), VZV (varicella zoster virus), HSV (herpes simplex virus), EBV (Epstein-Barr virus), vaccinia virus, or BK virus. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Viral infections are usually treated with substances targeting viral proteins, e.g. influenza is treated with M2-membrane protein inhibitors (adamantin and rimantadin) or neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir); HIV is treated with HIV protease inhbitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nucleoside and non- nucleoside analoga), fusion inhibitors (blocking the viral transmembrane protein gp41 ) or cell entry inhbitiors; HCV is treated by a combination of ribavirin and interferone alpha, where ribavirin as a nucleoside analogue inhibits the viral polymerase, and interferone alpha activates the host immune system; HBV is treated with pegylated interferone alpha and/or nucleoside or nucleotide analoga. However, treatment of these viral diseases is not satisfactory due to the high mutation rate of viruses and the thus resulting lack of efficacy of presently known medications. Moreover, severe side effects caused by interaction with host factors or by incompatibility of treatments for patients who are infected with two or several different viruses occur regularly. In view of the viruses' abilities to quickly adapt to new selection pressures caused by substances targeting viral proteins, new treatment options for viral diseases are urgently required. A new approach to circumvent the selection pressure on viruses and thus avoid the generation of resistences is the targeting of host cell factors vital for the viral replication cycle. The active metabolite of leflunomide, a DHODH inhibitor with a completely different structure has been discussed and tested lately in several viral infection models as well as in infected patients (Gabriel T. Meister, dissertation Ohio State University 2005; Chong et al. Am. J. Transplant 2006 6(1 ): 69-75), however, anti- viral activity is largely attributed to the inhibition of protein kinases which results in inhibition of phosphorylation of viral proteins. Moreover, administration of uridine in viral plaque assays did not affect the reduction of viral loads in a cytomegalovirus (CMV) model; an inhibitor exerting its activity by the inhibition of DHODH, however, according to the above cited publications would be expected to lose its inhibitory potential when the assay is supplemented with uridine. The compounds to which this invention relates have been described as DHODH inhibitors before (WO 03/006425, WO 04/056746, WO 04/056797, WO04056747, WO 08/077639, WO 09/021696 ), and the treatment of diseases caused by viral infections has been mentioned. These compounds are more active DHODH inhibitors when compared to the active metabolite of leflunomide and do not inhibit protein kinases at physiologically relevant levels. Furthermore, it has been shown that the antiviral activity of compounds from this invention can be reversed by addition of uridine (Marshall et al., Antiviral Research 100 (2013) 640- 648). Therefore, it is concluded that the antiviral activity of compounds to which this invention relates is based on inhibition of DHODH. In contrast, for the active metabolite of leflunomide antiviral activity is largely attributed to the inhibition of protein kinases. The pathogenity of viruses heavily relies on host cell machinery for replication, leading to a high need of nucleobase building blocks due to the high replication rate of the viruses. Unexpectedly it has now been found, that the inhibition of DHODH, which leads to an inhibition of the de novo biosyntheses of pyrimidines can be exploited to suppress the replication of certain viruses. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to compounds that surprisingly show virostatic activities. In particular the invention refers to the use of compounds which inhibit dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), for the treatment and prevention of viral induced diseases. Diseases or medical conditions according to the present invention are induced by adenovirus, HHV (human herpes viruses), VZV (varicella zoster viruses), HSV (herpes simplex viruses), EBV (Epstein-Barr virus), vaccinia virus, or BK virus, in particular by adenovirus.

Table 1 Examples 1. Determination of pharmacological parameters of compound 1 Pharmacological parameters of compound 1 (Table 2) were determined by standard procedures, i.e. DHODH and kinase activity assays were performed according to Davis et al., (1996. The immunosuppressive metabolite of leflunomide is a potent inhibitor of human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. Biochemistry 35, 1270-1273) and www.DiscoverX.com standard protocols, respectively; Table 2 Inhibitory activity in vitro (IC5o) DHODH (human) 1 .5 ± 0.2 nM DHODH (mouse) 3.2 ± 0.8 nM ΡΙ3Κ-α/-β/-γ/-δ >1 μΜ AKT-1/-2/-3 >15 μΜ JAK-1/-2/-3 >10 μΜ 2. Inhibition of human and murine DHODH Analysis of in vitro enzymatic activity was performed by the use of purified human DHODH in an established assay as described before (Davis et al., Biochemistry. 1996 Jan 30;35(4):1270-3; Leban et al., Bioorg Med Chem Lett. 2006 Jan 15;16(2):267-70). Putative inhibitory compounds were directly applied to the reaction in a concentration range between 100 pM and 10 μΜ. A strong and selective inhibition of human and murine DHODH could be demonstrated in vitro with IC5o values of 1 .5 ± 0.2 nM and 3.2 ± 0.8 nM, respectively (Table 2). In a comparative setting, the nucleoside analogue GCV (used as anti-cytomegaloviral reference drug) did not exert any inhibition on DHODH in vitro. No effects onto human DHODH were measured up to high concentrations of GCV (duplicate testings), i.e. DHODH exerted 100% activity even at 10 μΜ. This finding underlined the specificity of compound 1 and confirmed its strong and concentration-dependent anti-DHODH activity. Other enzymes, not related to DHODH, such as a series of protein kinases including PI3K, AKT and JAK (three to four isoforms each), were not inhibited by compound 1 (Table 2). 3. Antiviral assay in cell culture Antiviral assays were performed as described in the literature (Marschall, M. et al., 2000. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 44, 1588-1597.; Marschall M. et al., 2012. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 56, 1 135-1 137.; Kindsmuller et al., 2009. J. Virol. 83, 9045-9056.; Rechter et al., 2006. Antiviral Res. 72, 197-206). Human adenovirus type 2 (HAdV-2) showed high level of sensitivity (IC5o 0.56 ± 0.02 μΜ; Table 3) as measured in a standard plaque reduction assay. This result was confirmed and substantiated by performing a previously established virus yield assay (Kindsmuller et al., 2009. J. Virol. 83, 9045-9056)with a series of HAdVs spanning virus species A to E (one to three types each, including clinical isolates B03k and E04k). A549 cells were infected at MOI 20 and continuously treated with the given concentrations of compound 1 . Virus-containing supernatants were transferred to uninfected cells at 4 d1, 6 d2 or 2 d3 post-infection, respectively, and used for quantitation of infectious virus. Percentages of virus-positive cells per total cells were determined on the basis of indirect immunofluorescence staining (monoclonal anti-adenovirus hexon protein antibody; Abeam B025-AD51/ab7428) by microscopic countings: n = 4 for C02, C05, D19, D37; n = 3 for B03k, E04k; n = 1 for A31 , B03, D08, E04. This selection of HAdVs represented the natural variety of adenovirus- induced pathogenic infections, i.e. association with respiratory, gastrointestinal, ophthalmic or other types of symptoms. Importantly, all HAdVs were subject to inhibition at a drug concentration of 1 .1 1 μΜ, in an efficacy range between 71 % and 100% (Table 4). Highest sensitivity was seen for virus species A, C and D, lower sensitivity for B and E.
