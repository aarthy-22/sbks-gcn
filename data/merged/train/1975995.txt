Esmolol reduces autonomic hypersensitivity and length of seizures induced by electroconvulsive therapy.
We evaluated the clinical effectiveness of esmolol, an ultra-short-acting beta 1-adrenergic receptor blocking drug, to control the sinus tachycardia and increase in arterial blood pressures induced by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).
Each of 20 patients, ASA physical status I-III, participated in a double-blind, randomized study, involving four match-pair trials (placebo versus esmolol) during ECT.
Each patient acted as his or her own control (total number of ECT procedures, 160).
We administered a 4-min infusion of either placebo or esmolol at the rate of 500 micrograms.kg-1.min-1.
We then induced anesthesia with methohexital and succinylcholine.
After administration of electrical stimulation for ECT, the rate of infusion decreased to 300 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for three additional minutes and was then discontinued.
Statistically significant reductions in mean heart rate from minute 2 until minute 15 and in maximum heart rate (the mean of each patient's maximum heart rate after seizure changed from 152 +/- 23 to 115 +/- 24 beats/min) occurred in patients given esmolol.
During and immediately after infusion, arterial blood pressure also decreased.
Finally, the length of seizures decreased, as manifested clinically from 48 +/- 18 to 39 +/- 14 s and on electroencephalogram from 86 +/- 41 to 67 +/- 28 s. We conclude that esmolol effectively controls the hyperdynamic response to ECT and reduces the length of seizures.
The significance of the latter to the overall effectiveness of ECT is not known.
