Pharmacotherapy for the core symptoms in autistic disorder: current status of the research.
The current review covers extant literature on pharmacotherapy for core symptoms of autism.
The core symptoms of autism include impairments in social interaction and communication, as well as the presence of restricted and repetitive behaviors.
There are no known efficacious treatments for the core social symptoms, although effects on repetitive behaviors are indicated with some data.
While studies of fenfluramine, secretin, opiates, and mood stabilizers generally find no effect, mixed results suggest more research is needed on antidepressants and atypical antipsychotics.
Newer lines of research, including cholinergic and glutamatergic agents and oxytocin, will be of considerable interest in the future.
However, research on the treatment of core symptoms is plagued by limitations in study design, statistical power, and other issues inherent to the study of treatments for autism (e.g., heterogeneity of the disorder) that continue to prevent the elucidation of efficacious treatments.
