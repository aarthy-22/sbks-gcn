BACKGROUND 1. Technical Field The present disclosure relates to electrosurgical devices suitable for use in tissue ablation applications and, more particularly, to electrosurgical devices having a dielectric loaded coaxial aperture with distally positioned resonant structure. 2. Discussion of Related Art Treatment of certain diseases requires the destruction of malignant tissue growths, e.g., tumors. Electromagnetic radiation can be used to heat and destroy tumor cells. Treatment may involve inserting ablation probes into tissues where cancerous tumors have been identified. Once the probes are positioned, electromagnetic energy is passed through the probes into surrounding tissue. In the treatment of diseases such as cancer, certain types of tumor cells have been found to denature at elevated temperatures that are slightly lower than temperatures normally injurious to healthy cells. Known treatment methods, such as hyperthermia therapy, heat diseased cells to temperatures above 41° C while maintaining adjacent healthy cells below the temperature at which irreversible cell destruction occurs. These methods involve applying electromagnetic radiation to heat, ablate and/or coagulate tissue. Microwave energy is sometimes utilized to perform these methods. Other procedures utilizing electromagnetic radiation to heat tissue also include coagulation, cutting and/or ablation of tissue. Electrosurgical devices utilizing electromagnetic radiation have been developed for a variety of uses and applications. A number of devices are available that can be used to provide high bursts of energy for short periods of time to achieve cutting and coagulative effects on various tissues. There are a number of different types of apparatus that can be used to perform ablation procedures. Typically, microwave apparatus for use in ablation procedures include a microwave generator that functions as an energy source, and a microwave surgical instrument (e.g., microwave ablation probe) having an antenna assembly for directing the energy to the target tissue. The microwave generator and surgical instrument are typically operatively coupled by a cable assembly having a plurality of conductors for transmitting microwave energy from the generator to the instrument, and for communicating control, feedback and identification signals between the instrument and the generator. There are several types of microwave antenna assemblies in use, e.g., monopole, dipole and helical, which may be used in tissue ablation applications. In monopole and dipole antenna assemblies, microwave energy generally radiates perpendicularly away from the axis of the conductor. Monopole antenna assemblies typically include a single, elongated conductor. A typical dipole antenna assembly includes two elongated conductors, which are linearly aligned and positioned end-to-end relative to one another with an electrical insulator placed therebetween. Helical antenna assemblies include a helically-shaped conductor connected to a ground plane. Helical antenna assemblies can operate in a number of modes including normal mode (broadside), in which the field radiated by the helix is maximum in a perpendicular plane to the helix axis, and axial mode (end fire), in which maximum radiation is along the helix axis. A microwave transmission line typically includes a thin inner conductor that extends along the longitudinal axis of the transmission line and is surrounded by a dielectric material and is further surrounded by an outer conductor around the dielectric material such that the outer conductor also extends along the transmission line axis. In one variation of an antenna, a waveguiding structure, e.g., a length of transmission line or coaxial cable, is provided with a plurality of openings through which energy "leaks" or radiates away from the guiding structure. This type of construction is typically referred to as a "leaky coaxial" or "leaky wave" antenna. Some ablation targeted lesions are too small or too hard to be punctured by an ablation probe. In these cases, doctors may place the probe as close as possible to the lesion and perform an ablation. With non-directional ablation probes, the ablation may radiate to both sides of the probe which may damage healthy tissue located on the non-tumor side of the radiating section. During certain procedures, it can be difficult to assess the extent to which the microwave energy will radiate into the surrounding tissue, making it difficult to determine the area or volume of surrounding tissue that will be ablated. US 5 957 969 A discloses a catheter system comprising a tunable ablation system with a capacity tuner. A capacity tuner comprises a coaxial cable formed by an inner conductor and an outer conductor.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Hereinafter, embodiments of the presently disclosed electrosurgical device with a directional radiation pattern will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. Like reference numerals may refer to similar or identical elements throughout the description of the figures. As shown in the drawings and as used in this description, and as is traditional when referring to relative positioning on an object, the term "proximal" refers to that portion of the apparatus that is closer to the user and the term "distal" refers to that portion of the apparatus that is further from the user. Electromagnetic energy is generally classified by increasing energy or decreasing wavelength into radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma-rays. As it is used in this description, "microwave" generally refers to electromagnetic waves in the frequency range of 300 megahertz (MHz) (3 x 108 cycles/second) to 300 gigahertz (GHz) (3 x 1011 cycles/second). As it is used in this description, "ablation procedure" generally refers to any ablation procedure, such as microwave ablation, radio frequency (RF) ablation or microwave ablation assisted resection. As it is used in this description, "transmission line" generally refers to any transmission medium that can be used for the propagation of signals from one point to another. Various embodiments of the present disclosure provide electrosurgical devices for treating tissue and methods of directing electromagnetic radiation to a target volume of tissue. Embodiments may be implemented using electromagnetic radiation at microwave frequencies or at other frequencies. An electrosurgical system including an energy applicator, according to various embodiments, is designed and configured to operate between about 500 MHz and about 10 GHz with a directional radiation pattern. Various embodiments of the presently disclosed electrosurgical device with a directional radiation pattern are suitable for microwave ablation and for use to pre-coagulate tissue for microwave ablation assisted surgical resection. Although various methods described hereinbelow are targeted toward microwave ablation and the complete destruction of target tissue, it is to be understood that methods for directing electromagnetic radiation may be used with other therapies in which the target tissue is partially destroyed or damaged, such as, for example, to prevent the conduction of electrical impulses within heart tissue. In addition, although the following description describes the use of a dipole microwave antenna, the teachings of the present disclosure may also apply to a monopole, helical, or other suitable type of microwave antenna. Fig. 1 shows an electrosurgical system 10, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, which includes an energy applicator or probe 100. Probe 100 generally includes an antenna assembly 12 having a radiating portion connected by a feedline 110 (or shaft) via a transmission line 15 to a connector 16, which may further operably connect the probe 100 to a power generating source 28, e.g., a microwave or RF electrosurgical generator. Feedline 110 may electrically connect the antenna assembly 12 via the transmission line 15 to the generator 28 and may include a coaxial cable, which may be semi-rigid or flexible. Feedline 110 may have a variable length from a proximal end of the antenna assembly 12 to a distal end of transmission line 15 ranging from a length of about one inch to about ten inches. Feedline 110 may be constructed of a variety of electrically conductive materials, e.g., copper, gold, or other conductive metals with similar conductivity values. Feedline 110 may be made of stainless steel, which generally offers the strength required to puncture tissue and/or skin. Conductive materials used to form the feedline 110 may be plated with other materials, e.g., other conductive materials, to improve their properties, e.g., to improve conductivity or decrease energy loss, etc. In some embodiments, the feedline 110 includes stainless steel, and to improve its conductivity, the stainless steel may be coated with a layer of a conductive material such as copper or gold. Feedline 110 may include an inner conductor, a dielectric material coaxially surrounding the inner conductor, and an outer conductor coaxially surrounding the dielectric material. Antenna assembly 12 may be formed from a portion of the inner conductor that extends distal of the feedline 110 into the antenna assembly 12. Feedline 110 may be cooled by fluid e.g., saline or water, to improve power handling, and may include a stainless steel catheter. In some embodiments, the power generating source 28 is configured to provide microwave energy at an operational frequency from about 500 MHz to about 2500 MHz. In other embodiments, the power generating source 28 is configured to provide microwave energy at an operational frequency from about 500 MHz to about 10 GHz. Power generating source 28 may be configured to provide various frequencies of electromagnetic energy. Transmission line 15 may additionally, or alternatively, provide a conduit (not shown) configured to provide coolant from a coolant source 18 to the probe 100. Located at the distal end of the antenna assembly 12 is an end cap or tapered portion 120, which may terminate in a sharp tip 123 to allow for insertion into tissue with minimal resistance. One example of a straight probe with a sharp tip that may be suitable for use as the energy applicator 100 is commercially available under the trademark EVIDENT™ offered by Covidien. The end cap or tapered portion 120 may include other shapes, such as, for example, a tip 123 that is rounded, flat, square, hexagonal, or cylindroconical. In some variations, the antenna assembly 12 includes a distal radiating portion 105 and a proximal radiating portion 140. In some embodiments, a junction 130 couples the proximal radiating portion 140 and the distal radiating portion 105. In some embodiments, the distal and proximal radiating portions 105, 140 align at the junction 130, which is generally made of a dielectric material, e.g., adhesives, and are also supported by the inner conductor that extends at least partially through the distal radiating portion 105. Junction 130, or portions thereof, may be disposed between the proximal and distal radiating portions, 140 and 105. Junction 130 may be formed from any suitable elastomeric or ceramic dielectric material by any suitable process. In some embodiments, the junction 130 is formed by overmolding and includes a thermoplastic elastomer, such as, for example, polyether block amide (e.g., PEBAX®, manufactured by The Arkema Group of Colombes, France), polyetherimide (e.g., ULTEM® and/or EXTEM®, manufactured by SABIC Innovative Plastics of Saudi Arabia) and/or polyimide-based polymer (e.g., VESPEL®, manufactured by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company of Wilmington, Delaware, United States). Junction 130 may be formed using any suitable overmolding compound by any suitable process, and may include use of a ceramic substrate. In some embodiments, the antenna assembly 12 may be provided with a coolant chamber (not shown). Additionally, the junction 130 may include coolant inflow and outflow ports (not shown) to facilitate the flow of coolant into, and out of, the coolant chamber. Examples of coolant chamber and coolant inflow and outflow port embodiments are disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 12/401,268 filed on March 10, 2009, entitled "COOLED DIELECTRICALLY BUFFERED MICROWAVE DIPOLE ANTENNA", and U.S. Pat. No. 7,311,703 entitled "DEVICES AND METHODS FOR COOLING MICROWAVE ANTENNAS". In some embodiments, the antenna assembly 12 may be provided with an outer jacket (not shown) disposed about the distal radiating portion 105, the junction 130 and/or the proximal radiating portion 140. The outer jacket may be formed of any suitable material, such as, for example, polymeric or ceramic materials. The outer jacket may be applied by any suitable method, such as, for example, heat shrinking, overmolding, coating, spraying dipping, powder coating, baking and/or film deposition. The outer jacket may be a water cooled catheter formed of a material having low electrical conductivity. During microwave ablation, e.g., using the electrosurgical system 10, the probe 100 is inserted into or placed adjacent to tissue and microwave energy is supplied thereto. Ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) guidance may be used to accurately guide the probe 100 into the area of tissue to be treated. Probe 100 may be placed percutaneously or atop tissue, e.g., using conventional surgical techniques by surgical staff. A clinician may pre-determine the length of time that microwave energy is to be applied. Application duration may depend on many factors such as tumor size and location and whether the tumor was a secondary or primary cancer. The duration of microwave energy application using the probe 100 may depend on the progress of the heat distribution within the tissue area that is to be destroyed and/or the surrounding tissue. Single or multiple probes 100 may provide ablations in short procedure times, e.g., a few minutes, to destroy cancerous cells in the target tissue region. A plurality of probes 100 may be placed in variously arranged configurations to substantially simultaneously ablate a target tissue region, making faster procedures possible. Multiple probes 100 can be used to synergistically create a large ablation or to ablate separate sites simultaneously. Tissue ablation size and geometry is influenced by a variety of factors, such as the energy applicator design, number of energy applicators used simultaneously, time and wattage. In operation, microwave energy having a wavelength, lambda (λ), is transmitted through the antenna assembly 12, e.g., along the proximal and distal radiating portions 140, 105, and radiated into the surrounding medium, e.g., tissue. The length of the antenna for efficient radiation may be dependent on the effective wavelength, λeff, which is dependent upon the dielectric properties of the medium being radiated into. Antenna assembly 12 through which microwave energy is transmitted at a wavelength, λ, may have differing effective wavelengths, λeff, depending upon the surrounding medium, e.g., liver tissue, as opposed to, e.g., breast tissue. FIGS. 2 through 12 show a sequentially-illustrated, assembly of components forming an energy applicator or probe having a dielectric loaded coaxial aperture (e.g., "W" shown in FIG. 12) with distally positioned resonant structure (e.g., 909 shown in FIG. 9), in accordance with the present disclosure. According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, an energy applicator or probe (shown generally as 200 in FIGS. 2 and 3) is provided with a coaxial feedline 226 having an inner conductor 220 that extends along the longitudinal axis "A" of the energy applicator 200, an outer conductor 224 coaxially disposed about the inner conductor 220, and a dielectric material 222 disposed therebetween. In some embodiments, the inner conductor 220 has a diameter "D1" and the dielectric material 222 has an outer diameter "D2". At the distal end of the feedline 226, a portion of the dielectric material 222 may extend beyond the outer conductor 224. Additionally, or alternatively, a portion of the inner conductor 220 (e.g., 22 shown in FIG. 2) may extend beyond the dielectric material 222 and the outer conductor 224. In some embodiments, the antenna assembly 12, or portions thereof, may be coupled to the inner conductor portion 22. Alternatively, the antenna assembly 12, or portions thereof, may be coupled to an elongated conductor (e.g., similar to the inner conductor portion 22), wherein the elongated conductor is electrically coupled to the inner conductor 220 of the feedline 226. As shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, a proximal cylindrical dielectric sleeve 244 may be coupled to the inner conductor 220 at a distal end of the coaxial feedline 226. Additionally, or alternatively, a first dielectric segment 284 and a second dielectric segment 274 may be coupled to the inner conductor 220. Additionally, or alternatively, a distal cylindrical dielectric sleeve 264 may be coupled to the inner conductor 220. Proximal cylindrical dielectric sleeve 244, first dielectric segment 284 and a second dielectric segment 274 may be formed from dielectric materials that provide an impedance match from the coaxial feedline 226. First dielectric segment 284 may be formed from a material with a dielectric constant that is higher than the dielectric constant of the second dielectric segment 274, e.g., to maximize energy radiated into the surrounding medium, e.g., tissue. In some embodiments, a proximal cylindrical dielectric sleeve 244, having a diameter "D2", is coupled to the inner conductor 220. Proximal cylindrical dielectric sleeve 244 may be configured with a central channel 245 extending longitudinally therethrough to accommodate the inner conductor 220. Proximal cylindrical dielectric sleeve 244 may be formed from any suitable dielectric material. In some embodiments, the proximal cylindrical dielectric sleeve 244 is formed from a material with a dielectric constant in the range of about 2 to about 10. In some embodiments, a distal cylindrical dielectric sleeve 264, having a diameter "D2", is coupled to the inner conductor 220. Distal cylindrical dielectric sleeve 264 may be formed from any suitable dielectric material. Distal cylindrical dielectric sleeve 264 may be disposed distally of the proximal cylindrical dielectric sleeve 244 and may be configured with a central channel 265 extending longitudinally therethrough to accommodate the inner conductor 220. In some embodiments, the distal cylindrical dielectric sleeve 264 is formed from a material with a dielectric constant different than the dielectric constant of the proximal cylindrical dielectric sleeve 244. Distal cylindrical dielectric sleeve 264 may be a high dielectric material, e.g., a material with a dielectric constant in the range of about 3 to about 50, to shorten the effective wavelength, λeff, of energy. The length of the distal cylindrical dielectric sleeve 264 may be varied, depending on the dielectric constant of the material selected, to allow positioning of a radiating aperture (e.g., "W" shown in FIGS. 12 and 13) at a quarter wavelength (or half wavelength, etc.) from a distal short (e.g., "P" shown in FIGS. 4 and 6). For example, the physical length of the distal cylindrical dielectric sleeve 264 for a selected dielectric constant to allow positioning of an aperture at a selected wavelength from a distal short may be calculated using Equation 1. λ=cf⁢εr, where c is the speed of light, f is the frequency, and ∈r is the dielectric constant. For example, in a case where an aperture is to be positioned at a quarter wavelength, given a dielectric sleeve having a dielectric constant ∈r, using Equation 1, the length l of the dielectric sleeve is calculated as: l=λ4=c4⁢f⁢εr. In some embodiments, a first dielectric segment 284 and a second dielectric segment 274 are coupled to the inner conductor 220. As shown in FIG. 2, the first and second dielectric segments 284, 274 may be disposed between the proximal cylindrical dielectric sleeve 244 and the distal cylindrical dielectric sleeve 264. First and second dielectric segments 284, 274 generally include one or more flat planar surfaces and a partial cylindrical surface. The shape and size of the first and second dielectric segments 284, 274 may be varied from the configuration depicted in FIGS. 2 through 4 (see, e.g., 1564, 1562 and 1664, 1662 shown in FIGS. 15 and 16, respectively). In some embodiments, the first dielectric segment 284 is formed from a material with a dielectric constant in the range of about 2 to about 30. In some embodiments, the second dielectric segment 274 is formed from a material with a dielectric constant in the range of about 2 to about 30. In some embodiments, the first dielectric segment 284 has a substantially half-cylindrical shape, having a diameter "D3", and includes a flat planar surface configured with a recess in the form of a groove 287 extending longitudinally across the flat planar surface. In some embodiments, the second dielectric segment 274 has a substantially half-cylindrical shape, having a diameter "D2", and includes a flat planar surface configured with a recess in the form of a groove 277 extending longitudinally across the flat planar surface. Grooves 287 and 277 may be configured to accommodate a portion of the inner conductor 220. In some embodiments, when the first and second dielectric segments 284, 274 are coupled to the inner conductor 220, the respective flat planar surfaces of the first and second dielectric segments 284, 274 contact one another. The shape and size of the grooves 287 and 277 may be varied from the configuration depicted in FIG. 2. FIGS. 4 through 7 show an energy applicator 300, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, which is similar to the energy applicator 200 of FIG. 3, except for an elongated shaft 480 (outlined in bold lines in FIG. 4) having an opening 440 therethrough, and an end cap "P" disposed distally to the distal end of the elongated shaft 480. In some embodiments, the elongated shaft 480 has an inner diameter "D2" and an outer diameter "D3". As shown in FIG. 4, the end cap "P" may have a disc- or plate-like shape. End cap "P" may be formed of any suitable electrically-conductive material, e.g., metal such as stainless steel, titanium, etc. As shown in FIG. 6, the proximal surface "S" of the end cap "P" makes contact with both the distal end of the inner conductor 220 and the distal end of the elongated shaft 480, thereby forming a distal short. The shape and size of the end cap "P" may be varied from the configuration depicted in FIGS. 4 and 6. As shown in FIG. 7, the opening 440 in the elongated shaft 480 may be aligned with the first dielectric segment 284. In some embodiments, the first dielectric segment 284 and the elongated shaft 480 may be substantially concentric to a longitudinal axis (e.g., "A" shown in FIG. 2) of the energy applicator. Elongated shaft 480 may be electrically coupled to the outer conductor 224 of the coaxial feedline 226. Opening 440 is made by removing a radial portion the elongated shaft 480 an optimized length back from the distal short. In some embodiments, the opening 440 is positioned to maximize directivity and coupling of microwave energy into tissue, e.g., opening 440 may be placed at the voltage maximum of the standing wave created by the shorted coaxial distal end. Opening 440 may be of any length and radial angle to achieve the desired amount of coax to free space coupling and radiation directivity. The dielectric constant of dielectric materials on either side of the opening 440, proximal or distal, may vary with distance from the opening 440 to achieve impedance match and optimal energy delivery and directivity to tissue. The dielectric materials filling the coaxial structure at the site of the opening 440 may vary in dielectric constant with shells or more complex dielectric layering to achieve the optimum antenna directivity and energy to tissue delivery. In some embodiments, the first dielectric segment 284 has a diameter "D2" and the elongated shaft 480 has an outer diameter "D3", where "D3" is larger than "D2". In such cases, the opening 440 may be filled with a nonconductive radio frequency transparent material, e.g., a glass fiber epoxy composite or polyimide. This may be accomplished in an over molding process. The window may also be created by placing a heat shrink or rigid composite sleeve along the entire antenna assembly. Some examples of dielectric material configurations at the site of the opening 440, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure, are shown in FIGS. 14 through 16. FIG. 8 shows an energy applicator 400, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, which is similar to the energy applicator 300 of FIG. 7, except for a dielectric sleeve member 740 (also referred to herein as a balun insulator) disposed coaxially about a portion of the elongated shaft 480. Balun insulator 740 may be formed of any non-conductive insulator, e.g., a TEFLON® sleeve. Balun insulator 740 may extend fully or partially over the opening 440 in the elongated shaft. In some embodiments, the balun insulator 740 extends fully over the opening 440 and the half-cylindrical dielectric member 284 disposed therein. The shape, size, and arrangement of the dielectric balun insulator 740 (e.g., its position relative to the opening 440 and/or the end cap "P") may be varied from the configuration depicted in FIG. 8. Balun insulator 740 may extend beyond the open ends of one or more electrically-conductive sleeve members (e.g., 870 shown in FIG. 9) of a balun structure (e.g., 909 shown in FIG. 9) to enhance effectiveness of the balun. FIG. 9 shows an energy applicator 500, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, which is similar to the energy applicator 400 of FIG. 7, except for a first electrically-conductive sleeve member 871 and a second electrically-conductive sleeve member 872 (also referred to herein as balun outer conductors) axially aligned with a gap 940 therebetween. A proximal end portion of the first electrically-conductive sleeve member 871 may be coupled to a proximal portion of the elongated shaft 480. A distal end portion of the second electrically-conductive sleeve member 872 may be coupled to a distal portion of the elongated shaft 480, e.g., as shown in FIG. 10A. First and second electrically-conductive sleeve members 871, 872 may be formed of any suitable electrically-conductive material, e.g., metal such as stainless steel, aluminum, titanium, copper, etc. First and second electrically-conductive sleeve members 871, 872 may overlap portions of the window 440 in the elongated shaft 480. As shown in FIG. 9, the first electrically-conductive sleeve member 871 may overlap a proximal portion 401, having a length "L1", of the window 440, and the second electrically-conductive sleeve member 872 may overlap a distal portion 402, having a length "L2", of the window 440, whereby a gap 940, having a length "L3", is formed therebetween. In some embodiments, the first electrically-conductive sleeve member 871 has a length "L4", wherein "L4" may be a quarter wavelength or a half wavelength. In some embodiments, the second electrically-conductive sleeve member 872 has a length "L5", wherein "L5" may be a quarter wavelength or a half wavelength. First and second electrically-conductive sleeve members 871, 872 may have any suitable length. FIG. 11 shows an energy applicator 600, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, which is similar to the energy applicator 500 of FIG. 9, except for a tapered portion 920 extending distally from the distal end cap "P". Tapered portion 920 may terminate in a sharp tip 923 to allow for insertion into tissue with minimal resistance.

Hereinafter, a method of manufacturing an energy applicator or probe having a dielectric loaded coaxial aperture with distally positioned resonant structure, in accordance with the present disclosure, is described with reference to FIG. 18. It is to be understood that the steps of the method provided herein may be performed in combination and in a different order than presented herein without departing from the scope of the disclosure. FIG. 18 is a flowchart illustrating a method of manufacturing an electrosurgical device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. In step 1810, a coaxial feedline (e.g., 226 shown in FIG. 2) is provided. The coaxial feedline includes an inner conductor (e.g., 220 shown in FIG. 2), an outer conductor (e.g., 224 shown in FIG. 2), and a dielectric material (e.g., 222 shown in FIG. 2) disposed therebetween. In step 1820, a first dielectric member (e.g., 244 shown in FIG. 3) is joined to a portion of the inner conductor (e.g., 22 shown in FIG. 2) extending beyond the dielectric material and the outer conductor at a distal end of the coaxial feedline. The first dielectric member may have a substantially cylindrical shape, and may be configured with a central channel (e.g., 245 shown in FIG. 2) extending longitudinally therethrough to accommodate the inner conductor. In step 1830, a second dielectric member (e.g., 284 shown in FIG. 3) is joined to a portion of the inner conductor extending beyond the first dielectric member at a distal end of the first dielectric member. The second dielectric member may have a substantially half-cylindrical shape including a flat planar surface and a half cylindrical surface. The flat planar surface of the second dielectric member may be configured with a recess in the form of a groove (e.g., 287 shown in FIG. 2) extending longitudinally thereacross. In step 1840, a third dielectric member shaft (e.g., 274 shown in FIG. 3) is joined to the portion of the inner conductor extending beyond the first dielectric member at a distal end of the first dielectric member. The third dielectric member may have a substantially half-cylindrical shape including a flat planar surface and a half cylindrical surface. The flat planar surface of the third dielectric member may be configured with a recess in the form of a groove defined therein (e.g., 277 shown in FIG. 2) extending longitudinally thereacross. In step 1850, a fourth dielectric member shaft (e.g., 264 shown in FIG. 3) is joined to a portion of the inner conductor extending beyond the second and third dielectric members at a distal end of the second and third dielectric members. The fourth dielectric member may have a substantially cylindrical shape, and may be configured with a central channel defined therein (e.g., 265 shown in FIG. 2) extending longitudinally therethrough to accommodate the inner conductor. In step 1860, an elongated shaft (e.g., 480 shown in FIG. 4) having an opening defined therethrough is positioned overlying the first, second, third and fourth dielectric members, such that the opening (e.g., 440 shown in FIG. 4) is aligned with the third dielectric member. In some embodiments, the third dielectric member is configured to fill the opening in the elongated shaft (e.g., 480). In some embodiments, the opening in the elongated shaft (e.g., 480) is filled with a RF transparent material (e.g., 1485, 1585, 1685, 1783 and 1787 shown in FIGS. 14 through 17). In step 1870, a balun structure (e.g., 909 shown in FIG. 9), which includes a first balun outer conductor (e.g., 871 shown in FIG. 9) and a second balun outer conductor (e.g., 872 shown in FIG. 9) is formed onto the elongated shaft (e.g., 480 shown in FIG. 9), such that the first and second balun outer conductors (e.g., 871, 872) are each disposed at least partially overlying the opening in the elongated shaft (e.g., 480). Step 1870 may further include the steps of forming a balun insulator (e.g., 740 shown in FIG. 8) extending over an outer surface of the elongated shaft (e.g., 480 shown in FIG. 8), and positioning the first and second balun outer conductors (e.g., 871, 872) on the balun insulator (e.g., 740 shown in FIG. 9), wherein a distal end of the second balun outer conductor (e.g., 872) is positioned adjacent to a distal end of a balun short (e.g., "P" shown in FIG. 9). The above-described electrosurgical devices for treating tissue and methods of directing electromagnetic radiation to a target volume of tissue may be used to provide directional microwave ablation, wherein the heating zone may be focused to one side of the electrosurgical device, thereby allowing clinicians to target small and/or hard to access tumors without having to penetrate the tumor directly or kill more healthy tissue than necessary. The presently disclosed electrosurgical devices may allow clinicians to avoid ablating or unnecessarily heating tissue structures, such as large vessels, healthy organs or vital membrane barriers, by placing the electrosurgical device between the tumor and tissue structure and directing the electromagnetic radiation toward the tumor and away from the tissue structure. Although embodiments have been described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings for the purpose of illustration and description, it is to be understood that the inventive processes and apparatus are not to be construed as limited thereby.
