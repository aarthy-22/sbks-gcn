Curcumin attenuates allergic airway inflammation by regulation of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs)/Th17 balance in ovalbumin-sensitized mice.
The present study aimed to determine the protective effects and the underlying mechanisms of curcumin on ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic inflammation in a mouse model of allergic asthma.
Asthma mice model was established by ovalbumin.
A total of 60 mice were randomly assigned to six experimental groups: control, model, dexamethasone (2mg/kg), and curcumin (50mg/kg, 100mg/kg, 200mg/kg).
Airway resistance (Raw) was measured by the forced oscillation technique, differential cell count in BAL fluid (BALF) was measured by Wright-Giemsa staining, histological assessment was measured by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, BALF levels of Treg/Th17 cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Treg cells and Th17 cells were evaluated by flow cytometry (FCM).
Our study demonstrated that curcumin inhibited OVA-induced increases in eosinophil count; interleukin (IL)-17A level were recovered in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid increased IL-10 level in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
Histological studies demonstrated that curcumin substantially inhibited OVA-induced eosinophilia in lung tissue.
Flow cytometry (FCM) studies demonstrated that curcumin remarkably inhibited Th17 cells and significantly increased Treg cells.
The results in vivo show ovalbumin-induced significantly broke Treg/Th17 balance; curcumin treatments markedly attenuated the inflammatory in asthma model by regulating Treg/Th17 balance.
Our findings support the possible use of curcumin as a therapeutic drug for patients with allergic asthma.
