CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 60/844,351, filed on Sep. 14, 2006, which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention is directed to long-lasting therapeutic formulations comprising a genetically modified micro-organ comprising a vector comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding a therapeutic polypeptide, such as erythropoietin or interferon alpha, operably linked to one or more regulatory sequences and their methods of use. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Therapeutic agents can be delivered orally, transdermally, by inhalation, by injection or by depot with slow release. However, the method of delivery is limited by the processing that the agent is subjected to in the recipient, by the requirement for frequent administration, and limitations on the size of molecules that can be utilized. For some of the methods, the amount of therapeutic agent varies between administrations. Protein production techniques which involve the sub-cloning of a desired nucleic acid sequence/fragment into a vector which is subsequently used for modifying specific host cells, which are meant to produce the desired protein for further purification steps are limited in the amount of protein expressed, protein secretion, post-translational modifications (such as glycosylation and the accurate folding of the protein), etc. Moreover, even if a high-level of protein production could be achieved, large quantities of the recombinant protein must then be produced and purified to be free of contaminants. Development of a purification scheme is a very lengthy process. And once purified recombinant protein has been obtained, it must be further formulated to render it stable and acceptable for introduction into animals or humans. Furthermore, even formulated, purified recombinant proteins have a finite shelf life due to maintenance and storage limitations; often requiring repeated purification and formulation of more protein. The process of developing an appropriate formulation is time consuming, difficult, and costly, as well. Thus, there is a widely recognized need for long-lasting protein-based therapeutic molecules that have the requisite post-translational modifications to preserve their biological activity, which are produced inexpensively and quickly without the need for the laborious and costly methods typically associated with obtaining high-levels of recombinant proteins. Some researchers have attempted to obtain in vivo expression of recombinant gene products via gene therapy. Typically viral vectors are used to transduce cells in vivo to express recombinant gene products. These viral-based vectors have advantageous characteristics, such as the natural ability to infect the target tissue. However, retrovirus-based vectors require integration within the genome of the target tissue to allow for recombinant product expression (with the potential to activate resident oncogenes) and can only be used to transduce actively dividing tissues. Viral vectors are also often no able to sustain long-term transgene expression, which may be due at least in part to their elimination due to secondary host immune responses. Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for recombinant gene product formulations that have consistently high expression levels lasting for several weeks or more and for methods of using those formulations to treat disease. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention provides, in one embodiment, a long-lasting therapeutic formulation comprising a genetically modified micro-organ, said micro-organ comprising a vector comprising a nucleic acid sequence operably linked to one or more regulatory sequences, wherein said nucleic acid sequence encodes a therapeutic polypeptide and whereby said formulation increases expression levels of said therapeutic polypeptide by more than 5% over basal level and said increase is maintained for greater than one month. In one embodiment, the vector is a helper-dependent adenovirus vector. In one embodiment, the therapeutic polypeptide is erythropoietin, while in another embodiment, the therapeutic polypeptide is interferon alpha, which in one embodiment, is interferon alpha 2b. In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of providing a therapeutic polypeptide to a subject in need over a sustained period comprising providing one or more genetically modified micro-organs, said micro-organs comprising a vector comprising a nucleic acid sequence operably linked to one or more regulatory sequences; and implanting said genetically modified micro-organ in said subject, wherein said nucleic acid sequence encodes a therapeutic polypeptide and whereby said formulation increases expression levels of said therapeutic polypeptide by more than 5% over basal level and said increase is maintained for greater than one month. In one embodiment, the vector is a helper-dependent adenovirus vector. In one embodiment, the therapeutic polypeptide is erythropoietin, while in another embodiment, the therapeutic polypeptide is interferon alpha, which in one embodiment, is interferon alpha 2b.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION In some embodiments, the instant invention is directed to long-lasting therapeutic formulations comprising a genetically modified, tissue-based micro-organ comprising a vector comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding a therapeutic polypeptide, such as erythropoietin or interferon alpha, operably linked to one or more regulatory sequences and their methods of use. The invention provides, in one embodiment, a long-lasting therapeutic formulation comprising a genetically modified micro-organ, said micro-organ comprising a vector comprising a nucleic acid sequence operably linked to one or more regulatory sequences, wherein said nucleic acid sequence encodes a therapeutic polypeptide and whereby the expression level of the therapeutic polypeptide is increased by more than 5% over basal level and said increase is maintained for greater than one month.

In another embodiment, this invention provides a long-lasting therapeutic formulation comprising a genetically modified micro-organ, said micro-organ comprising a vector comprising a nucleic acid sequence operably linked to one or more regulatory sequences, wherein said nucleic acid sequence encodes a therapeutic polypeptide and whereby the expression level of the therapeutic polypeptide is increased by more than 5% over basal level and said increase is maintained for greater than one month and wherein said vector is a helper-dependent adenovirus vector. In another embodiment, the invention provides a long-lasting therapeutic formulation comprising a genetically modified micro-organ, said micro-organ comprising a vector comprising a nucleic acid sequence operably linked to one or more regulatory sequences, wherein said nucleic acid sequence encodes a therapeutic polypeptide and whereby the expression level of the therapeutic polypeptide is increased by more than 5% over basal level and said increase is maintained for greater than one month in an immuno-competent host. In another embodiment, the invention provides a long-lasting therapeutic formulation comprising a genetically modified micro-organ, said micro-organ comprising a vector comprising a nucleic acid sequence operably linked to one or more regulatory sequences, whereby the expression level of the therapeutic nucleic acid is increased by more than 5% over basal levels. In one embodiment, the expression level of the therapeutic nucleic acid is increased by more than 5% over basal levels in an immuno-competent host, while in another embodiment, said vector is a helper-dependent adenovirus vector. In one embodiment, the invention provides a long-lasting therapeutic formulation and methods of use thereof where the formulation comprises a genetically modified micro-organ. In one embodiment, the term “micro-organ” as used herein, refers in one embodiment, to an isolated tissue or organ structure derived from or identical to an explant that has been prepared in a manner conducive to cell viability and function. In one embodiment, a micro-organ maintains at least some in vivo structures, or in another embodiment, interactions, similar to the tissues or organ from which it is obtained. In another embodiment, micro-organs retain the micro-architecture and the three dimensional structure of the tissue or organ from which they were derived and have dimensions selected so as to allow passive diffusion of adequate nutrients and gases to cells within the micro-organ and diffusion of cellular waste out of the cells of the micro-organ so as to minimize cellular toxicity and concomitant cell death due to insufficient nutrition and/or accumulation of waste. In one embodiment, a micro-organ is a sliver of dermal tissue. In one embodiment, a micro-organ is 1-2 mm in diameter and 30-40 mm in length. In another embodiment, the diameter of a micro-organ may be, for example, 1-3 mm, 1-4 mm, 2-4 mm, 0.5-3.5 mm, or 1.5-10 mm. In another embodiment the diameter of a micro-organ may be, for example, approximately 2 mm or approximately 1.5 mm. In another embodiment, the length of the micro-organ may be 5-100 mm, 10-60 mm, 20-60 mm, 20-50 mm, 20-40 mm, 20-100 mm, 30-100 mm, 40-100 mm, 50-100 mm, 60-100 mm, 70-100 mm, 80-100 mm, or 90-100 mm. In another embodiment, the length of the micro-organ may be approximately 20 mm, approximately 30 mm, approximately 40 mm, or approximately 50 mm. In one embodiment, a micro-organ is smaller than 1.5 cm2, and in another embodiment, less than 1 cm2. In another embodiment, the diameter is less than 1.5 cm2, and in another embodiment, the length is less than 1.5 cm. In one embodiment, a micro-organ is an explant. In one embodiment, a micro-organ is tissue-derived. In another embodiment, a micro-organ is a section or portion or part of a tissue. In another embodiment, a micro-organ is a section or portion or part of an organ. A micro-organ can be distinguished from a skin graft, in one embodiment, in that it is specifically designed to survive for long periods of time in vivo and in vitro and, in another embodiment, in that its dimensions are specifically selected so as to allow passive diffusion of adequate nutrients and gases to cells within the micro-organ and diffusion of cellular waste out of the cells of the micro-organ, which in one embodiment minimizes cellular toxicity and concomitant cell death due to insufficient nutrition and/or accumulation of waste. Thus, in one embodiment, a micro-organ is not a skin graft. In another embodiment, a micro-organ can be distinguished from a collection of isolated cells, which in one embodiment, are grown on a natural or artificial scaffold, in that micro-organs maintain the micro-architecture and the three dimensional structure of the tissue or organ from which they were derived. Thus, in one embodiment, a micro-organ is not one or more cell types grown on a scaffold. A detailed description of micro-organs can be found in US-2003-0152562, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Earlier patents (WO 03/006669, WO 03/035851, WO 04/099363, which are incorporated herein by reference) described micro-organs, which can be modified to express a gene product of interest, that may be sustained outside the body in an autonomously functional state for an extended period of time, and may then be implanted subcutaneously or in other locations within the body for the purpose of treating diseases or disorders. However, the micro-organs of the present invention unexpectedly showed a much longer-term expression profile of a gene product of interest in vitro and in vivo. As used herein, the term “explant” refers, in one embodiment, to a tissue or organ or a portion thereof removed from its natural growth site in an organism and placed in a culture medium for a period of time. In one embodiment, the tissue or organ is viable, in another embodiment, metabolically active, or a combination thereof. As used herein, the term “microarchitecture” refers, in one embodiment, to a characteristic of the explant in which some or all of the cells of the tissue explant maintain, in vitro, physical and/or functional contact with at least one cell or non-cellular substance with which they were in physical and/or functional contact in vivo. In another embodiment, micro-organ explants maintain the three-dimensional structure of the tissue or organ from which they were derived. In one embodiment, micro-organ explants retain the spatial interactions, e.g. cell-cell, cell-matrix and cell-stromal interactions, and the orientation of the tissue from which they were derived. In one embodiment, preservation of spatial interactions such as described above permit the maintenance of biological functions of the explant, such as secretion of autocrine and paracrine factors and other extracellular stimuli, which in one embodiment, provide long term viability to the explant. In one embodiment, at least some of the cells of the micro-organ explant maintain, in vitro, their physical and/or functional contact with at least one cell or non-cellular substance with which they were in physical and/or functional contact in vivo. In one embodiment, some of the cells refers to at least about 50%, in another embodiment, at least about 60%, in another embodiment at least about 70%, in another embodiment, at least about 80%, and in another embodiment, at least about 90% or more of the cells of the population. In another embodiment, the cells of the explant maintain at least one biological activity of the organ or tissue from which they are isolated. In some embodiments, any of the formulation of this invention will comprise a genetically modified micro-organ, in any form or embodiment as described herein. In some embodiments, any of the formulations of this invention will consist of a genetically modified micro-organ, in any form or embodiment as described herein. In some embodiments, of the compositions of this invention will consist essentially of a genetically modified micro-organ, in any form or embodiment as described herein. In some embodiments, the term “comprise” refers to the inclusion of the indicated active agent, such as the genetically modified micro-organ, as well as inclusion of other active agents, and pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, emollients, stabilizers, etc., as are known in the pharmaceutical industry. In some embodiments, the term “consisting essentially of” refers to a composition, whose only active ingredient is the indicated active ingredient, however, other compounds may be included which are for stabilizing, preserving, etc. the formulation, but are not involved directly in the therapeutic effect of the indicated active ingredient. In some embodiments, the term “consisting essentially of” may refer to components which facilitate the release of the active ingredient. In some embodiments, the term “consisting” refers to a composition, which contains the active ingredient and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Similarly, in some embodiments, the vector of and for use in the methods of the present invention comprise a nucleic acid sequence operably linked to one or more regulatory sequences, wherein said nucleic acid sequence encodes a therapeutic polypeptide. In another embodiment, the vector consists essentially of such a nucleic acid sequence, and in another embodiment, the vector consists of such a nucleic acid sequence. Examples of mammals from which the micro-organs can be isolated include humans and other primates, swine, such as wholly or partially inbred swine (e.g., miniature swine, and transgenic swine), rodents, etc. Micro-organs may be processed from tissue from a variety of organs, which in one embodiment is the skin, the dermis, the lymph system, the pancreas, the liver, the gallbladder, the kidney, the digestive tract, the respiratory tract, the reproductive system, the urinary tract, the blood, the bladder, the cornea, the prostate, the bone marrow, the thymus, the spleen, or a combination thereof. Explants from these organs may comprise islet of Langerhan cells, hair follicles, glands, epithelial and connective tissue cells, or a combination thereof arranged in a microarchitecture similar to the microarchitecture of the organ from which the explant was obtained. In one embodiment, the microarchitecture of the organ from which the explant was obtained may be discerned or identified in the micro-organ explant using materials, apparati, and/or methods known in the art. In one embodiment, the present invention provides a formulation and methods of use thereof comprising a genetically modified micro-organ. In one embodiment, the term “genetically modified micro-organ” or “GMMO” refers to a micro-organ that expresses at least one recombinant gene product. In other embodiments, reference to a micro-organ does not necessarily refer to a non-genetically modified micro-organ, but may also refer in some instances to a genetically modified micro-organ as will be clear from the context to one of skill in the art. In one embodiment, the phrase “gene product” refers to proteins, polypeptides, peptides and functional RNA molecules. In one embodiment, the gene product encoded by the nucleic acid molecule is the desired gene product to be supplied to a subject. Examples of such gene products include proteins, peptides, glycoproteins and lipoproteins normally produced by cells of the recipient subject. In one embodiment, the gene product is not naturally occurring in the organism from which the micro-organ was harvested and/or in the organism in which the GMMO is implanted, while in another embodiment, the gene product is naturally occurring. In one embodiment, the gene product of the GMMO is similar or identical to a gene product endogenously expressed by one or more cells of the micro-organ. In one embodiment, genetic modification increases the level of a gene product that would be produced in a non-genetically modified micro-organ. In another embodiment, the gene product expressed by the GMMO is not similar or identical to a gene product endogenously expressed by one or more cells of the micro-organ. In another embodiment, the gene product encoded by the nucleic acid molecule encodes a molecule that directly or indirectly controls expression of a gene of interest. In another embodiment, the gene product encoded by the nucleic acid molecule upregulates or down-regulates the expression levels of the desired gene product to be supplied to a subject. In another embodiment, genetic modification of a micro-organ may modify the expression profile of an endogenous gene. This may be achieved, for example, by introducing an enhancer, or a repressible or inducible regulatory element for controlling the expression of an endogenous gene. Any methodology known in the art can be used for genetically altering the micro-organ explant. Any one of a number of different vectors can be used, such as viral vectors, plasmid vectors, linear DNA, etc., as known in the art, to introduce an exogenous nucleic acid fragment encoding a therapeutic agent into target cells and/or tissue. These vectors can be inserted, for example, using infection, transduction, transfection, calcium-phosphate mediated transfection, DEAE-dextran mediated transfection, electroporation, liposome-mediated transfection, biolistic gene delivery, liposomal gene delivery using fusogenic and anionic liposomes (which are an alternative to the use of cationic liposomes), direct injection, receptor-mediated uptake, magnetoporation, ultrasound, or any combination thereof, as well as other techniques known in the art (for further detail see, for example, “Methods in Enzymology” Vol. 1-317, Academic Press, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Ausubel F. M. et al. (eds.) Greene Publishing Associates, (1989) and in Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Edition, Sambrook et al. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, (1989), or other standard laboratory manuals). The polynucleotide segments encoding sequences of interest can be ligated into an expression vector system suitable for transducing mammalian cells and for directing the expression of recombinant products within the transduced cells. The introduction of the exogenous nucleic acid fragment is accomplished by introducing the vector into the vicinity of the micro-organ. Once the exogenous nucleic acid fragment has been incorporated into the cells using any of the techniques described above or known in the art, the production and/or the secretion rate of the therapeutic agent encoded by the nucleic acid fragment can be quantified. In one embodiment, the term “exogenous” refers to a substance that originated outside, for example a nucleic acid that originated outside of a cell or tissue. In one embodiment, a micro-organ of the formulation and methods of the present invention comprises a vector, which in one embodiment, facilitates recombinant gene expression. In one embodiment, the vector is a non-immunogenic gene transfer agent such as a nonviral vector (e.g. DNA plasmids or minicircle DNA), a “gutless” viral vector i.e. without endogenous genes (which in one embodiment, is due to a deletion, while in another embodiment, due to an insertion, substitution or deletion in a gene that prevents gene expression), a helper-dependent adenovirus (HDAd) vector, or adeno associated virus AAV (which in one embodiment is single stranded and in another embodiment, double stranded). In another embodiment, said formulation is so chosen such that recombinant gene expression results in lack of toxicity or immune-mediated rejection of the gene product by the micro-organ. In one embodiment, the vector is virally derived, and in another embodiment, the vector is a plasmid. In one embodiment, the virally-derived vector is derived from adenovirus, which in one embodiment, is helper-dependent adenovirus, while in another embodiment, the virally-derived vector is derived from adenovirus-associated vector, as is described hereinbelow. In one embodiment, the term “vector” or “expression vector” refers to a carrier molecule into which a nucleic acid sequence can be inserted for introduction into a cell where it can be replicated. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid molecules are transcribed into RNA, which in some cases are then translated into a protein, polypeptide, or peptide. In other cases, RNA sequences are not translated, for example, in the production of antisense molecules or ribozymes. In one embodiment, expression vectors can contain a variety of “control sequences” which refer to nucleic acid sequences necessary for the transcription and possibly translation of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host cell. In another embodiment, a vector further includes an origin of replication. In one embodiment the vector may be a shuttle vector, which in one embodiment can propagate both in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, or in another embodiment, the vector may be constructed to facilitate its integration within the genome of an organism of choice. The vector, in other embodiments may be, for example, a plasmid, a bacmid, a phagemid, a cosmid, a phage, a virus or an artificial chromosome. In one embodiment, the vector is a viral vector, which in one embodiment may be a bacteriophage, mammalian virus, or plant virus. In one embodiment, the viral vector is an adenoviral vector. In another embodiment, the adenovirus may be of any known serotype or subgroup. In one embodiment, some advantages of using an adenoviral vector as a gene transfer vector are: its mid-sized genome, ease of manipulation, high titer, wide target-cell range and high infectivity. Both ends of the adenoviral genome contain 100-200 base pair inverted repeats (ITRs), which are cis elements necessary for viral DNA replication and packaging. The early (E) and late (L) regions of the genome contain different transcription units that are divided by the onset of viral DNA replication. The E1 region (E1A and E1B) encodes proteins responsible for the regulation of transcription of the viral genome and a few cellular genes. The expression of the E2 region (E2A and E2B) results in the synthesis of the proteins for viral DNA replication. These proteins are involved in DNA replication, late gene expression and host cell shut-off. The products of the late genes, including the majority of the viral capsid proteins, are expressed only after significant processing of a single primary transcript issued by the major late promoter (MLP). The MLP, (located at 16.8 m.u.) is particularly efficient during the late phase of infection, and all the mRNAs issued from this promoter possess a 5′-tripartite leader (TPL) sequence which makes them preferred mRNAs for translation. In another embodiment, the adenoviral vector is a helper-dependent adenoviral vector, which in another embodiment, is synonymous with gutless, gutted, mini, fully deleted, high-capacity, Δ, or pseudo adenovirus, and which in another embodiment are deleted of all viral coding sequences except for sequences supporting DNA replication, which in one embodiment, comprise the adenovirus inverted terminal repeats and packaging sequence (ψ). In another embodiment, helper-dependent adenoviruses express no viral proteins. In one embodiment, a helper-dependent adenoviral vector comprises only the cis-acting elements of the adenovirus required to replicate and package the vector DNA. In one embodiment, a helper-dependent adenoviral vector comprises approximately 500 bp of wild-type adenovirus sequence. In another embodiment, the adenoviral vector additionally comprises stuffer DNA to meet the minimum requirement for a genome size of 27.7 kb, which in one embodiment is required for efficient packaging into the adenovirus capsid. In one embodiment, non-coding mammalian DNA, with minimal repeat sequences, is used as stuffer DNA. In another embodiment, stuffer DNA comprises non-mammalian DNA, which in one embodiment, is HPRT and/or C346 cosmid sequences. In one embodiment, helper-dependent adenoviruses display high-efficiency in vivo transduction, high-level transgene expression, are able to maintain long-term transgene expression, in one embodiment, by avoiding chronic toxicity due to residual expression of viral proteins, or a combination thereof. In another embodiment, helper-dependent adenoviruses have high titer production, efficient infection of a broad range of cell types, the ability to infect dividing and nondividing cells, or a combination thereof. In another embodiment, a helper-dependent adenovirus for use in the methods of the instant invention does not induce a strong adaptive immune response to an implanted micro-organ, which in one embodiment, is characterized by the generation of adeno-specific MHC class I restricted CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in immunocompetent hosts, which in one embodiment, would limit the duration of transgene expression and in another embodiment, would result in adenovirus vector clearance within several weeks. In another embodiment, a helper-dependent adenovirus for use in the methods of the instant invention does not induce high cytotoxic T cell levels (as may be measured in one embodiment by positive CD8 staining, as is known in the art), and, in another embodiment, does not induce high helper T cell levels (as may be measured in one embodiment by positive CD4 stain, as is known in the art). In another embodiment, helper-dependent adenoviruses have a lower risk of germ line transmission and insertional mutagenesis that may cause oncogenic transformation, because the vector genome does not integrate into the host cell chromosomes. In one embodiment, the cloning capacity of helper-dependent adenoviruses is very large (in one embodiment, approximately 37 kb, in another embodiment, approximately 36 kb), allowing for the delivery of whole genomic loci, multiple transgenes, and large cis-acting elements to enhance, prolong, and regulate transgene expression. In one embodiment, the helper-dependent adenovirus system for use with the compositions and in the methods of the present invention is similar to that described in Palmer and Ng, 2003 (Mol Ther 8:846) and in Palmer and Ng, 2004 (Mol Ther 10:792), which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. In one embodiment, there is a stuffer sequence inserted into the E3 region of the helper virus component of the helper-dependent adenovirus system to minimize recombination between the helper adenovirus and the helper-dependent adenovirus to produce replication competent adenovirus. In one embodiment, formulations of the instant invention comprising helper-dependent adenoviral vectors demonstrate long-term, high in vitro (FIGS. 1, 2, and 6B) and in vivo (FIG. 6A) expression levels of EPO and IFN-alpha. In another embodiment, formulations of the instant invention comprising helper-dependent adenoviral vectors demonstrate an increased percent of peak EPO expression levels for at least 100 days post-transduction compared to micro-organs comprising adenovirus-5 (FIG. 3). Without being bound by theory, one factor that may contribute to the long-lasting, high levels of gene product from micro-organs of the instant invention is use of a helper-dependent adenovirus vector, which is non-toxic to tissue and non-immunogenic within the formulations of the present invention. In another embodiment, the adenoviral vector is E1-deleted, while in another embodiment, the adenoviral vector additionally comprises deletions for E2, E3, E4, or a combination thereof. In another embodiment, the viral vector is an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV). In one embodiment, AAV is a parvovirus, discovered as a contamination of adenoviral stocks. It is a ubiquitous virus (antibodies are present in 85% of the US human population) that has not been linked to any disease. It is also classified as a dependovirus, because its replication is dependent on the presence of a helper virus, such as adenovirus. At least nine serotypes have been isolated, of which AAV-2 is the best characterized. AAV has a single-stranded linear DNA that is encapsidated into capsid proteins VP1, VP2 and VP3 to form an icosahedral virion of 20 to 24 nm in diameter. In one embodiment, the AAV DNA is approximately 4.7 kilobases long. In one embodiment, it contains two open reading frames and is flanked by two ITRs. There are two major genes in the AAV genome: rep and cap. The rep gene codes for proteins responsible for viral replications, whereas cap codes for capsid protein VP1-3. Each ITR forms a T-shaped hairpin structure. These terminal repeats are the only essential cis components of the AAV for chromosomal integration. Therefore, in one embodiment, the AAV can be used as a vector with all viral coding sequences removed and replaced by the cassette of genes for delivery. In one embodiment, when using recombinant AAV (rAAV) as an expression vector, the vector comprises the 145-bp ITRs, which are only 6% of the AAV genome, which in one embodiment, leaves space in the vector to assemble a 4.5-kb DNA insertion. In one embodiment, AAV is safe in that it is not considered pathogenic nor is it associated with any disease. The removal of viral coding sequences minimizes immune reactions to viral gene expression, and therefore, rAAV evokes only a minimal inflammatory response, if any. In another embodiment, AAV vector is double-stranded, while in another embodiment, AAV vector is self-complementary, which in one embodiment, bypasses the requirement of viral second-strand DNA synthesis, which in one embodiment, results in early transgene expression. In another embodiment, the viral vector is a retroviral vector. The retroviruses are a group of single-stranded RNA viruses characterized by an ability to convert their RNA to double-stranded DNA in infected cells by a process of reverse-transcription. The resulting DNA then stably integrates into cellular chromosomes as a provirus and directs synthesis of viral proteins. The integration results in the retention of the viral gene sequences in the recipient cell and its descendants. The retroviral genome contains three genes, gag, pol, and env that code for capsid proteins, polymerase enzyme, and envelope components, respectively. A sequence found upstream from the gag gene contains a signal for packaging of the genome into virions. Two long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences are present at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the viral genome. These contain strong promoter and enhancer sequences and are also required for integration in the host cell genome. In order to construct a retroviral vector in one embodiment, a nucleic acid encoding one or more oligonucleotide or polynucleotide sequences of interest is inserted into the viral genome in the place of certain viral sequences to produce a virus that is replication-defective. In order to produce virions, a packaging cell line containing the gag, pol, and env genes but without the LTR and packaging components is constructed. When a recombinant plasmid containing a cDNA, together with the retroviral LTR and packaging sequences is introduced into this cell line (by calcium phosphate precipitation, for example), the packaging sequence allows the RNA transcript of the recombinant plasmid to be packaged into viral particles, which are then secreted into the culture media. The media containing the recombinant retroviruses is then collected, optionally concentrated, and used for gene transfer. Retroviral vectors are able to infect a broad variety of cell types. However, integration and stable expression require the division of host cells. In other embodiments, the viral vector is derived from a virus such as vaccinia virus, lentivirus, polio virus, hepatitis virus, papilloma virus, cytomegalovirus, simian virus, or herpes simplex virus. In certain embodiments of the invention, the vector comprising a nucleic acid sequence may comprise naked recombinant DNA or plasmids. Transfer of the construct may be performed by any method which physically or chemically permeabilizes the cell membrane. In one embodiment, the vector is a mini-circle DNA, which in one embodiment, is a supercoiled DNA molecule for non-viral gene transfer, which has neither a bacterial origin of replication nor an antibiotic resistance marker. In another embodiment, mini-circle DNA comprises no bacterial control regions from gene delivery vectors during the process of plasmid production. They are thus smaller and potentially safer than other plasmids used in gene therapy. In one embodiment, mini-circle DNA produce high yield, are simple to purify, and provide robust and persistent transgene expression. Construction of vectors using standard recombinant techniques is well known in the art (see, for example, Maniatis, et al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual (Cold Spring Harbor, 1990) and Ausubel, et al., 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (John Wiley & Sons, 1996), both incorporated herein by reference). In another embodiment, a vector further comprises an insertion of a heterologous nucleic acid sequence encoding a marker polypeptide. The marker polypeptide may comprise, for example, yECitrine, green fluorescent protein (GFP), DS-Red (red fluorescent protein), secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP), β-galactosidase, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase, luciferase, GFP/EGFP, human growth hormone, or any number of other reporter proteins known to one skilled in the art. In another embodiment, the vectors may comprise one or more genes of interest. Thus, in one embodiment, a vector of the instant invention may comprise a gene of interest, which in one embodiment, is erythropoietin or interferon alpha2b, which in one embodiment, expresses a marker, and in another embodiment, is linked in frame to a marker, which in one embodiment allows identification of the gene product of interest and in another embodiment, allows the distinction between a gene product of interest produced by a micro-organ and a similar gene product produced endogenously by host cells outside of the micro-organ(s). In one embodiment, a vector comprising a nucleic acid encoding a therapeutic polypeptide of the instant invention is introduced into a micro-organ. There are a number of techniques known in the art for introducing cassettes and/or vectors into cells, for affecting the methods of the present invention, such as, but not limited to: direct DNA uptake techniques, and virus, plasmid, linear DNA or liposome mediated transduction, receptor-mediated uptake and magnetoporation methods employing calcium-phosphate mediated and DEAE-dextran mediated methods of introduction, electroporation or liposome-mediated transfection, (for further detail see, for example, “Methods in Enzymology” Vol. 1-317, Academic Press, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Ausubel F. M. et al. (eds.) Greene Publishing Associates, (1989) and in Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Edition, Sambrook et al. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, (1989), or other standard laboratory manuals). In one embodiment, bombardment with nucleic acid coated particles may be a method for transferring a naked DNA expression construct into cells. This method depends on the ability to accelerate DNA-coated micro-projectiles to a high velocity allowing them to pierce cell membranes and enter cells without killing them. Several devices for accelerating small particles have been developed. One such device relies on a high voltage discharge to generate an electrical current, which in turn provides the motive force. The micro-projectiles used have comprised biologically inert or biocompatible substances such as tungsten or gold beads. It is to be understood that any of these methods may be utilized for introduction of the desired sequences into cells, and cells thereby produced are to be considered as part of this invention, as is their use for effecting the methods of this invention. In one embodiment, the vectors of the formulations and methods of the instant invention comprise a nucleic acid sequence. As used herein, the term “nucleic acid” refers to polynucleotide or to oligonucleotides such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and, where appropriate, ribonucleic acid (RNA) or mimetic thereof. The term should also be understood to include, as equivalents, analogs of RNA or DNA made from nucleotide analogs, and, as applicable to the embodiment being described, single (sense or antisense) and double-stranded polynucleotide. This term includes oligonucleotides composed of naturally occurring nucleobases, sugars and covalent internucleoside (backbone) linkages as well as oligonucleotides having non-naturally-occurring portions which function similarly. Such modified or substituted oligonucleotides are often preferred over native forms because of desirable properties such as, for example, enhanced cellular uptake, enhanced affinity for nucleic acid target and increased stability in the presence of nucleases. In one embodiment, the term “nucleic acid” or “oligonucleotide” refers to a molecule, which may include, but is not limited to, prokaryotic sequences, eukaryotic mRNA, cDNA from eukaryotic mRNA, genomic DNA sequences from eukaryotic (e.g., mammalian) DNA, and even synthetic DNA sequences. The term also refers to sequences that include any of the known base analogs of DNA and RNA. The nucleic acids can be produced by any synthetic or recombinant process, which are well known in the art. Nucleic acids can further be modified to alter biophysical or biological properties by means of techniques known in the art. For example, the nucleic acid can be modified to increase its stability against nucleases (e.g., “end-capping”), or to modify its solubility, or binding affinity to complementary sequences. These nucleic acids may comprise the vector, the expression cassette, the promoter sequence, the gene of interest, or any combination thereof. In another embodiment, its lipophilicity may be modified, which, in turn, will reflect changes in the systems employed for its delivery, and in one embodiment, may further be influenced by whether such sequences are desired for retention within, or permeation through the skin, or any of its layers. Such considerations may influence any compound used in this invention, in the methods and systems described. In one embodiment, DNA can be synthesized chemically from the four nucleotides in whole or in part by methods known in the art. Such methods include those described in Caruthers (1985; Science 230:281-285). DNA can also be synthesized by preparing overlapping double-stranded oligonucleotides, filling in the gaps, and ligating the ends together (see, generally, Sambrook et al. (1989; Molecular Cloning—A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Edition. Cold Spring Habour Laboratory Press, New York)). In another embodiment, inactivating mutations may be prepared from wild-type DNA by site-directed mutagenesis (see, for example, Zoller et al. (1982; DNA. 1984 December; 3(6):479-88); Zoller (1983); and Zoller (1984; DNA. 1984 December; 3(6):479-88); McPherson (1991; Directed Mutagenesis: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, NY)). The DNA obtained can be amplified by methods known in the art. One suitable method is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method described in Saiki et al. (1988; Science. 1988 Jan. 29; 239(4839):487-491), Mullis et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,195, and Sambrook et al. (1989). Methods for modifying nucleic acids to achieve specific purposes are disclosed in the art, for example, in Sambrook et al. (1989). Moreover, the nucleic acid sequences of the invention can include one or more portions of nucleotide sequence that are non-coding for the protein of interest. Variations in DNA sequences, which are caused by point mutations or by induced modifications (including insertion, deletion, and substitution) to enhance the activity, half-life or production of the polypeptides encoded thereby, are also encompassed in the invention. The formulations of this invention may comprise nucleic acids, in one embodiment, or in another embodiment, the methods of this invention may include delivery of the same, wherein, in another embodiment, the nucleic acid is a part of a vector. The efficacy of a particular expression vector system and method of introducing nucleic acid into a cell can be assessed by standard approaches routinely used in the art as described hereinbelow. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, a fragment or derivative of a nucleic acid sequence or gene that encodes for a protein or peptide can still function in the same manner as the entire wild type gene or sequence. Likewise, forms of nucleic acid sequences can have variations as compared to wild type sequences, nevertheless encoding the protein or peptide of interest, or fragments thereof, retaining wild type function exhibiting the same biological effect, despite these variations. Each of these represents a separate embodiment of this present invention. In one embodiment, the formulations and methods of the present invention may be used for gene silencing applications. In one embodiment, the activity or function of a particular gene is suppressed or diminished, via the use of anti-sense oligonucleotides, which are chimeric molecules, containing two or more chemically distinct regions, each made up of at least one nucleotide. In one embodiment, chimeric oligonucleotides comprise at least one region wherein the oligonucleotide is modified so as to confer upon the oligonucleotide an increased resistance to nuclease degradation, increased cellular uptake, and/or increased binding affinity for the target polynucleotide. An additional region of the oligonucleotide may serve as a substrate for enzymes capable of cleaving RNA:DNA or RNA:RNA hybrids, which according to this aspect of the invention, serves as a means of gene silencing via degradation of specific sequences. Cleavage of the RNA target can be routinely detected by gel electrophoresis and, if necessary, associated nucleic acid hybridization techniques known in the art. The chimeric antisense oligonucleotides may, in one embodiment, be formed as composite structures of two or more oligonucleotides and/or modified oligonucleotides, as is described in the art (see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,013,830; 5,149,797; 5,220,007; 5,256,775; 5,366,878; 5,403,711; 5,491,133; 5,565,350; 5,623,065; 5,652,355; 5,652,356; and 5,700,922), and may, in another embodiment, comprise a ribozyme sequence. Inhibition of gene expression, activity or function is effected, in another embodiment, via the use of small interfering RNAs, which provides sequence-specific inhibition of gene expression. Administration of double stranded/duplex RNA (dsRNA) corresponding to a single gene in an organism can silence expression of the specific gene by rapid degradation of the mRNA in affected cells. This process is referred to as gene silencing, with the dsRNA functioning as a specific RNA inhibitor (RNAi). RNAi may be derived from natural sources, such as in endogenous virus and transposon activity, or it can be artificially introduced into cells (Elbashir S M, et al (2001). Nature 411:494-498) via microinjection (Fire et al. (1998) Nature 391: 806-11), or by transformation with gene constructs generating complementary RNAs or fold-back RNA, or by other vectors (Waterhouse, P. M., et al. (1998). Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95, 13959-13964 and Wang, Z., et al. (2000). J. Biol. Chem. 275, 40174-40179). The RNAi mediating mRNA degradation, in one embodiment, comprises duplex or double-stranded RNA, or, in other embodiments, include single-stranded RNA, isolated RNA (partially purified RNA, essentially pure RNA, synthetic RNA, recombinantly produced RNA), as well as altered RNA that differs from naturally occurring RNA by the addition, deletion and/or alteration of one or more nucleotides. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid of the formulations and methods of the instant invention encode a therapeutic polypeptide. In one embodiment, the term “polypeptide” refers to a molecule comprised of amino acid residues joined by peptide (i.e., amide) bonds and includes peptides, polypeptides, and proteins. Hence, in one embodiment, the polypeptides of this invention may have single or multiple chains of covalently linked amino acids and may further contain intrachain or interchain linkages comprised of disulfide bonds. In one embodiment, some polypeptides may also form a subunit of a multiunit macromolecular complex. In one embodiment, the polypeptides can be expected to possess conformational preferences and to exhibit a three-dimensional structure. Both the conformational preferences and the three-dimensional structure will usually be defined by the polypeptide's primary (i.e., amino acid) sequence and/or the presence (or absence) of disulfide bonds or other covalent or non-covalent intrachain or interchain interactions. In one embodiment, the term “peptide” refers to native peptides (either degradation products, synthetically synthesized peptides or recombinant peptides) and/or peptidomimetics (typically, synthetically synthesized peptides), such as peptoids and semipeptoids which are peptide analogs, which may have, for example, modifications rendering the peptides more stable while in a body or more capable of penetrating into cells. Such modifications include, but are not limited to N terminus modification, C terminus modification, peptide bond modification, including, but not limited to, CH2—NH, CH2—S, CH2—S═O, O═C—NH, CH2—O, CH2—CH2, S═C—NH, CH═CH or CF═CH, backbone modifications, and residue modification. Methods for preparing peptidomimetic compounds are well known in the art and are specified, for example, in Quantitative Drug Design, C. A. Ramsden Gd., Chapter 17.2, F. Choplin Pergamon Press (1992), which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. Peptide bonds (—CO—NH—) within the peptide may be substituted, for example, by N-methylated bonds (—N(CH3)—CO—), ester bonds (—C(R)H—C—O—O—C(R)—N—), ketomethylen bonds (—CO—CH2—), aza bonds (—NH—N(R)—CO—), wherein R is any alkyl, e.g., methyl, carba bonds (—CH2—NH—), hydroxyethylene bonds (—CH(OH)—CH2—), thioamide bonds (—CS—NH—), olefinic double bonds (—CH═CH—), retro amide bonds (—NH—CO—), peptide derivatives (—N(R)—CH2—CO—), wherein R is the “normal” side chain, naturally presented on the carbon atom. These modifications can occur at any of the bonds along the peptide chain and even at several (2-3) at the same time. Natural aromatic amino acids, Trp, Tyr and Phe, may be substituted for synthetic non-natural acid such as TIC, naphthylelanine (Nol), ring-methylated derivatives of Phe, halogenated derivatives of Phe or o-methyl-Tyr. In addition to the above, the peptides of the present invention may also include one or more modified amino acids or one or more non-amino acid monomers (e.g. fatty acids, complex carbohydrates etc). In one embodiment, the term “amino acid” or “amino acids” is understood to include the naturally occurring amino acids; those amino acids often modified post-translationally in vivo, including, for example, hydroxyproline, phosphoserine and phosphothreonine; and other unusual amino acids including, but not limited to, 2-aminoadipic acid, hydroxylysine, isodesmosine, nor-valine, nor-leucine and ornithine. Furthermore, the term “amino acid” may include both D- and L-amino acids. As used herein, the term “amino acid” refers to either the D or L stereoisomer form of the amino acid, unless otherwise specifically designated. Also encompassed within the scope of this invention are equivalent proteins or equivalent peptides, e.g., having the biological activity of purified wild type tumor suppressor protein. “Equivalent proteins” and “equivalent polypeptides” refer to compounds that depart from the linear sequence of the naturally occurring proteins or polypeptides, but which have amino acid substitutions that do not change it's biologically activity. These equivalents can differ from the native sequences by the replacement of one or more amino acids with related amino acids, for example, similarly charged amino acids, or the substitution or modification of side chains or functional groups. The peptides or polypeptides, or the DNA sequences encoding same, may be obtained from a variety of natural or unnatural sources, such as a prokaryotic or a eukaryotic cell. In one embodiment, the source cell may be wild type, recombinant, or mutant. In another embodiment, the plurality of peptides or polypeptides may be endogenous to microorganisms, such as bacteria, yeast, or fungi, to a virus, to an animal (including mammals, invertebrates, reptiles, birds, and insects) or to a plant cell. In another embodiment, the peptides or polypeptides may be obtained from more specific sources, such as the surface coat of a virion particle, a particular cell lysate, a tissue extract, or they may be restricted to those polypeptides that are expressed on the surface of a cell membrane. In another embodiment, the peptide or polypeptide is derived from a particular cell or tissue type, developmental stage or disease condition or stage. In one embodiment, the disease condition or stage is cancer, in another embodiment, the disease condition is an infection, which in another embodiment, is an HIV infection. In another embodiment, the disease condition is a developmental disorder, while in another embodiment, the disease condition is a metabolic disorder. The polypeptide of the present invention can be of any size. As can be expected, the polypeptides can exhibit a wide variety of molecular weights, some exceeding 150 to 200 kilodaltons (kD). Typically, the polypeptides may have a molecular weight ranging from about 5,000 to about 100,000 daltons. Still others may fall in a narrower range, for example, about 10,000 to about 75,000 daltons, or about 20,000 to about 50,000 daltons. In an alternative embodiment, the polypeptides of the present invention may be 1-250 amino acid residues long. In another embodiment, the polypeptides of the present invention may be 10-200 amino acid residues long. In an alternative embodiment, the polypeptides of the present invention may be 50-100 amino acid residues long. In an alternative embodiment, the polypeptides of the present invention may be 1-250 amino acid residues long. In an alternative embodiment, the polypeptides of the present invention may be 1-250 amino acid residues long.

In another embodiment, the peptides or polypeptides are hormones. In another embodiment, the peptides or polypeptides are regulatory proteins. Regulatory proteins command the numerous interactions that govern the expression and replication of genes, the performance of enzymes, the interplay between cells and their environment, and many other manifestations. In another embodiment, the peptides or polypeptides are cytoskeletal proteins. Cytoskeletal proteins form a flexible framework for the cell, provide attachment points for organelles and formed bodies, and make communication between parts of the cell possible. In another embodiment, the peptides or polypeptides are toxins. In another embodiment, the therapeutic nucleic acids of the present invention encode one or more suicide genes. In another embodiment, the peptides or polypeptides are functional fragments of agonists, antagonists, antigens, enzymes, enzyme activators, enzyme inhibitors, enzyme substrates, hormones, regulatory proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, or toxins. “Functional fragments” are meant to indicate a portion of the peptide or polypeptide which is capable of performing one or more of the functions of the peptide or polypeptide, even in the absence of the remainder of the peptide or polypeptide. In one embodiment, the functional fragment is sufficient to mediate an intermolecular interaction with a target of interest. In an alternative embodiment, the peptide binds DNA or RNA or a fragment thereof. In one embodiment, the DNA or RNA binding peptide may be any of the many known in the art including, but not limited to: Zinc finger proteins such as Beta-beta-alpha zinc finger proteins, Nuclear receptor proteins, Loop-sheet-helix type protein, and GAL4 type protein; the Helix-turn-helix proteins such as Cro and repressor proteins, LacI purine repressor proteins (PurR), FokI restriction endonuclease (DNA-recognition region), Gamma-delta recombinase protein (C-terminal domain), Hin recombinase protein, Trp repressor protein, Diptheria tox repressor, Catabolite gene activator proteins (CAP), Homeodomain proteins, RAP1 protein, Prd paired protein, Tc3 transposase protein, TFIIB family, Interferon regulatory factor, Transcription factor family, and ETS domain family bacteriophage; and the Leucine zipper proteins such as Basic zipper proteins and Zipper-type proteins (helix-loop-helix).

In another embodiment, the peptide or polypeptide is a receptor or a fragment thereof. In one embodiment, the peptide or polypeptide may represent a cognate peptide of any of the peptides or polypeptides described hereinabove. A “cognate” peptide is any peptide that interacts and/or binds to another molecule. According to other embodiments of the present invention, recombinant gene products may be encoded by a polynucleotide having a modified nucleotide sequence, as compared to a corresponding natural polynucleotide. In addition to proteins, recombinant gene products may also comprise functional RNA molecules. According to another embodiment of the present invention, the formulations and methods of the present invention may provide a micro-organ producing functional RNA molecules. Functional RNA molecules may comprise antisense oligonucleotide sequences, ribozymes comprising the antisense oligonucleotide described herein and a ribozyme sequence fused thereto. Such a ribozyme is readily synthesizable using solid phase oligonucleotide synthesis. Ribozymes are being increasingly used for the sequence-specific inhibition of gene expression by the cleavage of mRNAs encoding proteins of interest [Welch et al., “Expression of ribozymes in gene transfer systems to modulate target RNA levels.” Curr Opin Biotechnol. 1998 October; 9(5):486-96]. The possibility of designing ribozymes to cleave any specific target RNA has rendered them valuable tools in both basic research and therapeutic applications. In the therapeutics area, ribozymes have been exploited to target viral RNAs in infectious diseases, dominant oncogenes in cancers and specific somatic mutations in genetic disorders [Welch et al., “Ribozyme gene therapy for hepatitis C virus infection.” Clin Diagn Virol. Jul. 15, 1998; 10(2-3):163-71. Most notably, several ribozyme gene therapy protocols for HIV patients are already in Phase I trials. More recently, ribozymes have been used for transgenic animal research, gene target validation and pathway elucidation. Several ribozymes are in various stages of clinical trials. ANGIOZYME was the first chemically synthesized ribozyme to be studied in human clinical trials. ANGIOZYME specifically inhibits formation of the VEGF-r (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor receptor), a key component in the angiogenesis pathway. Ribozyme Pharmaceuticals, Inc., as well as other firms has demonstrated the importance of anti-angiogenesis therapeutics in animal models. HEPTAZYME, a ribozyme designed to selectively destroy Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) RNA, was found effective in decreasing Hepatitis C viral RNA in cell culture assays. As described hereinabove, in one embodiment, the formulations and methods of the present invention provide a therapeutic formulation comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding a therapeutic polypeptide. In one embodiment, the term “therapeutic” refers to a molecule, which when provided to a subject in need, provides a beneficial effect. In some cases, the molecule is therapeutic in that it functions to replace an absence or diminished presence of such a molecule in a subject. In one embodiment, the therapeutic protein is that of a protein which is absent in a subject, such as in cases of subjects with an endogenous null or mis-sense mutation of a required protein. In other embodiments, the endogenous protein is mutated, and produces a non-functional protein, compensated for by the provision of the functional protein. In other embodiments, expression of a heterologous protein is additive to low endogenous levels, resulting in cumulative enhanced expression of a given protein. In other embodiments, the molecule stimulates a signaling cascade that provides for expression, or secretion, or others of a critical element for cellular or host functioning. In one embodiment, the term “therapeutic formulation” describes a substance applicable for use in the diagnosis, or in another embodiment, cure, or in another embodiment, mitigation, or in another embodiment, treatment, or in another embodiment, prevention of a disease, disorder, condition or infection. In one embodiment, the “therapeutic formulation” of this invention refers to any substance which affect the structure or function of the target to which it is applied. In another embodiment, the “therapeutic formulation” of the present invention is a molecule that alleviates a symptom of a disease or disorder when administered to a subject afflicted thereof.

In one embodiment, the therapeutic polypeptide is erythropoietin, while in another embodiment, the therapeutic polypeptide is interferon alpha, which in one embodiment, is interferon alpha 2b. In one embodiment, said therapeutic polypeptide is any other therapeutic polypeptide. In one embodiment, “treatment” refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures, wherein the object is to prevent or lessen the targeted pathologic condition or disorder as described hereinabove. Thus, in one embodiment, treating may include directly affecting or curing, suppressing, inhibiting, preventing, reducing the severity of, delaying the onset of, reducing symptoms associated with the disease, disorder or condition, or a combination thereof. Thus, in one embodiment, “treating” refers inter alia to delaying progression, expediting remission, inducing remission, augmenting remission, speeding recovery, increasing efficacy of or decreasing resistance to alternative therapeutics, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, “preventing” refers, inter alia, to delaying the onset of symptoms, preventing relapse to a disease, decreasing the number or frequency of relapse episodes, increasing latency between symptomatic episodes, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, “suppressing” or “inhibiting”, refers inter alia to reducing the severity of symptoms, reducing the severity of an acute episode, reducing the number of symptoms, reducing the incidence of disease-related symptoms, reducing the latency of symptoms, ameliorating symptoms, reducing secondary symptoms, reducing secondary infections, prolonging patient survival, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, symptoms are primary, while in another embodiment, symptoms are secondary. In one embodiment, “primary” refers to a symptom that is a direct result of a particular disease, while in one embodiment; “secondary” refers to a symptom that is derived from or consequent to a primary cause. In one embodiment, the compounds for use in the present invention treat primary or secondary symptoms or secondary complications related to said disease. In another embodiment, “symptoms” may be any manifestation of a disease or pathological condition. In one embodiment, a therapeutic nucleic acid may encode a therapeutic polypeptide, which may in one embodiment, comprise an enzyme, an enzyme cofactor, a cytotoxic protein, an antibody, a channel protein, a transporter protein, a growth factor, a hormone, a cytokine, a receptor, a mucin, a surfactant, an aptamer or a hormone. In another embodiment, the therapeutic polypeptide may be of one or more of the categories as described above. In another embodiment, a therapeutic nucleic acid may encode functional RNA as described hereinbelow. In one embodiment, the term “antibody or antibody fragment” refers to intact antibody molecules as well as functional fragments thereof, such as Fab, F(ab′)2, and Fv that are capable of binding to an epitope. In one embodiment, an Fab fragment refers to the fragment which contains a monovalent antigen-binding fragment of an antibody molecule, which can be produced by digestion of whole antibody with the enzyme papain to yield an intact light chain and a portion of one heavy chain. In one embodiment, Fab′ fragment refers to a part of an antibody molecule that can be obtained by treating whole antibody with pepsin, followed by reduction, to yield an intact light chain and a portion of the heavy chain. Two Fab′ fragments may be obtained per antibody molecule. In one embodiment, (Fab′)2 refers to a fragment of an antibody that can be obtained by treating whole antibody with the enzyme pepsin without subsequent reduction. In another embodiment, F(ab′)2 is a dimer of two Fab′ fragments held together by two disulfide bonds. In one embodiment, Fv, may refer to a genetically engineered fragment containing the variable region of the light chain and the variable region of the heavy chain expressed as two chains. In one embodiment, the antibody fragment may be a single chain antibody (“SCA”), a genetically engineered molecule containing the variable region of the light chain and the variable region of the heavy chain, linked by a suitable polypeptide linker as a genetically fused single chain molecule. Methods of making these fragments are known in the art. (See for example, Harlow and Lane, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York, 1988, incorporated herein by reference). In one embodiment, the antibody will recognize an epitope, which in another embodiment, refers to antigenic determinant on an antigen to which the paratope of an antibody binds. Epitopic determinants may, in other embodiments, consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or carbohydrate side chains and in other embodiments, may have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, and/or in other embodiments, have specific charge characteristics. In one embodiment, the epitope recognized is from a pathogen, or in another embodiment, a pathogenic cell, or in another embodiment, a protein aberrantly expressed, which, in another embodiment, may refer to the location, quantity, or combination thereof of expression. Another form of an antibody fragment is a peptide coding for a single complementarity-determining region (CDR). CDR peptides (“minimal recognition units”) can be obtained by constructing genes encoding the CDR of an antibody of interest. Such genes are prepared, for example, by using the polymerase chain reaction to synthesize the variable region from RNA of antibody-producing cells. See, for example, Larrick and Fry, Methods, 2: 106-10, 1991. In one embodiment, the antibody is tumoricidal, and is thereby therapeutic in certain cancers. Antibodies that possess tumoricidal activity are also known in the art, the use of any of which may represent an embodiment of this invention, including IMC-C225, EMD 72000, OvaRex Mab B43.13, anti-ganglioside G(D2) antibody ch14.18, CO17-1A, trastuzumab, rhuMAb VEGF, sc-321, AF349, BAF349, AF743, BAF743, MAB743, AB1875, Anti-Flt-4AB3127, FLT41-A, rituximab, 2C3, CAMPATH 1H, 2G7, Alpha IR-3, ABX-EGF, MDX-447, anti-p75 IL-2R, anti-p64 IL-2R, and 2A11. In one embodiment, the “therapeutic nucleic acid” of this invention may encode or the “therapeutic polypeptide” may be molecules that serve as antihypertensives, antidepressants, antianxiety agents, anticlotting agents, anticonvulsants, blood glucose-lowering agents, decongestants, antihistamines, antitussives, anti-inflammatories, antipsychotic agents, cognitive enhancers, cholesterol-reducing agents, antiobesity agents, autoimmune disorder agents, anti-impotence agents, antibacterial and antifungal agents, hypnotic agents, anti-Parkinsonism agents, antibiotics, antiviral agents, anti-neoplastics, barbituates, sedatives, nutritional agents, beta blockers, emetics, anti-emetics, diuretics, anticoagulants, cardiotonics, androgens, corticoids, anabolic agents, growth hormone secretagogues, anti-infective agents, coronary vasodilators, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, antiprotozoals, gastrointestinal agents, serotonin antagonists, anesthetics, hypoglycemic agents, dopaminergic agents, anti-Alzheimer's Disease agents, anti-ulcer agents, platelet inhibitors and glycogen phosphorylase inhibitors. In one embodiment, the “therapeutic formulation” of this invention is antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal or antiparasitic. In another embodiment, the therapeutic formulation has cytotoxic or anti-cancer activity. In another embodiment, the therapeutic formulation is immunostimulatory. In another embodiment, the therapeutic formulation inhibits inflammatory or immune responses. In one embodiment, the therapeutic nucleic acids may encode or the therapeutic polypeptides may be cytokines, such as interferons or interleukins, or their receptors. Lack of expression of cytokines, or of the appropriate ones, has been implicated in susceptibility to diseases, and enhanced expression may lead to resistance to a number of infections. Expression patterns of cytokines may be altered to produce a beneficial effect, such as for example, a biasing of the immune response toward a Th1 type expression pattern, or a Th2 pattern in infection, or in autoimmune disease, wherein altered expression patterns may prove beneficial to the host. In another embodiment, the therapeutic nucleic acid may encode or the therapeutic polypeptide may be an enzyme, such as one involved in glycogen storage or breakdown. In another embodiment, the therapeutic protein comprises a transporter, such as an ion transporter, for example CFTR, or a glucose transporter, or other transporters whose deficiency, or inappropriate expression, results in a variety of diseases.

In one embodiment, the formulations and methods of this invention are for prevention of, or therapeutic intervention of viral infection, or in another embodiment, bacterial, parasitic, or fungal infection, or a combination thereof. According to this aspect of the invention, the formulations and methods of this invention are for prevention of, or therapeutic intervention in disease. In one embodiment, the disease for which the subject is thus treated may comprise, but is not limited to: muscular dystrophy, cancer, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, infection, renal disease, neurodegenerative disease, such as alzheimer's disease, parkinson's disease, huntington's chorea, Creuztfeld-Jacob disease, autoimmune disease, such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, endocarditis, Graves' disease or ALD, respiratory disease such as asthma or cystic fibrosis, bone disease, such as osteoporosis, joint disease, liver disease, disease of the skin, such as psoriasis or eczema, ophthalmic disease, otolaryngeal disease, other neurological disease such as Turret syndrome, schizophrenia, depression, autism, or stoke, or metabolic disease such as a glycogen storage disease or diabetes. It is to be understood that any disease whereby expression of a particular protein, provision of a therapeutic protein, provision of a drug, inhibition of expression of a particular protein, etc., which can be accomplished via the formulations of this invention and according to the methods of this invention, is to be considered as part of this invention. In one embodiment, the formulations and methods of the instant invention comprise a nucleic acid sequence operably linked to one or more regulatory sequences. In one embodiment, a nucleic acid molecule introduced into a cell of a micro-organ is in a form suitable for expression in the cell of the gene product encoded by the nucleic acid. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule includes coding and regulatory sequences required for transcription of a gene (or portion thereof). When the gene product is a protein or peptide, the nucleic acid molecule includes coding and regulatory sequences required for translation of the nucleic acid molecule include promoters, enhancers, polyadenylation signals, sequences necessary for transport of an encoded protein or peptide, for example N-terminal signal sequences for transport of proteins or peptides to the surface of the cell or secretion, in one embodiment. Nucleotide sequences which regulate expression of a gene product (e.g., promoter and enhancer sequences) are selected based upon the type of cell in which the gene product is to be expressed and the desired level of expression of the gene product. For example, a promoter known to confer cell-type specific expression of a gene linked to the promoter can be used. A promoter specific for myoblast gene expression can be linked to a gene of interest to confer muscle-specific expression of that gene product. Muscle-specific regulatory elements which are known in the art include upstream regions from the dystrophin gene (Klamut et al., (1989) Mol. Cell. Biol. 9:2396), the creatine kinase gene (Buskin and Hauschka, (1989) Mol. Cell. Biol. 9:2627) and the troponin gene (Mar and Ordahl, (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 85:6404). Negative response elements in keratin genes mediate transcriptional repression (Jho Sh et al, (2001). J. Biol Chem). Regulatory elements specific for other cell types are known in the art (e.g., the albumin enhancer for liver-specific expression; insulin regulatory elements for pancreatic islet cell-specific expression; various neural cell-specific regulatory elements, including neural dystrophin, neural enolase and A4 amyloid promoters). Alternatively, a regulatory element which can direct constitutive expression of a gene in a variety of different cell types, such as a viral regulatory element, can be used. Examples of viral promoters commonly used to drive gene expression include those derived from polyoma virus, Adenovirus 2, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Simian Virus 40, and retroviral LTRs. Alternatively, a regulatory element which provides inducible expression of a gene linked thereto can be used. The use of an inducible regulatory element (e.g., an inducible promoter) allows for modulation of the production of the gene product in the cell. Examples of potentially useful inducible regulatory systems for use in eukaryotic cells include hormone-regulated elements (e.g., see Mader, S, and White, J. H. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5603-5607), synthetic ligand-regulated elements (see, e.g., Spencer, D. M. et al 1993) Science 262:1019-1024) and ionizing radiation-regulated elements (e.g., see Manome, Y. Et al. (1993) Biochemistry 32:10607-10613; Datta, R. et al. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA89:1014-10153). Additional tissue-specific or inducible regulatory systems which may be developed can also be used in accordance with the invention. In one embodiment, a regulatory sequence of the instant invention may comprise a CMV promoter, while in another embodiment; the regulatory sequence may comprise a CAG promoter. In one embodiment, a CAG promoter is a composite promoter that combines the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early enhancer and a modified chicken beta-actin promoter and first intron. In one embodiment, a regulatory sequence may comprise a simian virus (SV)-40 polyadenylation sequence, which in one embodiment, is the mechanism by which most messenger RNA molecules are terminated at their 3′ ends in eukaryotes. In one embodiment, the polyadenosine (poly-A) tail protects the mRNA molecule from exonucleases and is important for transcription termination, for export of the mRNA from the nucleus, and for translation. In another embodiment, a formulation of the present invention may comprise one or more regulatory sequences. In one embodiment, formulations of the instant invention comprising CMV or CAG promoters in conjunction with SV40 demonstrate long-term, high in vitro (FIGS. 1, 5, and 7B) and in vivo (FIG. 6A) expression levels of EPO and IFN-alpha. Without being bound by theory, one factor that may contribute to the long-lasting, high levels of gene product from micro-organs of the instant invention is the use of CMV, or alternatively, CAG as a promoter, which may be especially effective in micro-organ explants in promoting constitutive gene expression. In one embodiment, the term “promoter” refers to a DNA sequence, which, in one embodiment, is directly upstream of the coding sequence and is important for basal and/or regulated transcription of a gene. In one embodiment, a promoter of the present invention is operatively linked to a gene of interest. In another embodiment, the promoter is a mutant of the endogenous promoter, which is normally associated with expression of the gene of interest, under the appropriate conditions. In one embodiment, a promoter of the compositions and for use in the methods of the present invention is a regulatable promoter. In another embodiment, a regulatable promoter refers to a promoter whereby expression of a gene downstream occurs as a function of the occurrence or provision of specific conditions which stimulate expression from the particular promoter. In some embodiments, such conditions result in directly turning on expression, or in other embodiments, remove impediments to expression. In some embodiments, such conditions result in turning off, or reducing expression. In one embodiment, such conditions may comprise specific temperatures, nutrients, absence of nutrients, presence of metals, or other stimuli or environmental factors as will be known to one skilled in the art. In one embodiment, a regulatable promoter may be regulated by galactose (e.g. UDP-galactose epimerase (GAL10), galactokinase (GAL1)), glucose (e.g. alcohol dehydrogenase II (ADH2)), or phosphate (e.g. acid phosphatase (PHO5)). In another embodiment, a regulatable promoter may be activated by heat shock (heat shock promoter) or chemicals such as IPTG or Tetracycline, or others, as will be known to one skilled in the art. It is to be understood that any regulatable promoter, and conditions for such regulation is encompassed by the vectors, nucleic acids and methods of this invention, and represents an embodiment thereof.

In one embodiment, the nucleic acid sequence encoding a therapeutic polypeptide or nucleic acid is optimized for increased levels of therapeutic polypeptide or nucleic acid expression, or, in another embodiment, for increased duration of therapeutic polypeptide or nucleic acid expression, or, in another embodiment, a combination thereof. In one embodiment, the term “optimized” refers to a desired change, which, in one embodiment, is a change in gene expression and, in another embodiment, in protein expression.

In another embodiment, the increased duration of gene expression is compared to gene expression in non-vector-expressing controls, or alternatively, compared to gene expression in wild-type-vector-expressing controls. Expression in mammalian cells is hampered, in one embodiment, by transcriptional silencing, low mRNA half-life, alternative splicing events, premature polyadenylation, inefficient nuclear translocation and availability of rare tRNAs pools. The source of many problems in mammalian expressions are found within the message encoding the transgene including in the autologous expression of many crucial mammalian genes as well. The optimization of mammalian RNAs may include modification of cis acting elements, adaptation of its GC-content, modifying codon bias with respect to non-limiting tRNAs pools of the mammalian cell, avoiding internal homologous regions and excluding RNAi's. Therefore, in one embodiment, when relying on carefully designed synthetic genes, stable messages with prolonged half-lives, constitutive nuclear export and high level protein production within the mammalian host can be expected.

Recombinant erythropoietin produced by genetic engineering techniques involving the expression of a protein product in vitro from a host cell transformed with the gene encoding erythropoietin has been used to treat anemia resulting from chronic renal failure. Currently, EPO is used in the treatment of anemia of renal failure, the anemia associated with HIV infection in zidovudine (AZT) treated patients, and anemia associated with cancer chemotherapy. Administration of rhu-EPO has become routine in the treatment of anemia secondary to renal insufficiency, where doses of 50-75 u/kg given three times per week are used to gradually restore hematocrit and eliminate transfusion dependency. Many cell surface and secretory proteins produced by eukaryotic cells are modified with one or more oligosaccharide groups called glycosylation, which can dramatically affect protein stability, secretion, and subcellular localization as well as biological activity. In one embodiment, both human urinary derived erythropoietin and recombinant erythropoietin (expressed in mammalian cells) having the amino acid sequence 1-165 of human erythropoietin comprise three N-linked and one O-linked oligosaccharide chains which together comprise about 40% of the total molecular weight of the glycoprotein.

In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of providing a therapeutic formulation to a subject in need in which the therapeutic polypeptide is interferon, or in which the therapeutic nucleic acid encodes, interferon, which in one embodiment, is interferon alpha, which in one embodiment, is interferon alpha 2a. In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of providing a therapeutic polypeptide which is interferon, which in one embodiment, is interferon alpha, which in one embodiment, is interferon alpha 2a to a subject in need. In one embodiment, interferons are multi-functional cytokines that are capable of producing pleitrophic effects on cells, such as anti-viral, anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory effects. Because of these cellular responses to interferons, interferon-alpha and interferon-beta have been found to be clinically useful in the treatment of viral, proliferative and inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and several forms of cancer. Interferon therapies may also have potential use for the treatment of other inflammatory diseases, viral diseases and proliferative diseases. Thus, a subject in need of interferons may have one or all of the above-mentioned diseases or conditions. There are three major classes of interferons: alpha (α), beta (β), and gamma (γ). Aside from their antiviral and anti-oncogenic properties, interferons activate macrophage and natural killer lymphocyte, and enhance major histocompatibility complex glycoprotein classes I and II. Interferon-αis secreted by leukocytes (B-cells and T-cells). Interferon-β is secreted by fibroblasts, and interferon-γ is secreted by T-cells and natural killer lymphocytes.

In one embodiment, IFN-alpha-2b has a specific activity of about 2.6×108 (260 million) International Units/mg as measured by HPLC assay. In one embodiment, IFN-alpha-2b is one of the Type I interferons, which belong to the larger helical cytokine superfamily, which includes growth hormones, interleukins, several colony-stimulating factors and several other regulatory molecules. All function as regulators of cellular activity by interacting with cell-surface receptor complexes, known as IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, and activating various signaling pathways. Interferons produce antiviral and anti-proliferative responses in cells.

In another embodiment, the invention provides a nucleic acid sequence with greater than 85% homology to SEQ ID No: 2, a vector comprising such a nucleic acid sequence, and a cell comprising such as vector. The term “homology”, as used herein, when in reference to any nucleic acid sequence indicates a percentage of nucleotides in a candidate sequence that is identical with the nucleotides of a corresponding native nucleic acid sequence. In one embodiment, the terms “homology”, “homologue” or “homologous”, in any instance, indicate that the sequence referred to, exhibits, in one embodiment at least 70% correspondence with the indicated sequence. In another embodiment, the nucleic acid sequence exhibits at least 72% correspondence with the indicated sequence.

Similarly, reference to a correspondence to a particular sequence includes both direct correspondence, as well as homology to that sequence as herein defined. Homology may be determined by computer algorithm for sequence alignment, by methods well described in the art. For example, computer algorithm analysis of nucleic acid sequence homology may include the utilization of any number of software packages available, such as, for example, the BLAST, DOMAIN, BEAUTY (BLAST Enhanced Alignment Utility), GENPEPT and TREMBL packages. An additional means of determining homology is via determination of nucleic acid sequence hybridization, methods of which are well described in the art (See, for example, “Nucleic Acid Hybridization” Hames, B. D., and Higgins S. J., Eds. (1985); Sambrook et al., 1989, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, (Volumes 1-3) Cold Spring Harbor Press, N.Y.; and Ausubel et al., 1989, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Green Publishing Associates and Wiley Interscience, N.Y). In one embodiment, methods of hybridization may be carried out under moderate to stringent conditions. Hybridization conditions being, for example, overnight incubation at 42° C. in a solution comprising: 10-20% formamide, 5×SSC (150 mM NaCl, 15 mM trisodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), 5×Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, and 20 μg/ml denatured, sheared salmon sperm DNA. In one embodiment, the present invention provides therapeutic formulations comprising micro-organs and methods of use thereof. In one embodiment, the preparation of therapeutic micro-organs comprises (a) obtaining a plurality of micro-organ explants from a donor subject, each of the plurality of micro-organ explants comprises a population of cells, each of the plurality of micro-organ explants maintaining a microarchitecture of an organ from which it is derived and at the same time having dimensions selected so as to allow diffusion of adequate nutrients and gases to cells in the micro-organ explants and diffusion of cellular waste out of the micro-organ explants so as to minimize cellular toxicity and concomitant death due to insufficient nutrition and accumulation of the waste in the micro-organ explants; (b) genetically modifying the plurality of micro-organ explants, so as to obtain a plurality of genetically modified micro-organ explants, said micro-organs comprising and secreting the proteins differing by the at least one amino acid; and (c) implanting the plurality of genetically modified micro-organ explants within a plurality of recipient subjects. In one embodiment, the preparation of therapeutic micro-organs is performed as described in PCT patent applications WO 03/006669, WO 03/035851 and WO 04/099363, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Methods for the preparation and processing of micro-organs into genetically modified micro-organs are disclosed in WO2004/099363, incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Micro-organs comprise tissue dimensions defined such that diffusion of nutrients and gases into every cell in the three dimensional micro-organ, and sufficient diffusion of cellular wastes out of the explant, is assured. Ex vivo maintenance of the micro-organs, which in one embodiment, is in minimal media, can continue for an extended period of time, whereupon controlled ex vivo transduction incorporating desired gene candidates within cells of the micro-organs using viral or non-viral vectors occurs, thus creating genetically modified micro-organs. In one embodiment, micro-organs are harvested using a drill and coring needle, as described hereinbelow. In another embodiment, micro-organs are harvested using a harvesting system that utilizes a vacuum to hold the skin taut and open the slits during insertion of the coring drill. In another embodiment, any tool which may be used to harvest dermal tissue may be used to harvest micro-organs of the appropriate size, including but not limited to those tools and methods described in PCT Application WO 04/099363. Incorporation of recombinant nucleic acid within the micro-organs to generate genetically modified micro-organs or biopumps can be accomplished through a number of methods well known in the art. Nucleic acid constructs can be utilized to stably or transiently transduce the micro-organ cells. In stable transduction, the nucleic acid molecule is integrated into the micro-organ cells genome and as such it represents a stable and inherited trait. In transient transduction, the nucleic acid molecule is maintained in the transduced cells as an episome and is expressed by the cells but it is not integrated into the genome. Such an episome can lead to transient expression when the transduced cells are rapidly dividing cells due to loss of the episome or to long term expression wherein the transduced cells are non-dividing cells. Typically the nucleic acid sequence is subcloned within a particular vector, depending upon the preferred method of introduction of the sequence to within the micro-organs, as described hereinabove. Once the desired nucleic acid segment is subcloned into a particular vector it thereby becomes a recombinant vector. In one embodiment, micro-organs are incubated at 32° C. before and after genetic modification, while in another embodiment, they are incubated at 37° C. In another embodiment, micro-organs are incubated at 33° C., 34° C., 35° C., 36° C., 38° C., 39° C., 40° C., 28° C., 30° C., 31° C., 25° C., 42° C., or 45° C. In one embodiment, micro-organs are incubated at 10% CO2 before and after genetic modification, while in another embodiment, they are incubated at 5% CO2. In another embodiment, micro-organs are incubated at 12% CO2, 15% CO2, 17% CO2, or 20% CO2. In another embodiment, micro-organs are incubated at 2% CO2, 6% CO2, 7% CO2, 8% CO2, or 9% CO2. In another embodiment, incubation temperatures, CO2 concentrations, or a combination thereof may be kept at a single temperature or concentration before, during, and after genetic modification, while in another embodiment, incubation temperatures, CO2 concentrations, or a combination thereof may be adjusted at different points before, during, and after genetic modification of micro-organs. In another embodiment, micro-organs are incubated at 85-100% humidity, which in one embodiment is 95% humidity, in another embodiment, 90% humidity, and in another embodiment, 98% humidity. In one embodiment, the levels of therapeutic nucleic acids or polypeptides may be detected using any method known in the art. The efficacy of a particular expression vector system and method of introducing nucleic acid into a cell can be assessed by standard approaches routinely used in the art. For example, DNA introduced into a cell can be detected by a filter hybridization technique (e.g., Southern blotting) and RNA produced by transcription of introduced DNA can be detected, for example, by Northern blotting, RNase protection or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The gene product can be detected by an appropriate assay, for example by immunological detection of a produced protein, such as with a specific antibody, or by a functional assay to detect a functional activity of the gene product, such as an enzymatic assay. In one embodiment, ELISA, Western blots, or radioimmunoassay may be used to detect proteins. If the gene product of interest to be expressed by a cell is not readily assayable, an expression system can first be optimized using a reporter gene linked to the regulatory elements and vector to be used. The reporter gene encodes a gene product which is easily detectable and, thus, can be used to evaluate efficacy of the system. Standard reporter genes used in the art include genes encoding β-galactosidase, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase, luciferase and human growth hormone. Thus, in one embodiment, therapeutic polypeptide or nucleic acid expression levels are measured in vitro, while in another embodiment, therapeutic polypeptide or nucleic acid expression levels are measured in vivo. In one embodiment, in vitro determination of polypeptide or nucleic acid expression levels, which in one embodiment, is EPO levels and in another embodiment, IFN-alpha levels, allows a determination of the number of micro organs to be implanted in a patient via determining the secretion level of a therapeutic agent by a micro-organ in vitro; estimating a relationship between in vitro production and secretions levels and in vivo serum levels of the therapeutic agent; and determining an amount of the therapeutic formulation to be implanted, based on the determined secretion level and the estimated relationship. In another preferred embodiment of this invention, polynucleotide(s) can also include trans-, or cis-acting enhancer or suppresser elements which regulate either the transcription or translation of endogenous genes expressed within the cells of the micro-organs, or additional recombinant genes introduced into the micro-organs. Numerous examples of suitable translational or transcriptional regulatory elements, which can be utilized in mammalian cells, are known in the art. For example, transcriptional regulatory elements comprise cis- or trans-acting elements, which are necessary for activation of transcription, from specific promoters [(Carey et al., (1989), J. Mol. Biol. 209:423-432; Cress et al., (1991), Science 251:87-90; and Sadowski et al., (1988), Nature 335:5631-564)]. Translational activators are exemplified by the cauliflower mosaic virus translational activator (TAV) [see for example, Futterer and Hohn, (1991), EMBO J. 10:3887-3896]. In this system a bi-cistronic mRNA is produced. That is, two coding regions are transcribed in the same mRNA from the same promoter. In the absence of TAV, only the first cistron is translated by the ribosomes, however, in cells expressing TAV, both cistrons are translated. The polynucleotide sequence of cis-acting regulatory elements can be introduced into cells of micro-organs via commonly practiced gene knock-in techniques. For a review of gene knock-in/out methodology see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,487,992, 5,464,764, 5,387,742, 5,360,735, 5,347,075, 5,298,422, 5,288,846, 5,221,778, 5,175,385, 5,175,384, 5,175,383, 4,736,866 as well as Burke and Olson, Methods in Enzymology, 194:251-270, 1991; Capecchi, Science 244:1288-1292, 1989; Davies et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 20 (11) 2693-2698, 1992; Dickinson et al., Human Molecular Genetics, 2(8):1299-1302, 1993; Duff and Lincoln, “Insertion of a pathogenic mutation into a yeast artificial chromosome containing the human APP gene and expression in ES cells”, Research Advances in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders, 1995; Huxley et al., Genomics, 9:742-750 1991; Jakobovits et al., Nature, 362:255-261 1993; Lamb et al., Nature Genetics, 5: 22-29, 1993; Pearson and Choi, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1993, 90:10578-82; Rothstein, Methods in Enzymology, 194:281-301, 1991; Schedl et al., Nature, 362: 258-261, 1993; Strauss et al., Science, 259:1904-1907, 1993, WO 94/23049, WO 93/14200, WO 94/06908 and WO 94/28123 also provide information. Down-regulation of endogenous sequences may also be desired, in order to assess production of the recombinant product exclusively. Toward this end, antisense RNA may be employed as a means of endogenous sequence inactivation. Exogenous polynucleotide(s) encoding sequences complementary to the endogenous mRNA sequences are transcribed within the cells of the micro-organ. Down regulation can also be effected via gene knock-out techniques, practices well known in the art (“Molecular Cloning: A laboratory Manual” Sambrook et al., (1989); “Current Protocols in Molecular Biology” Volumes I-III Ausubel, R. M., ed. (1994); Ausubel et al., “Current Protocols in Molecular Biology”, John Wiley and Sons, Baltimore, Md. (1989); Perbal, “A Practical Guide to Molecular Cloning”, John Wiley & Sons, New York (1988)). Over expression of the recombinant product may be desired as well. Overexpression may be accomplished by providing a high copy number of one or more coding sequences in the respective vectors. These exogenous polynucleotide sequences can be placed under transcriptional control of a suitable promoter of a mammalian expression vectors to regulate their expression. In another embodiment, multiple copies of the same gene or of several related genes may be used as a means to increase polypeptide or nucleic acid expression. In one embodiment, expression is stabilized by DNA elements, which in one embodiment are matrix-associating regions (MARs) or scaffold-associating regions (SARs). In one embodiment, an adenoviral vector is the vector of the compositions and for use in the methods of the present invention. In an embodiment in which an adenoviral vector is used as a vector, the helper-dependent adenovirus system may be used in one embodiment, to prepare therapeutic polypeptide or nucleic acid-expressing helper-dependent adenovirus vector for transforming micro-organs. In one embodiment, such a helper-dependent adenovirus system comprises a helper-dependent adenovirus, a helper virus, and a producer cell line is used in the preparation of the formulation of the present invention is as described in Palmer and Ng, 2003 Mol Ther 8:846 and in Palmer and Ng, 2004 Mol Ther 10:792, which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. In one embodiment, a helper cell line, designated 293, which was transformed from human embryonic kidney cells by Ad5 DNA fragments and constitutively expresses E1 proteins is used to generate and propagate replication deficient adenoviral vectors. In another embodiment, helper cell lines may be derived from human muscle cells, hematopoietic cells or other human embryonic mesenchymal or epithelial cells. Alternatively, the helper cells may be derived from the cells of other mammalian species that are permissive for human adenovirus. Such cells include, e.g., Vero cells or other monkey embryonic mesenchymal or epithelial cells. In one embodiment, micro-organs are maintained ex vivo for a period of time, which may range from several hours to several months. In one embodiment, they are maintained for several days, and in another embodiment, for several weeks prior to implantation. Without being limited by theory, in one embodiment, said incubation allows cells to process and break down viral proteins, which in one embodiment are viral capsids, present as a result of viral vector transduction. In one embodiment, such a turnover of capsid proteins occurs within 2-3 days, so that, in one embodiment, little if any viral capsid proteins remain by the 10th day ex vivo. In one embodiment, the breaking down of viral capsids further reduces the immunogenicity of the formulations of the instant invention and increases the expression levels and expression duration of the gene or genes of interest. In another embodiment, said incubation allows the early HD-Ad vector-induced innate immune responses to occur in vitro, which in one embodiment, will not persist beyond 24 hours in the absence of Adeno gene transcription. In another embodiment, the later adaptive responses that normally follow the administration of transcription-competent first-generation-Ad vectors, which are predominantly characterized in one embodiment, by lymphocyte infiltration and in another embodiment by induction of Ad-specific CTL's, are not be elicited by HD-Ad vectors. In one embodiment, the ex vivo micro-organ is exposed to viral vector at a dosage of 1.6-3×109 infectious particles (ip)/ml, 3-4×1012 viral particles/ml, or 2×1011 viral particles/ml. In another embodiment, ex vivo micro-organs are exposed to viral vector at a dosage of 1×03 to 1×1012 viral particles/ml, in another embodiment from 1×103 to 1×109, and in another embodiment, from 1×106 to 1×109 and in another embodiment, 1×106 to 1×1012 viral particles/ml. In one embodiment, the dosage of viral particles/g body weight of subject that are administered to a subject within a micro-organ is less than 1×103, and in another embodiment, less than 1×1012, and in another embodiment, less than 1×101 viral particles/g body weight of subject. In one embodiment, growth factors are used to increase the number of cells in the micro-organs. In one embodiment, in vitro expression can be assessed prior to implantation, enabling the possibility for in vitro to in vivo correlation studies of expressed recombinant proteins. In some embodiments of the invention, the amounts of tissue sample including a genetically modified cell(s) to be implanted are determined from one or more of: corresponding amounts of the therapeutic agent of interest routinely administered to such subjects based on regulatory guidelines, specific clinical protocols or population statistics for similar subjects, corresponding amounts of the therapeutic agent such as protein of interest specifically to that same subject in the case that he/she has received it via injections or other routes previously, subject data such as weight, age, physical condition, clinical status, pharmacokinetic data from previous tissue sample which includes a genetically modified cell administration to other similar subjects, response to previous tissue sample which includes a genetically modified cell administration to that subject, or a combination thereof. Thus, in one embodiment, the level of expression of gene products by one or more micro-organs is determined in vitro, a relationship between in vitro and in vivo therapeutic polypeptide or nucleic acid expression levels is determined or estimated, and the number of micro-organs to be implanted in a particular patient is determined based on the calculated or estimated relationship. The dosage of the therapeutic agent may be adjusted as described previously (WO2004/099363). In one embodiment, a micro-organ or a genetically modified micro-organ may be maintained in vitro for a proscribed period of time until they are needed for implantation into a host. In one embodiment, a micro-organ or a genetically modified micro-organ may be maintained or stored in culture for between 1-7 days, between 1-8 weeks, or for 1-4 months. In another embodiment, the therapeutic agent, left in the supernatant medium surrounding the tissue sample, can be isolated and injected or applied to the same or a different subject. Alternatively or additionally, a genetically modified micro-organ can be cryogenically preserved by methods known in the art, for example, without limitation, gradual freezing (0° C., −20° C., −80° C., −196° C.) in DMEM containing 10% DMSO, immediately after being formed from the tissue sample or after genetic alteration. In one embodiment, the formulation of the instant invention may be implanted in an organ or system that is affected by a disease or disorder to be treated or prevented by a method or route which results in localization of the micro-organ at a desired site. In another embodiment, the location of the implanted formulation may be distal from an organ or system that is affected by a disease or disorder. Thus, while in one embodiment, the recombinant protein is released locally, in another embodiment, the recombinant protein diffuses to the lymphatic system, which in one embodiment, may ultimately lead to systemic distribution of the recombinant protein. Thus, the present invention provides for the use of therapeutic formulations in various concentrations to treat a disease or disorder manifesting in any part of the subject in need. According to this aspect and in one embodiment, formulations of the instant invention may be implanted intratumorally. In another embodiment, formulations may be implanted at a site distal from the tumor, which in one embodiment is associated with metastasis of a particular type of tumor. In another embodiment, formulations of the instant invention may be implanted into the kidney of a subject, which in one embodiment is a subcapsular implantation. In another embodiment, formulations of the instant invention are implanted laparascopically. In one embodiment, the formulations of the invention may be implanted a single time for acute treatment of temporary conditions, or may be implanted more than one time, especially in the case of progressive, recurrent, or degenerative disease. In one embodiment, one or more formulations of the invention may be administered simultaneously, or in another embodiment, they may be administered in a staggered fashion. In one embodiment, the staggered fashion may be dictated by the stage or phase of the disease. In one embodiment, the micro-organ is implanted at a desired location in the subject in such a way that at least a portion of the cells of the micro-organ remain viable. In one embodiment of this invention, at least about 5%, in another embodiment of this invention, at least about 10%, in another embodiment of this invention, at least about 20%, in another embodiment of this invention, at least about 30%, in another embodiment of this invention, at least about 40%, and in another embodiment of this invention, at least about 50% or more of the cells remain viable after administration to a subject. The period of viability of the cells after administration to a subject can be as short as a few hours, e.g., twenty-four hours, to a few days, to as long as a few weeks to months or years. Micro-organ implantation within a recipient subject provides for a sustained dosage of the recombinant product. The micro-organs may be prepared, prior to implantation, for efficient incorporation within the host facilitating, for example, formation of blood vessels within the implanted tissue. Recombinant products may therefore be delivered immediately to peripheral recipient circulation, following production. Alternatively, micro-organs may be prepared, prior to implantation, to prevent cell adherence and efficient incorporation within the host. Examples of methods that prevent blood vessel formation include encasement of the micro-organs within commercially available cell-impermeant diameter restricted biological mesh bags made of silk or nylon, or others such as, for example GORE-TEX bags (Terrill P J, Kedwards S M, and Lawrence J C. (1991) The use of GORE-TEX bags for hand burns. Burns 17(2): 161-5), or other porous membranes that are coated with a material that prevents cellular adhesion, for example Teflon. Gene products produced by micro-organs can then be delivered via, for example, polymeric devices designed for the controlled delivery compounds, e.g., drugs, including proteinaceous biopharmaceuticals. A variety of biocompatible polymers (including hydrogels), including both biodegradable and non-degradable polymers, can be used to form an implant for the sustained release of a gene product of the micro-organs in context of the invention at a particular target site. The generation of such implants is generally known in the art (see, for example, Concise Encyclopedia of Medical & Dental Materials, ed.

No. 4,391,909; and Sefton U.S. Pat. No. 4,353,888). Implantation of genetically modified micro-organs according to the present invention can be effected via standard surgical techniques or via injecting micro-organ preparations into the intended tissue regions of the mammal utilizing specially adapted syringes employing a needle of a gauge suitable for the administration of micro-organs. In another embodiment, a catheter is employed for implanted micro-organs. In one embodiment, any of the implantation methods described in PCT Publication WO2 04/099363 may be used and is considered an embodiment of this invention. In one embodiment, micro-organs are implanted subcutaneously, intradermally, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally or intragastrically. In one embodiment, the term implanted excludes being grafted as a split-thickness or full-thickness skin graft. In one embodiment of the present invention, the donor micro-organs utilized for implantation are preferably prepared from an organ tissue of the recipient mammal (i.e. autologous), or a syngeneic mammal, although allogeneic and xenogeneic tissue can also be utilized for the preparation of the micro-organs providing measures are taken prior to, or during implantation, so as to avoid graft rejection and/or graft versus host disease (GVHD). As used herein, GVHD refers to graft versus host disease, a consequence of tissue transplantation (the graft) caused by the transplant immune response against the recipient host. More specifically, graft-versus-host disease is caused by donor T-lymphocytes (T cells), recognizing the recipient as being foreign and attacking cells of the recipient. Numerous methods for preventing or alleviating graft rejection or GVHD are known in the art and may be used in the methods of this invention. In one embodiment, to facilitate transplantation of the cell populations within a tissue which may be subject to immunological attack by the host, e.g., where xenogenic grafting is used, such as swine-human transplantations, the micro-organ may be inserted into or encapsulated by biocompatible immuno-protected material such as rechargeable, non-biodegradable or biodegradable devices and then transplanted into the recipient subject. In another embodiment, the donor micro-organs utilized for implantation are preferably prepared from a donor who is human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched with the recipient, where in one embodiment, HLA is the major histocompatibility complex in humans. In one embodiment, donor and recipient are matched for class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes, class II MHC genes, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, class I MHC genes comprise HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C, wherein in one embodiment, a mismatch of class I MHC genes increases the risk of graft rejection, and in one embodiment, class II MHC genes comprise HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB1, wherein in one embodiment, a mismatch of class II MHC genes increases the risk of GVHD. In another embodiment, donor and recipient are matched for HLA-DM and HLA-DO genes. In one embodiment, viral turnover or elimination from cells ex vivo is enhanced via techniques know in the art, such as physical methods, which in one embodiment is heating, use of antiviral agents, agents which stimulate viral turnovers by cells, etc. In one embodiment, while the long-lasting formulations of the present invention increase the level and duration of nucleic acid or polypeptide expression, the levels of nucleic acid or polypeptide expression do not remain elevated indefinitely. Without being limited by theory, in one embodiment, levels of nucleic acid or polypeptide expressed by the long-lasting formulations of the present invention may decrease as a function of time as a result of the death of differentiated dermal fibroblasts expressing the recombinant nucleic acid or polypeptide. EXAMPLES Experimental Materials and Methods Materials and Equipment List Production medium was used to grow micro-organs and comprises DMEM-HEPES Medium (High glucose 4,500 mg/L and 25 mM HEPES; Hi-Clone Cat# SH3A1448.02) comprising 1% glutamine and supplemented with 50 μg/ml Gentamycin (RAFA labs, for injection) and 0.1% Amphotericin B (BMS, Fungizone I.V.) (final concentration in the media 2.5 μg/ml Amphotericin B). In some experiments, 10% serum substitute supplement (SSS, Irvine Scientific, Cat #99193), 10% autologous human serum, or 10% Fetal bovine serum (FBS or FCS) was added to the production medium. Harvesting of Dermal Micro-Organs-Concentric Needle Method Human dermal micro-organs were harvested from an area of skin from a region of the donor's lower abdomen. To prevent the harvest of the epidermis, a shallow slit (1-2 mm deep) passing through the stratum cornea into the dermis was cut along a straight line at one side of the skin region from which the micro-organs were to be harvested, and a similar slit was cut 30 mm away from and parallel to the first slit. The distance between the slits determined the micro-organ length and was consistent throughout the experiments. A thin gauge (typically 22GA) hypodermic needle attached to a 1 ml syringe filled with sterile saline was inserted into the exposed dermis at the first slit and slid along the dermis of the harvesting site towards the opposite slit, with the needles angled as necessary so that it exited through the dermis at the opposite slit. Next, the outer skin along the length of the guiding needle is pinched with a surgical clamp. The needle embedded in the dermis is lifted slightly to raise the area of skin surrounding it and sometimes a hook shaped device beneath the inserted hypodermic needle's point is used to assist in lifting the skin before it's pinched. The tip of the guide needle protruding from its point of exit, is inserted into the sharp leading end of a coring needle (1-3 mm in diameter, Point Technologies, CO USA), which is held by a commercially available drill (such as Aesculap Micro Speed GD 650, GD 657). A small amount of sterile saline is injected from the syringe into the coring needle. The drill is activated to rotate the coring needle at high speed (typically 3000-7000 RPM) and while rotating, the drill and coring needle are manually urged forward along the axis of the guide needle to cut a 30-40 mm long cylindrical dermal core (dermal micro-organ) having an outer diameter approximately that of the inner diameter of the coring needle. The dermal micro-organ usually remains attached to the guide needle, which is withdrawn from within the coring needle and placed in Production media (as described hereinabove), and the coring needle is removed from the skin. Using tweezers, each micro-organ is transferred to a labeled single well in a 24 well plate containing 1000 μl Production Medium. To remove the debris, two additional media changes of 1000 μl are performed for each micro-organ. The plates containing the micro-organs in 1000 μl production media are then transferred to an incubator that had been equilibrated to 32° C., 10% CO2, and ˜95% humidity for a 24 hr recovery period. Virus Transduction Each micro-organ was transferred for transduction into a well of a 48-well plate, which have smaller wells requiring smaller total fluid volume, to conserve virus. The medium was carefully removed from each well without disturbing the micro-organ inside. During the preclinical experiments, three different vectors were tested: 1.6-3×109 infectious particles (ip)/ml of first generation adenovirus (Molecular Medicine), approximately 3-4×1012 viral particles/ml helper-dependent adenovirus (Baylor), or approximately 2×1011 viral particles/ml adeno-associated virus (University of Pennsylvania), each comprising recombinant human EPO gene, optimized recombinant human EPO gene, or optimized IFN-alpha gene, were each diluted 1:10, 1:25, 1:50, 1:100, 1:500, or 1:1000 in DMEM-HEPES (Gibco Cat #42430-025) with or without FCS. Each well of the 48-well plates was filled with 100 μL of one of the diluted titers of a virus. The plate was placed in a CO2 incubator and transduction was assisted by agitation on a digital microtiter shaker at 300 rpm for a period of 2 hours and an additional 16-22 hour incubation without shaking. The transduced micro-organs were transferred to a 24-well plate after transduction and then washed three times with 1 mL production media (without FCS) to remove the non-transduced viral particles. After washing, the biopumps were maintained in 1 mL production media in a standard high humidity CO2 incubator at 95% humidity, 10% CO2, and 32° C. Seventy-two hours after the removal of the viral vector, the production medium was replaced with fresh medium, and aliquots of the spent medium were assayed for secreted recombinant protein levels. Ex Vivo Micro-Organ Maintenance Every 3-4 days, used production media was collected, and the level of the secreted recombinant protein and glucose level were assessed along with the viability of the biopumps. Fresh Production media was added to the 24-well plate. Secreted Protein Measurements Human EPO (hEPO) and IFNα concentration and secretion levels were assayed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Quantikine human erythropoietin; R&D Systems; Human interferon alpha ELISA kit, PBL Biomedical Laboratories), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Glucose Measurements Tissue glucose consumption was evaluated using Sigma-Aldrich Corporation GAGO20 Glucose (GO) Assay Kit, according to manufacturer's instructions. Hematocrit Measurements Tissue glucose consumption was evaluated using Sigma-Aldrich Corporation GAGO20 Glucose (GO) Assay Kit, according to manufacturer's instructions. Hematocrit levels were assayed using centrifugation using the reference method recommended by The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS), as is known in the art. To determine the hematocrit, whole blood in a tube was centrifuged at 10-15,000×g for 5 minutes to pellet the red cells (called packed erythrocytes), and the ratio of the column of packed erythrocytes to the total length of the sample in the capillary tube was measured with a graphic reading device within 10 minutes of centrifugation. Micro-Organ Implantation In some experiments, genetically modified or control micro-organs were implanted subcutaneously in Severe Combined ImmunoDeficiency (SCID) mice after assaying tissue glucose consumption to ascertain that micro-organs were viable. Male and female SCID mice weighing around 25 grams were anaesthetized with 140 μl of diluted Ketaset (ketamine HCl) (400 μl Ketaset and 600 μl saline) and control or EPO-expressing micro-organs were implanted subcutaneously ten days following micro-organ transduction. Example 1 EPO and IFNα Levels Produced in Vitro by GMMOs Micro-organs were prepared as described above and transduced with a helper-dependent adenoviral vector expressing an optimzed IFNα gene linked to a CAG promoter, as described above. GMMOs were then maintained in culture, and the levels of IFNα produced were evaluated by ELISA. Optimized IFNα-expressing micro-organs produced greater than 1000 ng/day of IFNα in vitro (FIG. 1) for at least 40 days post-harvesting, and recombinant hEPO-expressing micro-organs produced greater than 1000 ng/day of hEPO in vitro (FIGS. 2A-B) for at least 142 days post-harvesting. GMMOs comprising a gutless adenovirus vector encoding optimized HEPO maintained higher percentages of peak expression for more than 200 days compared to micro-organs comprising an adenovirus-5 vector encoding hEPO (FIG. 3). Micro-organs comprising a gutless adenovirus vector encoding optimized hEPO also maintained a higher percentage of peak expression for a longer period of time than micro-organs comprising a gutless adenovirus vector encoding non-optimized hEPO (FIG. 4). Finally, micro-organs comprising a gutless adenovirus vector encoding hEPO downstream of a CAG promoter showed higher levels of hEPO expression, which grew more pronounced as a function of post-transduction day, compared to micro-organs comprising a gutless adenovirus vector encoding hEPO downstream of a CMV promoter (FIG. 5). Example 2 EPO Levels Produced by Human EPO-Expressing GMMOs Maintained In Vitro and in Serum of Implanted SCID Mice EPO-expressing micro-organs were prepared as described above. After a total of nine days in culture, the amount of EPO produced per micro-organ was measured, and this value was used to determine that each mouse was implanted with micro-organs expressing equivalent levels of EPO. On the tenth day, two micro-organs were implanted subcutaneously into each SCID mouse and on the first measurement taken after ten days, levels of hEPO measured in the serum of the SCID mice were significantly above baseline levels. The levels remained high at least 216 days post-implantation and significantly raised hematocrit levels in SCID mice for at least 157 days (FIG. 6A). Non-implanted EPO-expressing micro-organs produced from the same donor at the same time as the implanted EPO-expressing micro-organs but maintained in vitro continuously maintained high levels of EPO production (FIG. 6B). Micro-organs transduced with vectors comprising optimized hEPO gene produced higher levels of EPO than those transduced with recombinant HEPO gene both in vivo (FIG. 6A) and in vitro (FIG. 6B). Control SCID mice implanted with non-EPO-producing micro-organs showed no increase of serum EPO levels and no significant changes in hematocrit levels after micro-organ implantation compared to pre-implantation (FIG. 6A). Micro-organs comprising EPO-expressing adenovirus-5, which was used as a positive control, was used at a titer of 1:10 compared to a titer of 1:100 for micro-organs comprising EPO-expressing optimized or non-optimized gutless adenovirus. Example 3 EPO Levels Produced in Genetically Modified Micro-Organ-Implanted Human in Clinical Trials Clinical trials are performed as described previously (Lippin et al., 2005, Blood 106(7):2280-6, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) except that the micro-organ will be harvested and genetically modified as described hereinabove. Phase I clinical trials are performed in Israel in which pre-dialysis anemic patients with chronic kidney disease are implanted with autologous hEPO-GMMOs of the sustained type of the present invention. A single implantation treatment with GMMO-hEPO is expected to provide 4-6 months of effective EPO therapy. Approval for the Phase I/II GMMO hEPO trial is approved by Israel's Ministry of Health and is conducted at the Hadassah Medical facility. All steps regarding the required regulatory and clinical standards are coordinated with the FDA, in order to facilitate US based clinical trials. In preparation for the planned clinical trial, the required preclinical toxicological studies in SCID mice are performed. These studies are performed as was described previously (Brill-Almon et al. Molecular Therapy 12(2), 274-282) with the additional timepoints longer than 20 days. The HD-Ad-hEPO vector for the clinical trial is prepared in an FDA GMP compliant facility to be compliant with the FDA guidelines (GMP) as required for its use in patients. The GMMOs are implanted for four to six months, and then removed or ablated at the termination of the trial, or extended if so requested by the PI with the approval of the ethics committee. As shown in Table 1, the toxicology study comprises three groups of SCID mice, with an equal numbers of male and female subjects. Due to the high mortality of SCID mice, a large number of animals are included in each group. TABLE 1 Experimental Design # # # GMMO Total # sacrificed sacrificed sacrificed Dose of mice @8 wks @ 16 wks @ 24 wks 100-150 30 5M, 5M, 5M, IU Epo/day (17M, 17F) 5F 5F 5F 300-450 30 5M, 5M, 5M, IU Epo/day (17M, 17F) 5F 5F 5F Control - 30 5M, 5M, 5M, non transduced (17M, 17F) 5F 5F 5F In the first group, each animal receives at most a single dermal 30 mm HEPO GMMO or more likely a portion of a GMMO that secretes in the range of 100-150 IU EPO/day. Since each mouse weighs approximately 25 grams, this dose equals 4,000-6000 IU/day per kg mouse (25 fold or greater than the highest expected dose proposed to implant in human patients). The size of the implanted tissue generally corresponds to at least ¼ of a whole GMMO due to the small size of the GMMO and its impact on its handling. In the second group, each animal receives at most a single dermal 30 mm hEPO GMMO or more likely a portion of a GMMO that will secrete in the range of 300-450 IU EPO/day. Since a mouse weighs approximately 25 grams, this dose equals 12,000-18,000 IU/day per kg mouse (80-120 fold or greater than the highest expected dose proposed to implant in human patients). In the third group, a control group, each animal receives one third (10 mm) of a 30 mm dermal non-transduced GMMO. Dosing Rationale: GMMO-hEPO dosing before implantation is controlled by adjusting the numbers or the size of the GMMOs after measuring the actual daily amount of protein produced by the GMMO in vitro. In the experimental protocol outlined above, the micro-organs are transduced with a viral titer that is similar to the one which we use in the clinical trial, thereby exposing the cells in the GMMO to a similar multiplicity of infection. The typical levels of secreted hEPO produced by these GMMOs are in the range of 300-1000 IU/Biopump per day. Therefore, the lowest amount of EPO expected to be secreted from ⅓ BP corresponding to 1.0 cm and ⅔ BPs corresponding to 2.0 cm is approximately 100 and 200 IU, respectively. The dose may be lowered in the mice by implanting fragments shorter than 0.5 cm. Based on the results of our previous clinical trial, approximately 1500-3500 IU/70 kg patient (or 1-3 GMMOs) are expected to be adequate to cause sustained production of reticulocytes and the resulting elevation of hematocrit. Thus, 100 IU of EPO secreted from a single GMMO or a fragment of a GMMO implanted in a 25 gr mouse, is at least 25 fold or greater the highest expected dose that we propose to implant in human patients. Thus, using at least ¼ of a GMMO in this study provides a sufficient safety margin to test the toxicological effects of GMMO-EPO in the mice and support the clinical dose. As we've demonstrated, hEPO secretion levels from multiple human abdominal skin sample GMMOs were approximately 300→1000 IU/day. While secretion levels from GMMOs from the same skin samples were similar, the variability between different skin samples was higher. As we have demonstrated the dosing variability is addressed before the GMMOs are implanted in the mice by measuring the secretion levels in vitro before implantation. The entire study, except histology, will be done under GLP. Histology slides will be reviewed blind by a board certified pathologist. Tests to be performed include: Clinical signs: Daily Body weight: Every other day Organ weights: heart, liver, kidney, spleen, brain, thymus (if it can be found) will be determined at terminal sacrifice Clinical chemistry: At terminal sacrifice Full hematology profile: At terminal sacrifice. To include serum hEPO levels and hematocrit. Clinical pathology: At terminal sacrifice Histology including: implantation site, liver, kidney, lymph nodes, heart, spleen, bone marrow, and any lesions found at necropsy and bone marrow will be performed at terminal sacrifice All other organs will be preserved for future analysis In contrast to other methods involving transient transduction of cells, or cells that turn over rapidly, the long-lasting EPO formulation of the instant invention comprises cells that are no longer replicating. Therefore, the EPO formulation produces a stable protein from a stable construct and is expected to continue producing the protein already characterized. 1.
