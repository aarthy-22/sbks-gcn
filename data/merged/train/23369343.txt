Evaluation of in vivo anti-hyperglycemic and antioxidant potentials of α-santalol and sandalwood oil.
Sandalwood finds numerous mentions across diverse traditional medicinal systems in use worldwide.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the in vivo anti-hyperglycemic and antioxidant potential of sandalwood oil and its major constituent α-santalol.
The in vivo anti-hyperglycemic experiment was conducted in alloxan-induced diabetic male Swiss albino mice models.
The in vivo antioxidant experiment was performed in d-galactose mediated oxidative stress induced male Swiss albino mice models.
Intraperitoneal administration of α-santalol (100mg/kg BW) and sandalwood oil (1g/kg BW) for an week modulated parameters such as body weight, blood glucose, serum bilirubin, liver glycogen, and lipid peroxides contents to normoglycemic levels in the alloxan-induced diabetic mice.
Similarly, intraperitoneal administration of α-santalol (100mg/kg BW) and sandalwood oil (1g/kg BW) for two weeks modulated parameters such as serum aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, superoxide dismutase, catalase, free sulfhydryl, protein carbonyl, nitric oxide, liver lipid peroxide contents, and antioxidant capacity in d-galactose mediated oxidative stress induced mice.
Besides, it was observed that the beneficial effects of α-santalol were well complimented, differentially by other constituents present in sandalwood oil, thus indicating synergism in biological activity of this traditionally used bioresource.
