Long-term efficacy and safety of anastrozole for adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer in postmenopausal women.
For more than 20 years, tamoxifen has been the gold standard for the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone-responsive early breast cancer.
However, recent randomized trials have shown efficacy and tolerability benefits with the third-generation aromatase inhibitor anastrozole, resulting in an increased use of this agent in the adjuvant setting.
Data on anastrozole's long-term efficacy and tolerability are therefore of interest in clinical practice and will be reviewed here, especially in the light of the 100-month analysis of the ATAC (Anastrozole, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination) trial.
