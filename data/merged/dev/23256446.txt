Metabolic effects of honey in type 1 diabetes mellitus: a randomized crossover pilot study.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the metabolic effects of 12-week honey consumption on patients suffering from type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM).
This was a randomized crossover clinical trial done in the National Institute for Diabetes and Endocrinology, Cairo, Egypt.
Twenty patients of both sexes aged 4-18 years with type 1 DM and HbA1C<10% participated in the study.
They were randomized into two equal groups (intervention to control and control to intervention).
The dietary intervention was 12-week honey consumption in a dose of 0.5 mL/kg body weight per day.
The main outcome measures were serum glucose, lipids, and C-peptide, and anthropometric measurements.
None of participants were lost in follow-up.
The intervention resulted in significant decreases in subscapular skin fold thickness (SSFT; P=.002), fasting serum glucose (FSG; P=.001), total cholesterol (P=.0001), serum triglycerides (TG; P=.0001), and low-density lipoprotein (P=.0009), and significant increases in fasting C-peptide (FCP; P=.0004) and 2-h postprandial C-peptide (PCP; P=.002).
As possible long-term effects of honey after its withdrawal, statistically significant reductions in midarm circumference (P=.000), triceps skin fold thickness (P=.006), SSFT (P=.003), FSG (P=.005), 2-h postprandial serum glucose (P=.000), TG (P=.003), and HbA1C (P=.043), and significant increases in FCP (P=.002) and PCP (P=.003) were observed.
This small clinical trial suggests that long-term consumption of honey might have positive effects on the metabolic derangements of type 1 DM.
