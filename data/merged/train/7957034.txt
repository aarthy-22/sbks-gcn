Quantification of opiate receptors in two patients with mesiobasal temporal lobe epilepsy, before and after selective amygdalohippocampectomy, using positron emission tomography.
Using PET, reduced glucose metabolism (rCMRglu) and increased binding of the mu opiate receptor ligand 11C-carfentanil have been demonstrated in lateral temporal cortex overlying mesial temporal epileptic foci.
Binding of the non-specific opiate receptor ligand 11C-diprenorphine (DPN) to lateral temporal cortex has not shown consistent asymmetries.
We measured rCMRglu with 18F-FDG and binding of 11C-diprenorphine in two patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) before and 5 months after selective amygdalo-hippocampectomy (both patients were seizure-free post-operatively).
Pre-operatively, in both patients rCMRglu was decreased in mesial temporal lobe (MTL) (asymmetry index AI = -9.1 and 9.0) ipsilateral to the EEG focus.
A more marked reduction was seen in ipsilateral lateral temporal cortex (LTC) (AI = -32.0 and 18.9).
DPN binding was reduced in MTL and LTC (AI MTL = -9.3 and 16.2; AI LTC = -8.0 and 5.5) ipsilateral to the focus, but was within 2 SD of the normal range.
Post-operatively, the reduction of rCMRglu in LTC was accentuated in one patient and decreased in the other (AI = -23.1 and 45.7) while there was a further reduction of DPN binding in LTC in both patients (AI = -27.8 and 9.8).
These preliminary results in only two patients are compatible with downregulation of opiate receptors in LTC after removal of the epileptic focus or post-operative neuronal dysfunction.
