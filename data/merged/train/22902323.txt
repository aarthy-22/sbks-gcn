High levels of arachidonic acid and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha in breast cancer tissues are associated with promoting cancer cell proliferation.
Fatty acids are endogenous ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARα), which is linked to the regulation of fatty acid uptake, lipid metabolism and breast cancer cell growth.
This study was designed to screen candidate fatty acids from breast cancer tissue and to investigate the effects of these candidate fatty acids on PPARα expression, cell growth and cell cycle progression in breast cancer cell lines.
One breast cancer tissue and one reference tissue were each taken from 30 individual breasts to examine for fatty acid composition and PPARα expression.
The cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 (ER-), MCF-7 (ER++++) and BT-474 (ER++) were used to explore the mechanisms regulating cell proliferation.
We found that arachidonic acid (AA) and PPARα were highly expressed in the breast cancer tissues.
AA stimulated the growth of all three breast cancer cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner.
The growth stimulatory effect of AA was associated with PPARα activation, and the most potent effect was found in MCF-7 cells.
The stimulation of cell proliferation by AA was accompanied by the increased expression of cyclin E, a reduced population of G1 phase cells, and a faster G1/S phase transition.
In contrast, AA had no effects on the levels of CDK2, CDK4, cyclin D1, p27, Bcl-2 and Bax.
Our results demonstrate that high levels of AA and PPARα expression in human breast cancer tissues are associated with ER-overexpressed breast cancer cell proliferation, which is involved in activating PPARα, stimulating cyclin E expression, and promoting faster G1/S transition.
