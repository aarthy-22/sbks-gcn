Two novel mutations in the MEN1 gene in subjects with multiple endocrine neoplasia-1.
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is characterized by parathyroid, enteropancreatic endocrine and pituitary adenomas as well as germline mutation of the MEN1 gene.
We describe 2 families with MEN1 with novel mutations in the MEN1 gene.
One family was of Turkish origin, and the index patient had primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) plus a prolactinoma; three relatives had PHPT only.
The index patient in the second family was a 46-yr-old woman of Chinese origin living in Taiwan.
This patient presented with a complaint of epigastric pain and watery diarrhea over the past 3 months, and had undergone subtotal parathyroidectomy and enucleation of pancreatic islet cell tumor about 10 yr before.
There was also a prolactinoma.
Sequence analysis of the MEN1 gene from leukocyte genomic DNA revealed heterozygous mutations in both probands.
The Turkish patient and her affected relatives all had a heterozygous A to G transition at codon 557 (AAG-->GAG) of exon 10 of MEN1 that results in a replacement of lysine by glutamic acid.
The Chinese index patient and one of her siblings had a heterozygous mutation at codon 418 of exon 9 (GAC-->TAT) that results in a substitution of aspartic acid by tyrosine.
In conclusion, we have identified 2 novel missense mutations in the MEN1 gene.
