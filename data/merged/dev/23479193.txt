Synthesis and in-silico studies of some diaryltriazole derivatives as potential cyclooxygenase inhibitors.
The synthesis of several 4-phenyl-5-pyridin-4-yl-2,3-dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiones possessing N-2 Mannich bases or S-alkyl substituents, is reported.
Several of them exhibited a low nanomolar COX enzyme inhibition activity.
Most of the compounds showed inhibition of edema was similar to that evoked by celocoxib in animal model.
Molecular docking studies of the compounds into the binding sites of COX-1 and COX-2 allowed us to shed light on the binding mode of these novel COX inhibitors.
