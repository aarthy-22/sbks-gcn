Specific inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 by PD 0332991 and associated antitumor activity in human tumor xenografts.
PD 0332991 is a highly specific inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4) (IC50, 0.011 micromol/L) and Cdk6 (IC50, 0.016 micromol/L), having no activity against a panel of 36 additional protein kinases.
It is a potent antiproliferative agent against retinoblastoma (Rb)-positive tumor cells in vitro, inducing an exclusive G1 arrest, with a concomitant reduction of phospho-Ser780/Ser795 on the Rb protein.
Oral administration of PD 0332991 to mice bearing the Colo-205 human colon carcinoma produces marked tumor regression.
Therapeutic doses of PD 0332991 cause elimination of phospho-Rb and the proliferative marker Ki-67 in tumor tissue and down-regulation of genes under the transcriptional control of E2F.
The results indicate that inhibition of Cdk4/6 alone is sufficient to cause tumor regression and a net reduction in tumor burden in some tumors.
