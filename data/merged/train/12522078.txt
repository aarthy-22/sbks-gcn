Evidence against beta 3-adrenoceptors or low affinity state of beta 1-adrenoceptors mediating relaxation in rat isolated aorta.
1 The presence of beta(3)-adrenoceptors and the low affinity state of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor (formerly "putative beta(4)-adrenoceptor") was investigated in ring preparations of rat isolated aorta preconstricted with phenylephrine or prostaglandin F(2alpha) (PGF(2alpha)).
Relaxant responses to isoprenaline, selective beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonists (BRL 37344, SR 58611A, CL 316243) and non-conventional partial agonists (CGP 12177A, cyanopindolol, pindolol) were obtained.
2 In phenylephrine-constricted, but not PGF(2alpha)-constricted rings, relaxations to isoprenaline showed a propranolol-resistant component.
3 In phenylephrine-constricted rings, relaxations to BRL 37344 (pEC(50), 4.64) and SR 58611A (pEC(50), 4.94) were not antagonized by the selective beta(3)-adrenoceptor antagonist SR 59230A (< or =1 microM).
CL 316243 (< or =100 microM) failed to produce relaxation.
In PGF(2alpha)-constricted rings only SR 58611A produced relaxation, which was not affected by SR 59230A (< or =3 microM).
4 Non-conventional partial agonists produced relaxation in phenylephrine-constricted but not PGF(2alpha)-constricted rings.
The relaxation to CGP 12177A was unaffected by SR 59230A (< or =1 microM) or by CGP 20712A (10 microM), reported to block the low affinity state of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor.
5 beta-adrenoceptor antagonists also produced relaxation in phenylephrine-constricted rings with an order of potency of (pEC(50) values): bupranolol (5.5) approximately 38;SR 59230A (5.47) approximately 38;cyanopindolol (5.47)>pindolol (5.30)>alprenolol (5.10)>propranolol (4.83)>ICI 118551 (4.60)>CGP 12177A (4.38) approximately 38;CGP 20712A (4.35).
Bupranolol (100 microM), alprenolol (30 microM), propranolol (100 microM) and SR 59230A (10 microM) produced no relaxation in PGF(2alpha)-constricted rings.
6 These results provide no evidence for the presence of functional beta(3)-adrenoceptors or the low affinity state of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor in rat aorta.
