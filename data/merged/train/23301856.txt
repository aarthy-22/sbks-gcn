In vitro evaluation of (99m)Tc-EDDA/tricine-HYNIC-Q-Litorin in gastrin-releasing peptide receptor positive tumor cell lines.
Abstract Bombesin and its derivatives exhibit a high affinity for gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPr), which is over-expressed in a variety of human cancers (prostate, pancreatic, lung, etc.).
The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro potential of the hydrazinonicotinamide (HYNIC)-Q-Litorin.
(99m)Tc labeling was performed by using different co-ligands: tricine and ethylenediamine diacetic acid (EDDA).
The radiochemical stability of radiolabeled peptide conjugates was checked at room temperature and in cysteine solution up to 24 h. The in vitro cell uptake of (99m)Tc-EDDA-HYNIC-Q-Litorin and (99m)Tc-tricine-HYNIC-Q-Litorin were evaluated on pancreatic tumor and control cell lines.
Optimum specific activity and incubation time were determined for all the cell lines.
The results showed that the cell uptake of the radiolabeled peptide conjugates in tumor cell lines were higher than in the control cell line.
The findings of this study indicated the need for further development of in vivo study as a radiopharmaceutical for pancreatic tumor imaging.
