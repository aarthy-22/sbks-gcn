This invention relates to the field of systems and plants for the waste water treatment. More in detail, the invention concerns a process for the thermophilic aerobic treatment of concentrated organic waste water and a plant in which said process is implemented. The best available techniques (BAT) in use today, as identified by currently applicable standards for plants for the chemical-physical and biological treatment of fluid waste, indicate an ample choice of suitable processes and plants. Where possible, biological processes are generally preferred in the case of treating biodegradable organic sewage. A system with an aerobic process involving activated sludge is commonly used because it is the best known and considered reliable. Alternatives to the activated sludge process, such as systems using adherent biomass, cannot boast these characteristics. Suitable processes include the following techniques in particular, which are classified as BAT: sedimentation/flocculation;microfiltration and ultrafiltration;reverse osmosis and nanofiltration;precipitation;chemical oxidation;aerobic treatments. More in particular, thermophilic aerobic biological plants are commonly used to treat sewage with a high organic matter content. Thermophilic aerobic biological systems (for treating sewage with a high organic matter content) are based on processes at temperatures higher than 45°C. To reach this temperature cost-effectively, it is generally possible to resort to one of two alternatives: 1. the use of already heated water coming from particular production processes, such as papermaking industries;2. the use of sewage with a high content of organic matter; organic matter degradation reactions are exothermal, so the temperature valves can be maintained without needing to provide a source of heat, simply by ensuring certain conditions, i.e.: a sufficient concentration of biodegradable organic matter;an adequate thermal insulation of the reactor. Finally, it is well known that fluidized-bed reactors can be used with an inert substance suitable to serve as a diffuse supporting medium for the adherent bacterial flora that develops during the biological process. A particular problem when using thermophilic processes concerns the poor sedimentability characteristics of the sludge: this makes it difficult to clarify the effluent difficult and limits the efficiency of the treatment. The cause of the problem lies in the limited capacity of the biomass to form clumps, which in turn is due to a shortage of clump-forming bacteria, which find it difficult to develop in an environment that is not ideally suited to them, as in the case of biological reactors operating at high temperatures. One known solution to overcome this problem is to adopt a filtering system (e.g. ultrafiltration) downstream from the fluidized-bed reactor in order to separate the biomass from the treated sewage. The resulting biological system, equipped with such a filtering unit, is called membrane biological reactor (MBR). On the other hand, the problems deriving from the use of fluidised beds substantially relate to the need to artificially supply the inert substrate at the beginning of the process and also afterwards due to the entrainment of the material in the overflow of sludge passing through the outlet from the reactor. The currently-used techniques and plants generally also have numerous other drawbacks, including: the need for large volumes and the occupation of large spaces;the potential to produce smelly gaseous emissions;a high sludge output;difficulties with treating scarcely biodegradable synthesis organic matter. Document US 2004/159607 A1 discloses a process of aerobic treatment of sewage in mesophile conditions where granules of calcite are used as support for the aerobic micro-organisms. Document JPA08232595 discloses the use of Ca compounds added in a processing method of organic nature sewage by an upflow type anaerobic sludge floor method, that react with the carbon dioxide generated by methane fermentation within a reactor, producing CaCO3. Aim of the present invention is a process for the thermophilic aerobic treatment of concentrated organic waste water and a plant in which said process is implemented, that relies on techniques classifiable as BAT, and that overcomes the problems still characterizing said conventional techniques. In particular, aim of the invention is to offer a process based on a fluidised-bed reactor using a device of the MBR type that overcomes the problems of the sludge's sedimentability, wherein there is no more need to artificially supply the inert substance used as a diffuse supporting medium for the adherent bacterial flora that develops during the biological process. Further aims include: reducing the volumes and the spaces necessary to implement the treatment process; avoiding the emission of smelly gases from the plant; reducing the output of sludge from the plant; and enabling the cost-effective treatment of scarcely biodegradable synthesis organic matter. These aims are achieved by the present invention by means of a process for the thermophilic aerobic treatment of concentrated organic waste water according to the independent claim 1. Further features of the process are contained in the dependent claims 2-5. The invention also concerns a plant for the thermophilic aerobic treatment of concentrated organic waste water as claimed in the independent claim 6. Further features of the plant are contained in the dependent claims 7-10. In addition to the known advantages of using a thermophilic aerobic process with an adherent biomass, i.e. high reaction rates, reduced reactor volumes, flexibility, overload resistance, process stability, reduced outputs of already well stabilised sludge, more straightforward equipment in the plant than in conventional sludge treatment lines, the advantages of the procedure and of the plant according to the invention also include the following: the abatement of part of the carbon dioxide developed by the organic matter degradation process and its conversion into calcium carbonate due to its reaction with the lime added during the process; the degree to which the CO2 developed by the treatment process is abated can be controlled by adjusting the quantity of lime supplied to the thermophilic reactor and the equivalent removal of the calcium carbonate, so as to stabilize the preset operating value for the total solids in suspension in the fluidized bed;the formation of calcium carbonate that enables a natural inert supporting medium to be obtained cost effectively for the adherent biomass, which does not need topping up;the containment of gaseous smelly emissions and their easier extraction thanks to the more limited dimensions of the reactor;the reduction of the gas flow rates involved and consequently of the stripping phenomena thanks to the use of pure oxygen instead of air, which also enables the system to be operated with very high dissolved oxygen concentrations (4-8 mg/L); values that could also be obtained using air insufflation systems, but the operating costs would be prohibitive. This equates to the creation of high concentration gradients, which act as a "driving force" for the transfer of oxygen between the liquid environment and the innermost parts of the clumps of sludge, which are generally poor in oxygen. The oxygen can penetrate inside the mass of the clumps of sludge much more efficiently than in air-insufflated systems. The microorganisms are thus ideally supplied with oxygen, so they can achieve the degradation of the organic matter contained in the sewage to maximum effect;the problem of the limited sedimentability of the thermophilic sludge is overcome thanks to the membrane filtering system (ultrafiltration) located downstream from the "natural" fluidised-bed thermophilic biological system, which can also be followed by other treatments of known type;inhibition of the pathogens, an aspect that may be fundamental in the treatment of certain types of sewage, such as those deriving from animal husbandry activities;the opportunity to retrieve heat;the development of bacteria suitable for the treatment process irrespective of the morphology and clumping capacity of the sludge, which leads to more effective biodegradation levels;a high capacity for degradation even of synthesis molecules, which are not easily biodegradable in conventional biological plants;the effluent from the thermophilic reactor is suitable for subsequent mesophilic biological treatment;the sludge coming from the thermophilic reactor can be reused in farming applications because it consists mainly of calcium carbonate (which has a natural corrective and stabilising action on soil pH, even in areas with acid rains) and of stabilised organic matter containing no pathogens, accumulable bioresistant organic matter, and heavy metals. The advantages of the invention will become more evident from the description that follows, in which preferred embodiments are described as non-limiting examples with the aid of the figures, wherein: Fig. 1 schematically shows the basic concept behind the process and the plant according to the invention;Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5 show examples of more complex variants of the process illustrated in Fig. 1;Fig. 6 shows a detail of the plant for implementing the basic process according to the invention;Fig. 7 provides experimental data on the monthly efficiency in removing the COD, obtained using the processing options shown in Figs. 1-2 and 3.Fig. 8 compares the experimental data for the COD loads in the water at the thermophilic reactor inlet and after its abatement in a reactor made according to the invention, pooled for two monitoring periods. With reference to Figure 1, the basic concentrated organic waste water treatment process comprises the following steps: said waste water QIN is fed for fluidized-bed thermophilic aerobic biological treatment inside a closed reactor 1 with a system for thermostatic temperature control 2 based on an internal or external heat exchanger (using hot water, for instance), and a hydraulic recirculation system 3;said water subsequently undergoes an ultrafiltration treatment 4;pure oxygen O2 is insufflated inside said reactor 1;lime Ca(OH)2 is provided for the fluidized-bed thermophilic aerobic biological treatment;said treated waste water QOUT is subsequently discharged. The lime Ca(OH)2 available in the reactor 1 is suitable for forming a natural inert supporting medium consisting of microparticles of calcium carbonate CaCO3 by means of a process of carbonation with carbon dioxide CO2 generated by the degradation of the organic substrate in the biological process. Said microparticles are suitable for providing a considerable surface area arranged for allowing development of an adherent aerobic bacterial flora. The ultrafiltration treatment 4, which is achieved with the membrane equipment of known type, enables the biomass to be kept inside the reactor 1 while the flow QOUT of treated water is discharged. The lime Ca(OH)2 is dosed either directly at the thermophilic biological treatment step, as shown in Figure 1, or at a previous chemical-physical re-treatment step inside a mix contact reactor 5, as shown in Figure 2. In a further variant of the process shown in Figure 3, there is an nanofiltration treatment 6 conducted according to a known technique downstream from the ultrafiltration treatment 4. Figure 4 shows another variant of the process, wherein a mesophilic activated sludge treatment comprising a treatment step in a mesophilic reactor 7 and a sedimentation step in a sedimentation tank 8 is adopted as an alternative to the membrane type nanofiltration system 6 in series with the ultrafiltration treatment 4. The combined thermophilic/mesophilic biological treatment enables a further reduction in COD and BOD5 of approximately 40% and 80%, respectively. Figure 5 shows a variant, as a further example, wherein a chemical oxidation treatment OX 9 is inserted on the recirculation line carrying the concentrate coming from nanofiltration 6, the object of which is to increase the biodegradability of the sewage and consequently enable its recirculation in the biological reactor 1 rather than in the chemical-physical treatment compartment 5. The treatment 9 may be of known type, e.g. with the addition of nitrogen or with a process based on hydrogen peroxide and UV radiation. The chemical oxidation treatment could also be included in other points of the plant (in the basic configuration of Fig. 1, or in one of the variants of Figs. 2-4), also for the purpose of protecting the second (mesophilic) biological treatment against any incoming toxic/inhibiting matter and/or to improve the efficiency of the removal of organic matter, and/or to increase the biodegradability of the sewage. With reference to the figures, a description is given below of a plant that implements the basic process for the thermophilic aerobic treatment of concentrated organic waste water, together with the corresponding alternative solutions and some data on the efficiency achieved. Remarkable results were obtained using a biological tank 1 operating in thermophilic conditions (T > 45°C) maintained by means of a heat exchanger 2 and made of reinforced concrete with walls 30 cm thick covered with prefabricated panels in order to contain the smells and maintain the temperature. The thermophilic biological reactor 1 has a surface area of 267 m2 (21 m x 12.8 m) and it is 5.3 m high, 1.5 m of which are below ground, providing a total useful volume of approximately 1000 m3. The biological reactor 1 is fed with an incoming flow QIN at a rate of 8.3 m3/h and has a recirculating flow QMBR (at a rate) of 120 m3/h coming from the ultrafiltration treatment 4, thus constituting a MBR type treatment system. The biological oxidation system uses pure oxygen (added in the form of microbubbles using the known OXY-DEP system); this ensures an effective oxidation, reducing the stripping action of the smelly gases, and enabling peak oxygen demands due to overloading to be met. With reference in particular to Figure 6, the pure oxygen is injected directly into static mixers 10 (QO2, 75 m3/h) so as to oversaturate the recirculating sewage inside them at a flow rate QOX of 300 m3/h, both to guarantee the supply to the fluidized bed and to enable the delivery of oxygen to the reactor 1. The fluid thus contains microbubbles of oxygen finely dispersed within its mass in larger quantities than in conventional systems. The sewage thus enriched is then returned to the tank through the liquid-liquid ejectors 11, in sufficient quantity to bring the whole flow of fluid leaving the ejector up to the saturation values corresponding to the pressure of the hydrostatic head in the tank. This makes it possible to exploit said hydrostatic head to keep the oxygen in contact with the fluid for as long as possible, and also to ensure the adequate agitation of the sewage and of the fluidized bed with an even distribution of the dissolved gas. The thermophilic treatment is fed with a supply of waste water QIN from industrial processes or the percolate from landfills at a neutral pH with a high content of organic matter, nitrogen and other liquid waste. The following table shows the minimum, maximum and mean levels of the main polluting parameters characteristic of the sewage delivered to the thermophilic biological compartment.

These efficiencies were achieved using a plant of the MBR type, as shown in Figure 2, and a plant of the type shown in Figure 3. The efficiencies obtained were as follows: in the former case (Ox + UF), the efficiency in removing the COD was 81% in the first period and 72% in the second;in the latter case (Ox + UF + NF), the efficiency in removing the COD was 89% in the second test period only. Figure 8 shows a comparison between the COD loads at the inlet and after abatement in the thermophilic reactor during the above-mentioned two monitoring periods. Clearly, despite the increment in the organic load at the inlet, the abated organic load remains nearly the same.
