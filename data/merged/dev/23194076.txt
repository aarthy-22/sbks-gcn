Diet, physical exercise and Orlistat administration increase serum Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) levels in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
The present study investigates the combined effect of diet, physical exercise and Orlistat for 24 weeks, on serum Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) levels in overweight and obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and in overweight and obese controls.
Sixty-one (61) selected women with PCOS and 20 overweight and obese controls followed an energy-restricted diet, physical exercise plus Orlistat administration (120 mg, 3 times per day) for 24 weeks.
At baseline, week 12 and week 24, serum levels of AMH, FSH, LH, PRL, androgens, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), glucose, and insulin were measured and Free Androgen Index (FAI) and Insulin Resistance (IR) indices were calculated.
In PCOS women, serum AMH levels increased after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment.
After 12 weeks LH and SHBG were increased, while Testosterone decreased.
After 12 and 24 weeks, FAI was decreased and all indices of IR were significantly improved.
We concluded that in overweight and obese women with PCOS Orlistat administration, combined with diet and physical exercise, for 24 weeks, resulted in significant weight loss, improvement of hyperandrogenism and insulin sensitivity, and increased serum AMH levels.
