Tamoxifen and fluoxymesterone versus tamoxifen and danazol in metastatic breast cancer--a randomized study.
A prospective randomized trial of tamoxifen and fluoxymesterone versus tamoxifen and danazol in metastatic breast cancer was conducted from December 1980 to September 1985.
Patients were eligible regardless of site of disease, estrogen receptor status, or age.
Sixty-two of sixty-three randomized patients were evaluable for response.
Overall response for tamoxifen and fluoxymesterone was 11% with 61% stabilization of disease, versus 12% response rate for tamoxifen and danazol with 59% stabilization.
Toxicities with tamoxifen and fluoxymesterone were greater with an increase in masculinization.
We conclude that the response rates to the combinations of tamoxifen and fluoxymesterone or tamoxifen and danazol reported are equivalent in this study but that the increased toxicity with tamoxifen and fluoxymesterone would make tamoxifen and danazol the treatment of choice if a combination were to be used.
