Vapreotide: a somatostatin analog for the treatment of acute variceal bleeding.
BACKGROUND: Portal hypertension is a clinically important consequence of cirrhosis that can lead to morbidities such as variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy and ascites.
All of these outcomes carry high mortality rates.
There have been several drugs created to assist with endoscopic therapy for the treatment of acute variceal bleeding.
Recently, vapreotide has been studied in patients to evaluate its efficacy as treatment for acute variceal hemorrhage.
Although no comparisons have been made between vapreotide and other somatostatin analogues, this drug has been shown to have efficacy in the control of acute variceal bleeding as well as reducing the risk of recurrent bleeding and death, especially when started prior to endoscopy.
OBJECTIVE: This paper reviews the literature regarding the basic science and clinical efficacy of vapreotide in acute variceal bleeding.
METHODS: We used a PubMed/Medline search in order to review the literature regarding the drug, vapreotide.
RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Vapreotide appears to have benefit in the control of acute variceal bleeding.
It is easy to administer and has few side effects, which are minor.
These findings endorse the need for future trials to evaluate vapreotide and its use in acute variceal hemorrhage, a morbidity among patients with cirrhosis.
