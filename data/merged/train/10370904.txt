Multiple mechanisms of action: the pharmacological profile of budipine.
Four major components of the mechanism of action have been identified for the antiparkinsonian drug budipine up to now.
1) The primary action of budipine is an indirect dopaminergic effect as shown by facilitation of dopamine (DA) release, inhibition of monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) and of DA (re) up-take and stimulation of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), which in sum might be responsible for enhancing the endogenous dopaminergic activity.
2) Radioligand and functional studies at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type glutamate receptor characterize budipine as a low-affinity, uncompetitive antagonist with fast kinetics and moderate voltage-dependency at the phencyclidine (PCP) binding site, comparable to that observed with amantadine, thereby counteracting an increased excitatory glutamatergic activity.
3) The antimuscarinic action of budipine, verified by functional and binding studies at native muscarinic M1-M3 and human recombinant m1-m5 receptor subtypes in vitro, is up to 125-fold weaker than that of biperiden and corresponds to its approximately 100-fold lower potency to cause experimentally-induced peripheral antimuscarinic effects and explains only part of its high potency, which equals biperiden, to suppress cholinergically evoked tremor.
4) An additional inhibition of striatal gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release by budipine may be beneficial to suppress an increased striatal GABAergic output activity.
The contribution of other observed effects to the therapeutic action of budipine, i.e. weak stimulation of noradrenaline and serotonin release, binding to brain sigma1 receptors and blockade of histamine H1 receptors, is not yet clear.
By means of these multiple mechanisms, budipine might correct the imbalance of striatal output pathways by restoring DA levels in the striatum, and positively influence the secondary changes in other transmitter systems (glutamate, acetylcholine, GABA) observed in Parkinson's disease.
