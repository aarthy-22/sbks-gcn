Lanthanum (III) regulates the nitrogen assimilation in soybean seedlings under ultraviolet-B radiation.
Ultraviolet-B (UV-B, 280-320 nm) radiation has seriously affected the growth of plants.
Finding the technology/method to alleviate the damage of UV-B radiation has become a frontal topic in the field of environmental science.
The pretreatment with rare earth elements (REEs) is an effective method, but the regulation mechanism of REEs is unknown.
Here, the regulation effects of lanthanum (La(III)) on nitrogen assimilation in soybean seedlings (Glycine max L.) under ultraviolet-B radiation were investigated to elucidate the regulation mechanism of REEs on plants under UV-B radiation.
UV-B radiation led to the inhibition in the activities of the key enzymes (nitrate reductase, glutamine synthetase, glutamate synthase) in the nitrogen assimilation, the decrease in the contents of nitrate and soluble proteins, as well as the increase in the content of amino acid in soybean seedlings.
The change degree of UV-B radiation at the high level (0.45 W m(-2)) was higher than that of UV-B radiation at the low level (0.15 W m(-2)).
The pretreatment with 20 mg L(-1) La(III) could alleviate the effects of UV-B radiation on the activities of nitrate reductase, glutamine synthetase, glutamate synthase, and glutamate dehydrogenase, promoting amino acid conversion and protein synthesis in soybean seedlings.
The regulation effect of La(III) under UV-B radiation at the low level was better than that of UV-B radiation at the high level.
The results indicated that the pretreatment with 20 mg L(-1) La(III) could alleviate the inhibition of UV-B radiation on nitrogen assimilation in soybean seedlings.
