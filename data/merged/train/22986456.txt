Decreased serum chemerin levels in male Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes: sex dimorphism.
Chemerin, a recently discovered adipocytokine plays an important role in obesity and obesity-associated metabolic complications.
However, the role of chemerin in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has not fully been elucidated.
We compared the serum chemerin levels and metabolic parameters between 88 control subjects, 86 patients with metabolic syndrome (MS), and 147 patients with T2DM in a Japanese population and further analyzed their correlation.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the serum chemerin levels.
The chemerin levels were significantly higher in male than in female control subjects (p < 0.005), with significant decreases in patients with T2DM compared with those with MS and control subjects (164.9 ± 6.3 ng/mL vs. 209.8 ± 7.7 and 218.7 ± 7.3 ng/mL; p < 0.0001 vs. p < 0.0001, respectively) but no significant differences in female subjects.
The multiple regression analysis revealed that the chemerin levels negatively correlated with the fasting glucose and HbA1c levels in total and male subjects.
In the patients with T2DM, the chemerin levels negatively correlated with fasting glucose and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol but positively correlated with body mass index (BMI), and total cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
The negative correlation between the chemerin and fasting glucose levels remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI in the total and male subjects and those with T2DM.
These results suggest the role of chemerin in sex dimorphism and a potential link between chemerin levels and T2DM pathogenesis in a Japanese population.
