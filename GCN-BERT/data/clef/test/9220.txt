CLEANING COMPOSITION FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is in the field of detergents. In particular, it relates to a cleaning composition, more in particular to a composition comprising a cleaning amine. The composition provides good cleaning, in particular good grease cleaning. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Cooked-, baked- and burnt-on greasy soils are amongst the most severe types of soils to remove from surfaces. Traditionally, the removal of cooked-, baked- and burnt-on greasy soils from cookware and tableware requires soaking the soiled object prior to mechanical action. Manual dishwashing processes require a tremendous rubbing effort to remove cooked-, baked- and burnt- on greasy soils and this can be detrimental to the safety and condition of the cookware/tableware. Another problem faced in manual dishwashing is grease removal, in particular grease removal from hydrophobic substrates such as plastics. Users not only seek good cleaning but they also expect the washed items to be pleasant to the touch. Sometimes the washed items can have a greasy feeling during and or after rinse. One of the objectives of this invention is to provide a detergent good for grease cleaning, in particular on plastic items that leave the objects not only clean but also agreeable to the touch during and after the rinse. Hand dishwashing trends are changing. Traditionally, the washing up has been done in a sink full of water with the cleaning composition diluted in it. Nowadays, the trend is towards the use of a cleaning implement, such as a sponge. The cleaning composition is dosed onto the sponge, before or after the sponge is wetted, a soiled item is then wiped and subsequently rinsed under running water. This new way of hand dishwashing, sometimes referred to as direct application, places the cleaning composition in a new environment that needs to be taken into account for the design of the composition. With the new preference of using direct application, there is a need to provide a cleaning composition that performs well under the new usage conditions. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the first aspect of the invention, there is provided a cleaning composition, preferably in liquid form. The composition comprises a surfactant system and a cleaning amine. The composition provides excellent grease removal from all types of hard surfaces. Preferably the composition is a hand dishwashing composition. The surfactant system of the composition of the invention preferably comprises an anionic surfactant and a primary co-surfactant selected from the group consisting of amphoteric, zwitteronic and mixtures thereof. The composition can further comprise a non-ionic surfactant. The anionic surfactant can be any anionic cleaning surfactant, especially preferred anionic surfactants are selected from the group consisting of alkyl sulfate, alkyl alkoxy sufate, alkyl benzene sulfonate, paraffin sulfonate and mixtures thereof. Preferred anionic surfactants are selected from alkyl sulfate, alkyl alkoxy sulfate and mixtures thereof, a preferred alkyl alkoxy sulfate is alkyl ethoxy sulfate. Preferred anionic surfactant for use herein is a mixture of alkyl sulfate and alkyl ethoxy sulfate. Extremely useful surfactant systems for use herein include those comprising anionic surfactants, in combination with amine oxide, especially alkyl dimethyl amine oxides, and/or betaine surfactants. Another preferred surfactant system for use herein is an anionic and amphoteric/zwitterionic system in which the amphoteric to zwitterionic weight ratio is preferably from about 2: 1 to about 1 :2.. In particular a system in which the amphoteric surfactant is an amine oxide surfactant and the zwitteronic surfactant is a betaine and the weight ratio of the amine oxide to the betaine is about 1: 1. Also preferred for use herein are surfactant systems further comprising non-ionic surfactants. Especially preferred nonionic surfactants are alkyl alkoxylated nonionic surfactants, especially alkyl ethoxylated surfactants. Especially preferred surfactant systems for the composition of the invention comprise an anionic surfactant preferably selected from the group consisting of alkyl sulfate, alkyl alkoxy sulfate and mixtures thereof, more preferably an alkyl alkoxylated sulfate, and an amphoteric surfactant, preferably an amino oxide surfactant and a non-ionic surfactant. In summary, the most preferred surfactant system for use herein comprises an alkyl alkoxylated sulfate surfactant, amine oxide and non-ionic surfactant, especially an alkyl ethoxylated sulfate surfactant, alkyl dimethyl amine oxide and an alkyl ethoxylate nonionic surfactant. The composition of the invention can further comprise a salt of a divalent cation. In particular, a salt of magnesium. It has been found that magnesium cations can work in combination with the cleaning amine by strengthening and broadening the grease cleaning profile of the composition. The composition of the invention can further comprise a chelant. It has been found that chelants can act in combination with the cleaning amine of the invention to provide improved grease cleaning. Preferred chelants for use herein are aminophosphonate and aminocarboxylated chelants in particular aminocarboxylated chelants such as MGDA and GLDA. According to the second aspect of the invention there is provided a method of manually washing dishware using the composition of the invention in neat form (direct application). The composition of the invention can also be used in diluted form (full sink), however greater benefits in terms of grease cleaning are obtained when the composition is directly applied on the soiled surface or on a cleaning implement, such as sponge, to be used to clean the soiled surface. There is also provided the use of the composition of the invention for the removal of greasy soils in manual dishwashing. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention envisages a cleaning composition, preferably a hand dishwashing cleaning composition, comprising a surfactant system and a specific cleaning amine. The composition of the invention provides very good grease removal. The invention also envisages a method of hand dishwashing and use of the composition for the removal of greasy soils. The cleaning composition The cleaning composition is preferably a hand dishwashing cleaning composition, preferably in liquid form. It typically contains from 30% to 95%, preferably from 40% to 90%, more preferably from 50% to 85% by weight of a liquid carrier in which the other essential and optional components are dissolved, dispersed or suspended. One preferred component of the liquid carrier is water. Preferably the pH of the composition is from about 6 to about 12, more preferably from about 7 to about 11 and most preferably from about 8 to about 10, as measured at 25 °C and 10% aqueous concentration in distilled water. The cleaning amine of the invention performs better at a pH of from 8 to 10. The pH of the composition can be adjusted using pH modifying ingredients known in the art. Cleaning amine The composition of the invention includes from about 0.1% to about 10%, preferably, from about 0.2% to about 5%, and more preferably, from about 0.5% to about 4%, by weight of the composition, of the cleaning amine. By "cleaning amine" is herein meant a molecule, having the formula depicted herein below, comprising amine functionalities that helps cleaning as part of a cleaning composition. The cleaning amine of the invention has an ethylene diamine core with at least one primary amine functionality. The cleaning amine also comprises at least another nitrogen atom, preferable in the form of a tertiary amine functionality. Herein the term "core" refers to the alkyl chain between two nitrogen radicals. The number of carbons in the core does not include the radicals attached to the core. The cleaning amine has the formula: wherein: R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5 are independently selected from -H, linear, branched or cyclic alkyl or alkenyl having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms and n=0-3. Preferably, the cleaning amine is aliphatic in nature. The cleaning amine preferably has a molecular weight of less than about 1000 grams/mole and more preferably less than about 450 grams/mole. "n" varies from 0 to not more than 3, preferably "n" is 0. The amine molecule contains at least one primary amine functionality and preferably a tertiary amine functionality. For the purpose of this invention a "lower alkyl" is an alkyl comprising 1 or 2 carbon atoms. A "middle alkyl" is an alkyl comprising 3 carbon atoms. A "higher alkyl" is an alkyl comprising from 4 to 10 carbon atoms, preferably from 4 to 8 atoms, more preferably from 4 to 6 carbon atoms. Compositions comprising a cleaning amine in which R1 and R2 are both a lower alkyl provide very good cleaning of cooked-, baked- and burnt-on greasy soils. Compositions comprising a cleaning amine in which Rl and R2 are both a higher alkyl provide very good cleaning of uncooked grease and oil, even on plastic substrates. Compositions comprising a cleaning amine in which Rl and R2 are both a middle alkyl provide good cleaning across the whole spectrum, i.e., good cleaning of cooked-, baked- and burnt-on greasy soils and good cleaning of uncooked grease and oil. Equally, compositions in which the cleaning amine is a mixture of amines comprising an amine in which Rl and R2 are both a lower alkyl and an amine in which Rl and R2 are both a higher alkyl provide good cleaning across the whole spectrum, this also seems to be the case with a cleaning amine amine in which one of R1 and R2 is a lower alkyl and the other one is a higher alkyl. Especially suitable cleaning amines for use herein have been found to be amines wherein R1 and R2 are selected from isopropyl and butyl, preferably R1 and R2 are both isopropyl or both butyl. Preferred cleaning amines include those in which R1 and R2 are isopropyl and preferably, n is 0. Also preferred are amines in which R1 and R2 are butyl and preferably n is 0 R5 is preferably -CH3 or -CH2CH3. Cleaning amines in which R5 is -CH3 or-CH2CH3 could be good in terms of composition stability. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the methyl or ethyl radical can provide stearic hinderance that protects the cleaning amine from negative interaction with other components of the cleaning composition. This can be extremely advantageous in compositions comprising a preservative, in particular an isothiazolinone based preservative. The stability of this type of preservative could be affected by the cleaning amine and this might not be the case when R5 is methyl or ethyl. The term "cleaning amine" herein encompasses a single cleaning amine and a mixture thereof. The amine can be subjected to protonation depending on the pH of the cleaning medium in which it is used. Surfactant system The cleaning composition comprises from about 1% to about 60%, preferably from about 5% to about 50% more preferably from about 8% to about 40% by weight thereof of a surfactant system. The surfactant system preferably comprises an anionic surfactant, more preferably an anionic surfactant selected from the group consisting of alkyl sulfate, alkyl alkoxy surfate, especially alkyl ethoxy sulfate, alkyl benzene sulfonate, paraffin sulfonate and mixtures thereof. The system also comprises an amphoteric, and/or zwitterionic surfactant and optionally a non- ionic surfactant. Alkyl sulfates are preferred for use herein, especially alkyl ethoxy sulfates; more preferably a combination of alkyl sulfates and alkyl ethoxy sulfates with a combined average ethoxylation degree of less than 5, preferably less than 3, more preferably less than 2 and more than 0.5 and an average level of branching of from about 5% to about 40%. The composition of the invention preferably comprises an amphoteric and/or zwitterionic surfactant, preferably the amphoteric surfactant comprises an amine oxide, preferably an alkyl dimethyl amine oxide, and the zwitteronic surfactant comprises a betaine surfactant. The most preferred surfactant system for the detergent composition of the present invention comprise from 1% to 40%, preferably 6% to 35%, more preferably 8% to 30% weight of the total composition of an anionic surfactant, preferably an alkyl alkoxy sulfate surfactant, more preferably an alkyl ethoxy sulfate, combined with 0.5% to 15%, preferably from 1% to 12%, more preferably from 2% to 10% by weight of the composition of amphoteric and/or zwitterionic surfactant, more preferably an amphoteric and even more preferably an amine oxide surfactant, especially and alkyl dimethyl amine oxide. Preferably the composition further comprises a nonionic surfactant, especially an alcohol alkoxylate in particular and alcohol ethoxylate nonionic surfactant. It has been found that such surfactant system in combination with the amine of the invention provides excellent grease cleaning and good finish of the washed items. Anionic surfactant Anionic surfactants include, but are not limited to, those surface-active compounds that contain an organic hydrophobic group containing generally 8 to 22 carbon atoms or generally 8 to 18 carbon atoms in their molecular structure and at least one water-solubilizing group preferably selected from sulfonate, sulfate, and carboxylate so as to form a water-soluble compound.

In the weight average alkoxylation degree calculation the weight of sulfated anionic surfactant components not having alkoxylated groups should also be included. Weight average alkoxylation degree = (xl * alkoxylation degree of surfactant 1 + x2 * alkoxylation degree of surfactant 2 + ....) / (xl + x2 + ....) wherein xl, x2, ... are the weights in grams of each sulfated anionic surfactant of the mixture and alkoxylation degree is the number of alkoxy groups in each sulfated anionic surfactant.

The branched sulfated anionic surfactant can be a single anionic surfactant or a mixture of anionic surfactants. In the case of a single surfactant the percentage of branching refers to the weight percentage of the hydrocarbyl chains that are branched in the original alcohol from which the surfactant is derived. In the case of a surfactant mixture the percentage of branching is the weight average and it is defined according to the following formula: Weight average of branching (%)= [(xl * wt% branched alcohol 1 in alcohol 1 + x2 * wt% branched alcohol 2 in alcohol 2 + ....) / (xl + x2 + ....)] * 100 wherein xl, x2, ... are the weight in grams of each alcohol in the total alcohol mixture of the alcohols which were used as starting material for the anionic surfactant for the detergent of the invention.

As commonly understood in the detergent field, chelation herein means the binding or complexation of a bi- or multi-dentate ligand. These ligands, which are often organic compounds, are called chelants, chelators, chelating agents, and/or sequestering agent. Chelating agents form multiple bonds with a single metal ion. Chelants, are chemicals that form soluble, complex molecules with certain metal ions, inactivating the ions so that they cannot normally react with other elements or ions to produce precipitates or scale, or destabilizing soils facilitating their removal accordingly. The ligand forms a chelate complex with the substrate. The term is reserved for complexes in which the metal ion is bound to two or more atoms of the chelant.

Preferred salts of the abovementioned compounds are the ammonium and/or alkali metal salts, i.e. the lithium, sodium, and potassium salts, and particularly preferred salts are the sodium salts. Suitable polycarboxylic acids are acyclic, alicyclic, heterocyclic and aromatic carboxylic acids, in which case they contain at least two carboxyl groups which are in each case separated from one another by, preferably, no more than two carbon atoms. Polycarboxylates which comprise two carboxyl groups include, for example, water-soluble salts of, malonic acid, (ethylenedioxy) diacetic acid, maleic acid, diglycolic acid, tartaric acid, tartronic acid and fumaric acid. Polycarboxylates which contain three carboxyl groups include, for example, water-soluble citrate. Correspondingly, a suitable hydroxycarboxylic acid is, for example, citric acid. Another suitable polycarboxylic acid is the homopolymer of acrylic acid. Preferred are the polycarboxylates end capped with sulfonates. Amino phosphonates are also suitable for use as chelating agents and include ethylenediaminetetrakis (methylenephosphonates) as DEQUEST. Preferred are these amino phosphonates that do not contain alkyl or alkenyl groups with more than about 6 carbon atoms. Polyfunctionally-substituted aromatic chelating agents are also useful in the compositions herein such as described in U.S. Patent 3,812,044.

The most preferred chelants for use in the present invention are selected from the group consisting of diethylenetetraamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA), MGDA, GLDA, citrate and mixtures thereof. Preservatives The composition of the invention preferably comprises a preservative. A preservative is a naturally occurring or synthetically produced substance that is added to detergent compositions to prevent decomposition by microbial growth or by undesirable chemical changes. Preservatives can be divided into two types, depending on their origin. Class I preservatives refers to those preservatives which are naturally occurring, everyday substances. Class II preservatives refer to preservatives which are synthetically manufactured. Most preferred preservatives for use in liquid detergent compositions include derivatives of isothiazolinones, including methylisothiazolinone, methylchloroisothiazolinone, octylisothiazolinone, 1,2- benzisothiazolinone, and mixtures thereof. Other non-limiting examples of preservatives typically used are phenoxyethanol, paraben derivatives such as methyl paraben and propyl paraben, imidazole derivatives, and aldehydes including glutaraldehyde. The detergent composition herein may comprise a number of optional ingredients such as builders, conditioning polymers, cleaning polymers, surface modifying polymers, soil flocculating polymers, structurants, emollients, humectants, skin rejuvenating actives, enzymes, carboxylic acids, scrubbing particles, bleach and bleach activators, perfumes, malodor control agents, pigments, dyes, opacifiers, beads, pearlescent particles, microcapsules, antibacterial agents, enzymes, pH adjusters, buffering means or water or any other dilutents or solvents compatible with the formulation. Method of washing The second aspect of the invention is directed to a method of washing dishware with the composition of the present invention. Said method comprises the step of applying the composition, preferably in liquid form, onto the dishware surface, either directly or by means of a cleaning implement, i.e., in neat form. By "in its neat form", it is meant herein that said composition is not diluted in a full sink of water. The composition is applied directly onto the surface to be treated and/or onto a cleaning device or implement such as a dish cloth, a sponge or a dish brush without undergoing major dilution (immediately) prior to the application. The cleaning device or implement is preferably wet before or after the composition is delivered to it. Especially good polymerized grease removal has been found when the composition is used in neat form. The cleaning mechanism that takes place when compositions are used in neat form seems to be quite different to that taken place when compositions are used in diluted form. Examples The removal of uncooked grease of hand dishwashing detergent compositions with and without amines according to the invention was evaluated. As it can be seen from the results below, compositions comprising the amines of the invention provide considerably greater grease removal than the same compositions without the amine. EXAMPLE 1 The following hand dishwashing detergent compositions were made: AES: Alkyl ethoxy sulfate PPG 2000: polypropylene glycol (Molecular Weight 2000) Methodology Grease (beef fat) is liquefied by heating and small amounts are put in small glass vials and left at 4°C for at least 24 hours. The day before the test, the vials with the grease are put at 21°C to equilibrate. 5% wash solutions (water hardness: 14dH) of the hand dishwashing detergent compositions as shown in Table 1 are added to the vial containing the grease. Turbidity / absorbance of the wash solutions is measured over time at 25°C, under mild stirring conditions via a small overhead stirrer. Cleaning indexes are calculated with reference to the composition free of amine (Composition A): (Absorbance of the test solution with amine / absorbance of the reference solution without amine) * 100. The higher the absorbance and Cleaning Index, the better the grease cleaning performance of the composition. Absorbances and Cleaning Indices after 2 / 5 / 15 / 20 CM4080QL-GL As it can be seen, the composition of the invention (Composition B) performs better than the same composition without the amine (Composition A). EXAMPLE 2 The following hand dishwashing detergent compositions were made: Table 2 PEI polymer: alkoxylated polyethyleneimine polymer Methodology Grease (beef fat) is liquefied by heating and polystyrene sticks coated with paraffin wax are dipped in the liquid grease, so that grease-covered sticks are obtained. The grease-covered sticks are stored at 4C for minimum 24 hours. For measuring the grease cleaning performance of the compositions, the grease-covered sticks are placed over a slightly moving swirling microplate containing 10% wash solutions of the compositions (water hardness: 14dH). The grease-covered sticks are dipping into the test solutions without getting in contact with the walls or bottom of the microplate and are kepi in the swirling test solutions during the wash time. The wash temperature is 30°C. The turbidity of the test solutions is quantified via measuring the absorbance of the test solutions and from the measured absorbance the cleaning index is calculated: ( Absorbance of the test solution with amine / absorbance of the reference solution without amine) * 100. The higher the Cleaning index, the better the grease cleaning performance of the composition. As it can he seen, the composition of the invention (Composition D) performs better than the same composition without the amine (Composition C).
