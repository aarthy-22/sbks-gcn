SUBSTITUTED INDOLE MCL-1 INHIBITORS CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims benefit of and priority to United States Provisional Application Serial Number 61/971,023, filed March 27, 2014, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] The present invention pertains to compounds that inhibit the activity of an anti- apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Myeloid cell leukemia- 1 (Mcl-1) protein, compositions containing the compounds, and methods of treating cancer involving over-expressed or dysregulated Mcl-1 protein. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] Abnormal regulation of apoptosis is now recognized to play an important role in the development of cancer. The apoptosis pathway can be initiated by various extracellular and intracellular stresses, including growth factor deprivation, DNA damage, oncogene induction, and cytotoxic drugs (Danial, N. N. and Korsmeyer, SJ. Cell (2004) 1 16, 205-219). The death signal leads to the oligomerization of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak. Upon activation, they permeabilize the mitochondrial outer membrane and release apoptogenic factors into the cytoplasm. This process is tightly regulated by both pro-apoptotic (Bax, Bak, Bad, Bid, Bim, Bmf, NOXA, PUMA) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Bcl2-Al, Mcl-1) members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. Recent data suggests that the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins function to protect the cell from apoptotic insults, primarily by preventing disruption of mitochondrial outer membrane integrity by binding to the pro-apoptotic proteins as described in Adams, J. M. and Cory S. Oncogene (2007) 26, 1324-1337; Willis, S. N. et al. Science (2007) 315,856-859. Because tumor cells are under stress, alterations in their apoptotic signaling pathways are believed to be crucial for survival. Recent data implicates down-regulated apoptosis in the onset of cancer. Research has shown, for example, that anti- apoptotic proteins, are over-expressed in many cancer cell types as described in Beroukhim, R. et al. Nature (2010) 463, 899-905; Zhang J. Y., Nature Reviews Drug Discovery, (2002) 1, 101 ; Kirkin, V. et al. Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (2004) 1644, 229-249; and Amundson, S.A. et al. Cancer Research (2000) 60, 6101-61 10. This dysregulation results in the survival of cells that would otherwise have undergone apoptosis such as cancer cells. This suggests that neutralizing the function of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins may offer an effective strategy for the elimination of cancer cells. In addition, resistance to chemotherapy which is a major cause of treatment failure and poor prognosis in many cancers can be caused by the upregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. [0004] An important anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family is Myeloid cell leukemia- 1 (Mcl-1). Mcl-1 is one of the most frequently amplified anti-apoptotic genes in human cancers including prostate, lung, pancreatic, breast, ovarian, and cervical cancers, as well as melanoma, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (Beroukhim et al. Nature (2010) 463, 899-905). Moreover, its overexpression is implicated as a resistance factor for multiple therapies including widely prescribed microtubule-targeted agents for breast cancers, such as paclitaxel and vincristine as well as Gemcitabine, a first-line treatment option for pancreatic cancer (Wei et al. Cancer Chemother Pharmacol (2008) 62, 1055-1064 and Wertz et al. Nature (201 1) 471 , 1 10-114). These data suggest that Mcl-1 is an important target for a wide variety of cancers. [0005] In many cancer cell types, the cancer cell's survival is attributed to the dysregulation of the apoptotic pathway caused by the over-expression of one or more anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein family members. Because of the important role for Bcl-2 family of proteins in regulating apoptosis in both cancerous and non-cancerous cells, and the inter-cell variability of Bcl-2 family protein expression, it could be advantageous to have a small molecule inhibitor that selectively targets and preferably binds to one type or a subset of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein(s). A selective compound also may confer certain advantages in the clinical setting, by providing flexibility to select a dosing regimen to reduce on-target toxic effects in normal cells. [0006] Because Mcl-1 protein is an important Bcl-2 family member associated with a number of diseases, there is a need for compounds which bind to and inhibit the activity of Mcl-1 protein.

Heteroaryl groups include, without limitation, thienyl, furanyl, pyrrolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, oxadiazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, thiadiazolyl, pyridyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, indolizinyl, purinyl, naphthyridinyl, and pteridinyl. The terms "heteroaryl" and "heteroar-", as used herein, also include groups in which a heteroaromatic ring is fused to one or more aryl, cycloaliphatic, or heterocyclyl rings, where the radical or point of attachment is on the heteroaromatic ring. Non-limiting examples include indolyl, isoindolyl, benzothienyl, benzofuranyl, dibenzofuranyl, indazolyl, benzimidazolyl, benzthiazolyl, quinolyl, isoquinolyl, cinnolinyl, phthalazinyl, quinazolinyl, quinoxalinyl, 4H-quinolizinyl, carbazolyl, acridinyl, phenazinyl, phenothiazinyl, phenoxazinyl, tetrahydroquinolinyl, tetrahydroisoquinolinyl, and pyrido[2,3-b]-l,4-oxazin-3(4H)-one. A heteroaryl group may be mono- or bicyclic. The term "heteroaryl" may be used interchangeably with the terms "heteroaryl ring," "heteroaryl group," or "heteroaromatic," any of which terms include rings that are optionally substituted. The term "heteroaralkyl" refers to an alkyl group substituted by a heteroaryl, wherein the alkyl and heteroaryl portions independently are optionally substituted. [0029] As used herein, the terms "heterocycle," "heterocyclyl," "heterocyclic radical," and "heterocyclic ring" are used interchangeably and refer to a stable 5- to 7-membered monocyclic or 7-10-membered bicyclic heterocyclic moiety that is either saturated or partially unsaturated, and having, in addition to carbon atoms, one or more, preferably one to four, heteroatoms. When used in reference to a ring atom of a heterocycle, the term "nitrogen" includes a substituted nitrogen. As an example, in a saturated or partially unsaturated ring having 1-3 heteroatoms selected from oxygen, sulfur or nitrogen, the nitrogen may be N (as in 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrolyl), NH (as in pyrrolidinyl), or +NR (as in N-substituted pyrrolidinyl). [0030] A heterocyclic ring can be attached to its pendant group at any heteroatom or carbon atom that results in a stable structure and any of the ring atoms can be optionally substituted. Examples of such saturated or partially unsaturated heterocyclic radicals include, without limitation, tetrahydrofuranyl, tetrahydrothiophenyl pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, pyrrolinyl, tetrahydroquinolinyl, tetrahydroisoquinolinyl, decahydroquinolinyl, oxazolidinyl, piperazinyl, dioxanyl, dioxolanyl, diazepinyl, oxazepinyl, thiazepinyl, morpholinyl, and quinuclidinyl.

A heterocyclyl group may be mono- or bicyclic. The term "heterocyclylalkyl" refers to an alkyl group substituted by a heterocyclyl, wherein the alkyl and heterocyclyl portions independently are optionally substituted. [0031] As used herein, the term "partially unsaturated" refers to a ring moiety that includes at least one double or triple bond. The term "partially unsaturated" is intended to encompass rings having multiple sites of unsaturation, but is not intended to include aryl or heteroaryl moieties, as herein defined. [0032] As described herein, compounds of the invention may contain "optionally substituted" moieties. In general, the term "substituted," whether preceded by the term "optionally" or not, means that one or more hydrogens of the designated moiety are replaced with a suitable substituent. Unless otherwise indicated, an "optionally substituted" group may have a suitable substituent at each substitutable position of the group, and when more than one position in any given structure may be substituted with more than one substituent selected from a specified group, the substituent may be either the same or different at every position. Combinations of substituents envisioned by this invention are preferably those that result in the formation of stable or chemically feasible compounds. The term "stable," as used herein, refers to compounds that are not substantially altered when subjected to conditions to allow for their production, detection, and, in certain embodiments, their recovery, purification, and use for one or more of the purposes disclosed herein.

[00340] In certain embodiments, compounds of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition thereof, are administered in combination with a monoclonal antibody or an siRNA therapeutic. [00341] Those additional agents are optionally administered separately from an inventive compound-containing composition, as part of a multiple dosage regimen. Alternatively, those agents are optionally part of a single dosage form, mixed together with a compound of this invention in a single composition. If administered as part of a multiple dosage regime, the two active agents are submitted simultaneously, sequentially or within a period of time from one another normally within five hours from one another. [00342] As used herein, the term "combination," "combined," and related terms refers to the simultaneous or sequential administration of therapeutic agents in accordance with this invention. For example, a compound of the present invention is administered with another therapeutic agent simultaneously or sequentially in separate unit dosage forms or together in a single unit dosage form. Accordingly, the present invention provides a single unit dosage form comprising a provided compound, an additional therapeutic agent, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle. [00343] The amount of both, an inventive compound and additional therapeutic agent (in those compositions which comprise an additional therapeutic agent as described above)) that is combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. Preferably, compositions of this invention should be formulated so that a dosage of between 0.01 - 100 mg/kg body weight/day of an inventive can be administered. [00344] In those compositions which comprise an additional therapeutic agent, that additional therapeutic agent and the compound of this invention act synergistically. Therefore, the amount of additional therapeutic agent in such compositions will be less than that required in a monotherapy utilizing only that therapeutic agent. In such compositions a dosage of between 0.01 - 1,000 μg/kg body weight/day of the additional therapeutic agent can be administered. [00345] The amount of additional therapeutic agent present in the compositions of this invention will be no more than the amount that would normally be administered in a composition comprising that therapeutic agent as the only active agent. Preferably the amount of additional therapeutic agent in the presently disclosed compositions will range from about 50% to 100% of the amount normally present in a composition comprising that agent as the only therapeutically active agent. [00346] The compounds of this invention, or pharmaceutical compositions thereof, are optionally incorporated into compositions for coating an implantable medical device, such as prostheses, artificial valves, vascular grafts, stents and catheters. Vascular stents, for example, have been used to overcome restenosis (re-narrowing of the vessel wall after injury). However, patients using stents or other implantable devices risk clot formation or platelet activation. These unwanted effects are prevented or mitigated by pre-coating the device with a pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a kinase inhibitor. Implantable devices coated with a compound of this invention are another embodiment of the present invention.

A synergistic effect can be attained when the active ingredients are: (1) co-formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined, unit dosage formulation; (2) delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations; or (3) by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy, a synergistic effect can be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially, e.g., by different injections in separate syringes, separate pills or capsules, or in separate infusions. In general, during alternation therapy, an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially, i.e., serially, whereas in combination therapy, effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together. [00386] The compounds of formula I, II, III, IV, V, VI, or VII can be administered for any of the uses described herein by any suitable means, for example, orally, such as in the form of tablets, capsules, granules or powders; sublingually; bucally; parenterally, such as by subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, or intrasternal injection, or infusion techniques (e.g., as sterile injectable aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or suspensions); nasally, including administration to the nasal membranes, such as by inhalation spray; topically, such as in the form of a cream or ointment; or rectally such as in the form of suppositories; in dosage unit formulations containing non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles or diluents. [00387] In carrying out the method of the invention for treating cancers and related diseases, a pharmaceutical composition will be employed containing the compounds of formula I, II, III, IV, V, VI, or VII, with or without other anticancer agent(s) and/or other type therapeutic agents in association with a pharmaceutical vehicle or diluent. The pharmaceutical composition can be formulated employing conventional solid or liquid vehicles or diluents and pharmaceutical additives of a type appropriate to the mode of desired administration, such as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, binders, and the like. The compounds can be administered to a mammalian patient, including humans, monkeys, dogs, etc. by an oral route, for example, in the form of tablets, capsules, beads, granules or powders. The dose for adults is preferably between 1 and 2,000 mg per day, which can be administered in a single dose or in the form of individual doses from 1-4 times per day. [00388] A typical capsule for oral administration contains compounds of formula I, II, III, IV, V, VI, or VII (250 mg), lactose (75 mg), and magnesium stearate (15 mg). The mixture is passed through a 60 mesh sieve and packed into a No. 1 gelatin capsule. [00389] A typical injectable preparation is produced by aseptically placing 250 mg of a compound of formula I, II, III, IV, V, VI, or VII into a vial, aseptically freeze-drying and sealing. For use, the contents of the vial are mixed with 2 mL of physiological saline, to produce an injectable preparation.

Compounds of Formula 28 can be employed to subsequent reactions as depicted in above Schemes. Scheme 7 33 37 [00398] An alternate route to substituted tricyclic indole amides is shown in Scheme 7 and described here. The tricyclic amide intermediates of Formula 30 can be prepared by alkylation of the indole NH of ester 14 with optionally substituted cyclic sulfamidates 29 followed by cyclization upon removal of the Boc-protecting group (see, for example, Richter H. G. F. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2010, 5713). The size and stereochemistry of the newly formed cyclic amide can be controlled by size and preset stereo-configuration of the reagent 29. The NH group of Formula 30 can undergo alkylation reactions with compounds of Formula 31, wherein X is CI, Br, I, OMs, or OTs with a base such as NaH, K2CO3, CS2CO3, Et3N, or DIPEA in a suitable solvent such as DMF, THF, ether, DME, or the like, to give compounds of Formula 28. Corresponding compounds of Formulae 32 and 33 can be prepared from the ester 28 by saponification and coupling of sulfonamides to the carboxylic acid functional group of compounds 32 as described in Scheme 5. Alternatively, a variety of aryl or heteroaryl halides of Formula 34, wherein X is Br, I, or OTf can be coupled to the NH group of Formula 30 in the presence of a catalytic Pd species, such as Pd(OAc)2, Pd2(dba)3 and a suitable ligand such as Xantphos and a base such as Na2C03, CS2CO3, or K2C03 to generate compounds of Formula 35.

The assay was run using either a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled BH3 peptide derived from Bak (FITC-AHx- GQVGRQLAIIGDDINR-NH2) or a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled BH3 peptide derived from Bim (FITC-AHx- EARIAQELRRIGDEFNETYTR -NH2) that were purchased from GenScript (Piscataway, NJ) at >95% purity and used without further purification. 10 nM FITC-Bak peptide and 15 nM recombinant Mcl-1 (residues 172-327) were added to assay buffer (3 mM dithiothreitol, 50 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5). The Bim based assay was run with 1 nM FITC-Bim peptide and 1.5 nM recombinant Mcl-1 (residues 172-327) added to assay buffer (20 mM TRIS pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 3 mM DTT, 0.01% CHAPS). For selectivity assays, 40 nM Bcl-2 (residues i_207A96T'G110R, Δ35-91, replaced with Bcl-xL35-5o) or 4 nM Bcl-xL (residues 1-209, loop 45-86 deleted) were incubated with 10 nM FITC-Bak in assay buffer. [00912] Compounds are diluted in DMSO in a 10-point, 3-fold serial dilution scheme. For the FITC -BAK assay 2.5 uL compound is added to 47.5 of assay buffer containing FITC-Bak and protein, for a final DMSO concentration of 5% and a top concentration of 20 μΜ. A FITC-Bak peptide alone (100% inhibition) and peptide plus protein (0 % inhibition) control is included on each assay plate. For the FITC -Bim assay, compound is added to 40 uL of assay buffer containing protein, 15 minutes prior to addition of 10 μϊ^ of the FITC-Bim peptide, for a final DMSO concentration of 0.165% and a top concentration of 200 nM. A FITC-Bim peptide alone (100 % inhibition) and peptide plus protein (0 % inhibition) control is included on each assay plate. The plate was mixed and incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature. Anisotropy is measured at excitation wavelength 480 nm and emission wavelength 535 nm using an EnVision Multi-label plate reader (PerkinElmer, Wellesley, MA, USA) or a BioTek Cytation 3 (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). Fluorescence anisotropy is plotted against compound concentration to generate an IC50 (inhibitor concentration at which 50% of bound peptide is displaced) by fitting the data to a 4-parameter logistic model using XLFit software (Guildford, Surrey, UK). IC50 is converted to a binding dissociation constant (¾ value) according to the formula of Wang Z. FEBS Lett (1996) 3, 245. ^ pwaLWKd + pvKd + i) where [I] 50 is the concentration of the free inhibitor at 50% inhibition, [L]so is the concentration of the free labeled ligand at 50% inhibition, [P]o is the concentration of the free protein at 0% inhibition, ¾ represents the dissociation constant of the FITC peptide probe. The results for representative compounds are shown in Table 2 and 3.

Cellular Viability of Human Tumor Cell Lines [00916] Human cancer cell lines ALMC-1, ALMC-2, K562, H929, and OPM-2 were cultured in media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). To evaluate compound effect on cellular proliferation, cells were plated at 1,000 cells/well in 96-well tissue culture plates in a total volume of 90 medium supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO). 24 hours later, 10 of compound (in a 2-fold serial dilution) is added to the cells for a top concentration of 50 μΜ and a final DMSO concentration < 1%. After 72 hours, 50 μϊ^ of Cell TiterGlo (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA ) reagent is added to each well and plates are incubated at room temperature, in the dark, for 30 minutes. Luminescence is measured on a BioTek Cytation 3. Luminescence values are imported into a template in XLFit (Guildford, Surrey, UK) that uses a four-parameter fit to generate an IC50 value for each compound dilution series on the plate. [00917] Table 4. IC50 (in μΜ) for representative compounds on cellular proliferation of human cancer cell lines Apoptosis Assay protocol (Caspase 3/7 Glo) [00918] Induction of apoptosis was measured by quantifying caspase 3/7 activity using the commercially available Caspase-Glo reagent (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA). This assay relies on the cleavage of a proluminescent substrate by activated caspases, which is then detected on the BioTek Cytation 3. 5000 cells in 90 of media (+ 5% FBS) are plated in each well of a white 96-well plate and incubated overnight at 37°C in a tissue culture incubator. The following day, compound is diluted in a 10-pt, 2-fold serial dilution scheme for a final top concentration of 50 μΜ. 10 μί of compound is added directly to the cell assay plate for a final volume of 100 μ Columns 1 1 and 12 are reserved for treatment with DMSO to serve as control wells. Plates are incubated for 3 hours. 100 i of Caspase-Glo reagent is added to each well and plates are incubated at room temperature, in the dark, for 30 minutes. Luminescence is measured on the Cytation 3. Luminescence values are imported into a template in XLFit (Guildford, Surrey, UK) that uses a four-parameter fit to generate an IC50 value for each compound dilution series on the plate.
