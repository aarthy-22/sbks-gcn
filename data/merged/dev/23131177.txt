Characterization of substituted phenylpropylamides as highly selective agonists at the melatonin MT2 receptor.
Melatonin is a widely distributed hormone that regulates several major physiological processes, including the circadian rhythm and seasonal adaptation.
The two subtypes of mammalian G protein-coupled melatonin receptors are primarily responsible for mediating the actions of melatonin.
Because synthetic melatonin agonists have considerable therapeutic potentials in modulating insomnia and circadian- related sleep disorders, it is highly desirable to develop subtype-selective melatoninergic compounds.
The pharmacological potencies of a series of substituted N-[3-(3-methoxyphenyl)propyl] amides towards human melatonin MT(1) and MT(2) receptors were evaluated by the FLIPR high-throughput screening assay, whilst their subtype-selectivity was subsequently verified with ERK phosphorylation and cAMP assays.
Structure-activity relationship analysis of highly potent subtype-selective ligands (MT(2) EC(50) 10-90 pM) revealed that a benzyloxyl substituent incorporated at C6 position of the 3-methoxyphenyl ring dramatically enhanced the MT(2) potency and at the same time decreased MT(1) potency.
Incorporation of structural moieties conferring the subtype selectivity produced several extremely potent MT(2)-selective ligands.
The most potent subtype-selective ligand, 2q had a substantially higher potency for MT(2) receptor than melatonin for elevation of [Ca(2+)]i and inhibition of forskolin-elevated cAMP.
Representative MT(2)-selective ligands also induced ERK phosphorylation in both recombinant and native cell lines, and no cross-reactivity to 17 other GPCRs could be detected.
These ligands represent invaluable tools for delineating the functional roles of distinct melatonin receptor subtypes and are viable candidates for drug development.
