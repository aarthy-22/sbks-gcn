Neuroprotective Effects of Cilostazol on Retinal Ganglion Cell damage in Diabetic Rats.
Neurodegeneration is an important component of diabetic retinopathy with increasing evidence that retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death occurs early in diabetes.
We investigated the effects of cilostazol, which has been widely used to manage diabetic complications, on retinal ganglion cell death in diabetic retina.
Four-week-old Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats and Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats as matched nondiabetic controls were treated with daily oral cilostazol at 30mg/kg or 0.9 % saline solution.
In OLETF rats at the age of 40 weeks, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunofluorescence staining was upregulated in vertical sections and showed a more ramified pattern in whole-mount retinas compared with that in LETO rats.
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression was limited to the ganglion cell layer in LETO rats, but extended into the outer plexiform layer in OLETF rats.
Immunofluorescence staining and western blotting demonstrated that cilostazol treatment reduced GFAP and VEGF expression in the retinas of OLETF rats.
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNLEL) staining revealed an increase in the RGC layer in OLETF compared with LETO rats (P<0.05), and cilostazol treatment reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells in OLETF rats (P<0.05).
Relieving retinal ischemia by systemic cilostazol treatment had a noticeable protective effect on RGCs in diabetic rats.
Cilostazol treatment may be useful for the management of diabetic retinal vascular dysfunction and neuronal degeneration.
