Induction of apoptosis in human ovarian cancer cells by new anticancer compounds, epothilone A and B. Epothilones are a new group of compounds with action mechanisms similar to taxanes.
The aim of this study was to compare the effects of epothilone A (Epo A) and epothilone B (Epo B) on ovarian cancer cell line SKOV-3 with those of paclitaxel (PTX), a classic taxane.
We evaluate glycoprotein P (P-gp) activity in the ovarian cancer cell line.
Apoptotic and necrotic cell levels were measured by double staining with Hoechst 33258 and propidium iodide (PI) as well as Annexin V staining.
The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) in cells exposed to Epo A, Epo B and PTX were studied using specific fluorescence probes, DCFH(2)-DA (2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate) and JC-1 (5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolcarbocyanine).
The cytotoxic activity of the drugs was determined by the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide) test.
All probes were analyzed in both the presence and absence of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC).
The results obtained demonstrated that the antiproliferative capacity of Epo A and Epo B in SKOV-3 cell line (measured as IC(50) after 72 h continuous treatment) was six and five times greater than that of PTX's respectively.
Epothilones induced timecourse-dependent apoptosis and necrosis.
Apoptotic and necrotic events were partially blocked by NAC, indicating ROS played a substantial role in epothilone-induced apoptosis.
Cell death was also associated with a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, which was more pronounced after treatment with epothilones as compared to paclitaxel.
