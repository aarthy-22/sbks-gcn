Significance of reductive metabolism in human intestine and quantitative prediction of intestinal first-pass metabolism by cytosolic reductive enzymes.
The number of new drug candidates that are cleared via non-cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes has increased.
However, unlike oxidation by P450, the roles of reductive enzymes are less understood.
The metabolism in intestine is especially not well known.
The purposes of this study were to investigate the significance of reductive metabolism in human intestine, and to establish a quantitative prediction method of intestinal first-pass metabolism by cytosolic reductive enzymes, using haloperidol, mebendazole, and ziprasidone.
First, we estimated the metabolic activities for these compounds in intestine and liver using subcellular fractions.
Metabolic activities were detected in human intestinal cytosol (HIC) for all three compounds, and the intrinsic clearance values were higher than those in human liver cytosol for haloperidol and mebendazole.
These metabolic activities in HIC were NADPH- and/or NADH-dependent.
Furthermore, the metabolic activities for all three compounds in HIC were largely inhibited by menadione, which has been used as a carbonyl reductase (CBR)-selective chemical inhibitor.
Therefore, considering subcellular location, cofactor requirement, and chemical inhibition, these compounds might be metabolized by CBRs in human intestine.
Subsequently, we tried to quantitatively predict intestinal availability (Fg) for these compounds using human intestinal S9 (HIS9).
Our prediction model using apparent permeability of parallel artificial membrane permeability assay and metabolic activities in HIS9 could predict Fg in humans for the three compounds well.
In conclusion, CBRs might have higher metabolic activities in human intestine than in human liver.
Furthermore, our prediction method of human Fg using HIS9 is applicable to substrates of cytosolic reductive enzymes.
