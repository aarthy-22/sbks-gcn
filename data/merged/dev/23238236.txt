Chemical assessment and antioxidant capacity of pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) seeds.
Capsicum annuum L. is reported to be the most widely cultivated species.
Recently, waste of vegetable processing, like seeds, has been the subject of many studies as an attempt to find new, alternative and cheap resources of bioactive compounds with application in several industries.
Despite their chemical, biological and ecological importance, C. annuum seeds are still poorly studied.
To improve the knowledge on the metabolic profile of this matrix, a targeted metabolite analysis was performed in "sweet Italian" and "Reus long pairal" pepper seeds.
Sterols, triterpenes, organic acids, fatty acids and volatile compounds were determined by different chromatographic methods.
The antioxidant activity was assessed against DPPH(·), superoxide and nitric oxide radicals.
A concentration-dependent activity was noticed against all radicals.
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitory capacity was also evaluated, but no effect was found.
Data provide evidence of great similarities between "sweet Italian" and "Reus long pairal" pepper seeds.
The present study indicates that C. annuum seeds are a potential source of valuable bioactive compounds that could be used in food industry.
