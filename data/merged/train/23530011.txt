Metabolic Effects of Chronic Cannabis Smoking.
OBJECTIVEWe examined if chronic cannabis smoking is associated with hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, reduced β-cell function, or dyslipidemia in healthy individuals.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSIn a cross-sectional, case-control study, we studied cannabis smokers (n = 30; women, 12; men, 18; 27 ± 8 years) and control subjects (n = 30) matched for age, sex, ethnicity, and BMI (27 ± 6).
Abdominal fat depots and intrahepatic fat content were quantified by magnetic resonance imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively.
Insulin-sensitivity indices and various aspects of β-cell function were derived from oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT).RESULTSSelf-reported cannabis use was: 9.5 (2-38) years; joints/day: 6 (3-30) [median (range)].
Carbohydrate intake and percent calories from carbohydrates, but not total energy intake, were significantly higher in cannabis smokers.
There were no group differences in percent total body fat, or hepatic fat, but cannabis smokers had a higher percent abdominal visceral fat (18 ± 9 vs. 12 ± 5%; P = 0.004).
Cannabis smokers had lower plasma HDL cholesterol (49 ± 14 vs. 55 ± 13 mg/dL; P = 0.02), but fasting levels of glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, or free fatty acids (FFA) were not different.
Adipocyte insulin resistance index and percent FFA suppression during an OGTT was lower (P < 0.05) in cannabis smokers.
However, oral glucose insulin sensitivity index, measures of β-cell function, or incretin concentrations did not differ between the groups.
CONCLUSIONSChronic cannabis smoking was associated with visceral adiposity and adipose tissue insulin resistance but not with hepatic steatosis, insulin insensitivity, impaired pancreatic β-cell function, or glucose intolerance.
