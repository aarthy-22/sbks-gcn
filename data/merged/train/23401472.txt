Epigenetic Regulation Is a Crucial Factor in the Repression of UGT1A1 Expression in the Human Kidney.
Human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 catalyzes the metabolism of numerous clinically and pharmacologically important compounds such as bilirubin and SN-38.
UGT1A1 is predominantly expressed in the liver and intestine, but not in the kidney.
The purpose of this study was to uncover the mechanism of the tissue-specific expression of UGT1A1, focusing on its epigenetic regulation.
Bisulfite sequence analysis revealed that the CpG-rich region near the UGT1A1 promoter (-85 to +40) was hypermethylated (83%) in the kidney, whereas it was hypomethylated (37%) in the liver.
A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that histone H3 near the promoter was hypoacetylated in the kidney but was hyperacetylated in the liver; this hyperacetylation was accompanied by the recruitment of HNF1α to the promoter.
The UGT1A1 promoter in human kidney-derived HK-2 cells that do not express UGT1A1 was fully methylated, but was relatively unmethylated in human liver-derived HuH-7 cells that express UGT1A1.
Treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC), an inhibitor of DNA methylation, resulted in an increase of UGT1A1 mRNA expression in both cell types, but the increase was much larger in HK-2 cells than in HuH-7 cells.
The transfection of an HNF1α expression plasmid into the HK-2 cells resulted in an increase of UGT1A1 mRNA only in the presence of 5-Aza-dC. In summary, we found that DNA hypermethylation along with histone hypoacetylation interferes with the binding of HNF1α, resulting in the defective expression of UGT1A1 in the human kidney.
Thus, epigenetic regulation is a crucial determinant of tissue-specific expression of UGT1A1.
