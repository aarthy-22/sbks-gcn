Glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-2 reduces chemotherapy-associated mortality and enhances cell survival in cells expressing a transfected GLP-2 receptor.
Chemotherapeutic agents produce cytotoxicity via induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.
Rapidly proliferating cells in the bone marrow and intestinal crypts are highly susceptible to chemotherapy, and damage to these cellular compartments may preclude maximally effective chemotherapy administration.
Glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-2 is an enteroendocrine-derived regulatory peptide that inhibits crypt cell apoptosis after administration of agents that damage the intestinal epithelium.
We report here that a human degradation-resistant GLP-2 analogue, h[Gly2]-GLP-2 significantly improves survival, reduces bacteremia, attenuates epithelial injury, and inhibits crypt apoptosis in the murine gastrointestinal tract after administration of topoisomerase I inhibitor irinotecan hydrochloride or the antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil.
h[Gly2]-GLP-2 significantly improved survival and reduced weight loss but did not impair chemotherapy effectiveness in tumor-bearing mice treated with cyclical irinotecan.
Furthermore, h[Gly2]-GLP-2 reduced chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, decreased activation of caspase-8 and -3, and inhibited poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage in heterologous cells transfected with the GLP-2 receptor.
These observations demonstrate that the antiapoptotic effects of GLP-2 on intestinal crypt cells may be useful for the attenuation of chemotherapy-induced intestinal mucositis.
