Effect of ketotifen on acute gastric lesions and gastric secretion in rats.
Ketotifen, a histamine H1-receptor antagonist and mast cell stabilizer, significantly protected the rat gastric mucosa against lesions induced by necrotizing agents, histamine or compound 48/80.
The agent significantly inhibited the basal gastric acid secretion, but had little or no effect on the histamine-stimulated secretion.
The mucosal protective effect was observed even at a dose that had little or no effect on gastric acid secretion, suggesting that ketotifen exhibits so-called cytoprotective activity.
