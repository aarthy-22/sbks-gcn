SPECIFICATION NOVELATP:CITRATE LYASE GENES TECHNICAL FIELD [0001 ] The present invention relates to novel genes for ATP:citrate lyase. BACKGROUND ART [0002] Fatty acids are important components of lipids such as phospholipids and triacylglycerols. Fatty acids containing two or more unsaturated bonds are collectively referred to as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and are known to include arachidonic acid, dihomo-y-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. Various physiological activities have been reported for these fatty acids (Non-patent Document 1). These polyunsaturated fatty acids are expected to have applications in various fields, but some of them cannot be synthesized in the animal body. Thus, microbial techniques have been developed for obtaining polyunsaturated fatty acids by culturing various microorganisms. Other attempts have also been made to produce polyunsaturated fatty acids in plants. In these cases, polyunsaturated fatty acids are known to be accumulated, for example, as components of lipids such as triacylglycerols within microorganism cells or plant seeds. [0003] Such novel fatty acid synthesis in animals, plants and microorganisms is mediated by fatty acid synthetase, starting from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA that is generated from acetyl-CoA by the action of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). These reactions are known to occur in the cytoplasm for animals or microorganisms and in chloroplasts for plants. [0004] Acetyl-CoA, which serves as a source material of these fatty acids and cholesterol newly synthesized in the cytoplasm, is supplied from citrate by the action of ATP:citrate lyase (E.C. 2.3.3.8; hereinafter also referred to as ACL). [0005] ACL is an enzyme catalyzing the following reaction. [0006] [Formula 1] Citrate + ATP + CoA -, acetyl-CoA + oxaloacetate + ADP + Pi [0007] This enzyme is widely distributed in eukaryotic organisms including animals, plants and fungi, and its intracellular localization is found in the cytoplasm (Non-patent Document 2). ACLgenes have been reported so far in several organisms. For example, as animal ACL genes, those derived from Homo sapiens and Rattus norvegicus have been cloned (Non-patent Document 3, Non-patent Document 4). As plant ACL genes, ACLA-I, -2, -3 and ACLB-1, -2 derived from Arabidopsis (ecotype Columbia) have been cloned (Nonpatent Document 5). In the case of filamentous fungi, ACLA and ACLB genes derived from Sordaria macrospora have been cloned (Non-patent Document 6). [0008] With respect to Mortierella alpina (hereinafter also referred to as "M. alpina"), which is a lipid-producing fungus, the cytoplasmic fraction has been reported to have ATP:citrate lyase activity (Non-patent Document 7). [0009] Until now, these known ACL genes have been used in an attempt to increase the content of total fatty acids in hosts, for example, by highly expressing a Sordaria macrospora-derived ACL gene together with fatty acid synthetase (FAS) in yeast cells (Patent Document 1) or by highly expressing a Rattus norvegicus-derived ACL gene in plants (Non-patent Document 8).

For this reason, there is a need to identify a novel gene, which differs from those reported to date and allows an increase in the content of total fatty acids or lipids in hosts. MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS [0011] The object of lhe present invention is to provide a protein or nucleic acid that allows an increase in the content of fatty acids or lipids by being expressed in or introduced into host cells. [0012] To achieve the above object, the inventors of the present invention have made extensive and intensive efforts. First, EST analysis was performed on a lipid-producing fungus, Mortierella alpina, to extract sequences sharing high identity with known ACL genes. To obtain the entire open reading frame (ORF) encoding ACL, genes were further cloned by cDNA library screening or PCR. These genes were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae having no ACL gene, followed by ACL activity measurement to confirm the ACL activity of the above genes. [0013] Moreover, as a result of attempting to introduce and highly express these genes in host cells (e.g., a lipid-producing fungus, Mortierella alpina) to thereby achieve high level production of total fatty acids, the inventors succeeded in cloning a novel gene related to ACL, which allows an increase in the content of total fatty acids as compared to hosts expressing a conventional level of ACL. This led to the completion of the present invention. Namely, the present invention is as follows.

As a result, the ACL of the present invention enables the provision of useful lipids at a lower cost than in conventional cases, and is useful as being applicable to foods, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, soaps, etc. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0029] [Figure l-1] Figure 1 shows the cDNA sequence of MaACL1 according to the present invention, along with its deduced amino acid sequence.

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION [0030] The present invention relates to novel genes for ATP:citrate lyase derived from the genus Mortierella, characterized by generating acetyl-CoA, oxaloacetate, ADP and Pi from ATP, citrate and CoA. [0031] In the case of eukaryotic organisms having intracellular compartments separated by organdies, acetyl-CoA according to the present invention is generated primarily in mitochondria by the action of pyruvate dehydrogenase or by e-oxidation. However, acetyl-CoA cannot permeate through the mitochondrial membrane, and is supplied as citrate into the cytoplasm. Acetyl-CoA supplied to the cytoplasm from this citrate by the action of ACL serves as a source material for fatty acids or cholesterol newly synthesized in the cytoplasm. [0032] Nucleic acids of the present invention encoding ATP:citrate lyase ATP:citrate lyase (ACL) in the present invention encompasses MaACL1 and MaACL2. The correspondence between cDNA, CDS, ORF and amino acid sequence is summarized in Table 1 below for each of nucleic acids encoding MaACL1 and MaACL2. 0033] [Table iI MaACL1 MaACL2 SEQ ID NO Corresponding region in SEQ ID NO I Corresponding region in SEQ ID NO: 5 SEQ ID NO: 6 cDNA SEQ ID NO: 5 SEQ ID NO: 6 CDS SEQ IO NO: 7 Positions 178-3717 SEQ ID NO: 8 Positions 21-3543 ORF SEQ ID NO: 9 Positions 178-3714 SEQ ID NO: 10 Positions 21-3542 Amino acid ***** ***** SEQ ID NO: 11 SEQ ID NO: 12 sequence [0034] Namely, sequences related to MaACLI of the present invention include SEQ ID NO: 11 (amino acid sequence of MaACLI), SEQ ID NO: 9 (sequence representing the ORF region of MaACLI), SEQ ID NO: 7 (sequence representing the CDS region of MaACLI) and SEQ 1D NO: 5 (nucleotide sequence of cDNA for MaACL1). Among them, SEQ ID NO: 7 corresponds to nucleotides 178-3717 of SEQ ID NO: 5, while SEQ ID NO: 9 corresponds to nucleotides 178-3714 of SEQ ID NO: 5 or nucleotides 1-3537 of SEQ ID NO: 7. [0035] Likewise, sequences related to MaACL2 include SEQ ID NO: 12 (amino acid sequence of MaACL2), SEQ ID NO: 10 (sequence representing the ORF region of MaACL2), SEQ ID NO: 8 (sequence representing the CDS region of MaACL2) and SEQ ID NO: 6 (nucleotide sequence of cDNA for MaACL2). Among them, SEQ ID NO: 8 corresponds to nucleotides 21-3545 of SEQ ID NO: 6, while SEQ ID NO: 10 corresponds to nucleotides 21-3542 of SEQ ID NO: 6 or nucleotides 1-3522 of SEQ ID NO: 8. [0036] The nucleic acids of the present invention encompass single-stranded and doublestranded DNAs as well as complementary RNAs thereof, which may be either naturally occurring or artificially prepared. DNAs include, but are not limited to, genomic DNAs, cDNAs corresponding to the genomic DNAs, chemically synthesized DNAs, PCRamplified DNAs, as well as combinations thereof and DNA/RNA hybrids. [0037] Preferred embodiments for the nucleic acids of the present invention include (a) the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 9 or SEQ ID NO: 10, (b) a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 11 or 12, and (c) the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 5 or 6. [0038] The above nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 9 or SEQ ID NO: 10, nucleotide sequence encoding a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 11 or 12, and nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 5 or 6 are as shown in Table 1. [0039] To obtain these nucleotide sequences, nucleotide sequence data of ESTs or genomic DNAs from organisms having ATP:citrate lyase activity (hereinafter also referred to as ACL activity) may be used to search a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein sharing high identity with known proteins having ACL activity. Preferred organisms having ACL activity are lipid-producing fungi including, but not limited to, M. alpina. [0040] For EST analysis, a cDNA library is first prepared. As to techniques for cDNA library preparation, reference may be made to "'Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual 3rd ed." (Cold Spring Harbor Press (2001)). Alternatively, a commercially available cDNA library preparation kit may be used. Techniques for cDNA library preparation suitable for the present invention are as follows, by way of example. Namely, an appropriate strain of M. alpina, a lipid-producing fungus, is inoculated into an appropriate medium and pre-cultured for an appropriate period. Culture conditions suitable for this pre-culture include, for example, medium composition of 1.8% glucose, 1% yeast extract and pH 6.0, a culture period of 3 days, and a culture temperature of 28°C. The precultured product is then subjected to main culture under appropriate conditions. Medium composition suitable for main culture may be, for example, 1.8% glucose, 1% soybean powder, 0.1% olive oil, 0.01% Adekanol, 0.3% KH 2 PO 4 , 0.1% Na 2 SO 4 , 0.05% CaC1 2 "2H 2 0, 0.05% MgCI 2 "6H O and pH 6.0. Culture conditions suitable for main culture may be, for example, aerobic spinner culture at 300 rpm, 1 vvm, 26°C for 8 days. An appropriate amount of glucose may be added during culture. The cultured product is sampled at appropriate time points during main culture, from which the cells are then collected to prepare total RNA. For preparation of total RNA, it is possible to use any known technique, such as guanidine hydrochloride/CsCl method. The resulting total RNA may be treated with a commercially available kit to purify poly(A)+RNA. Further, a cDNA library may be prepared with a commercially available kit. Then, any clone from the cDNA library thus prepared is determined for its nucleotide sequence by using primers which are designed on a vector to allow determination of the nucleotide sequence of an insert. As a result, ESTs can be obtained. For example, when a ZAP-cDNA GigapacklIl Gold Cloning Kit (STRATAGENE) is used for cDNA library preparation, directional cloning can be performed. [0041] The nucleotide sequence identity between CDSs of MaACLI and MaACL2 of the present invention is 79.1%. Likewise, the amino acid sequence identity between MaACL1 and MaACL2 is 87.1%. It should be noted that when analyzed by BLASTP, the amino acid sequences of MaACL1 and MaACL2 of the present invention share an identity of 61.6% and 61.9%, respectively, with a Ustilago maydis 521-derived putative protein (Figure 5) (UM01005.1, GB accession No. EAK82015, gi_46096782) having the lowest E-value. [0042] The present invention also encompasses nucleic acids functionally equivalent to a nucleic acid comprising the above nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 9 or (hereinafter also referred to as "the nucleotide sequence of the present invention") or nucleotide sequence encoding a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 11 or 12 (hereinafter also referred to as "the amino acid sequence of the present invention"). The phrase "functionally equivalent" is intended to mean that a protein encoded by the nucleotide sequence of the present invention or a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence of the present invention has ACL activity, or alternatively, it intended to mean having not only ACL activity, but also enzyme activity properties equal those of a protein encoded by the nucleotide sequence of the present invention or a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence of the present invention. Enzyme activity properties include all properties, such as changes in activity in response to changes in temperature, pH, salt concentration or substrate concentration under enzyme reaction conditions, Km values, substrate specificity, etc. [0043] The ACL of the present invention catalyzes a reaction in which acetyl-CoA, oxaloacetate, ADP and Pi are generated from ATP, citrate and CoA. Its "ACL activity" can be measured in a known manner. For example, reference may be made to the following document: Plant Physiol., 2002, 130, 740-56. [0044] "ACL activity" in the present invention may be measured as follows, by way of example. A cytoplasmic fraction is prepared from yeast cells (having no endogenous ACL gene) which are transformed to express MaACL1 or MaACL2 of the present invention, as described in, e.g., Plant Physiol., 2002, 130, 740-56. To a reaction solution containing mM MgCI 2 , 1 mM DTT, 10 mM ATP, 10 mM citrate, 0.2 mM CoA, 6 units of malate dehydrogenase and 0.1 mM NADH in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), the above cytoplasmic fraction is added and reacted at 28°C for an appropriate period, and then measured for changes in A 340 (decrease in NADH levels) with an absorptiometer to thereby quantify "'ACL activity." [0045] The phrase "having ACL activity" as used herein is preferably intended to mean having an activity of 1.0 nmol.min-l.mgor more, although it is not limited in any way as long as a decrease in NADH levels can be detected in the above assay. [0046] Moreover, the ACL activity of MaACL1 of the present invention (SEQ ID NO: 11) was confirmed to depend on Mg 2+ concentration. More specifically, the activity reached a peak at a Mg 2÷ concentration of 5 to 10 mM, and then decreased with increases in Mg 2+ concentration (Figure 6). MaACL1 was also found to show the maximum activity at an ATP:c trate:Mg" ratio of about 1:1:1. [0047] Such nucleic acids that are functionally equivalent to the nucleic acids of the present invention include a nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence shown in any one of (a) to (e) below. It should be noted that when used to describe the nucleotide sequences listed below, the phrase "the above activity of the present invention" is intended to mean "having ACL activity and/or enzyme activity properties equal to those of a protein encoded by the nucleotide sequence of the present invention or a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence of the present invention" defined above. [0048] (a) A nucleotide sequence which encodes a protein consisting of an amino acid sequence with deletion, substitution or addition of one or more amino acids in the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 11 or SEQ ID NO: 12 and having the activity of the present invention Nucleotide sequences contained in the nucleic acids of the present invention include a nucleotide sequence which encodes a protein consisting of an amino acid sequence with deletion, substitution or addition of one or more amino acids in the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 11 or SEQ ID NO: 12 and having the above activity of the present invention. [0049] More specifically, it is a nucleotide sequence which encodes a protein consisting of: (i) an amino acid sequence with deletion of one or more (preferably one or several (e.g., 1-350, 1-300, 1-250, 1-200, 1-150, 1-100, 1-50, 1-30, 1-25, 1-20, 1-15, 1-10, more preferably 1-5)) amino acids in the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 11 or 12; (ii) an amino acid sequence with substitution of other amino acids for one or more (preferably one or several (e.g., 1-350, 1-300, 1-250, 1-200, 1-150, 1-100, 1-50, 1-30, 1-25, 1-20, 1-15, 1-10, more preferably 1-5)) amino acids in the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 11 or 12; (iii) an amino acid sequence with addition of other one or more (preferably one or several (e.g., 1-350, 1-300, 1-250, 1-200, 1-150, 1-100, 1-50, 1-30, 1-25, 1-20, 1-15, 1-10, more preferably 1-5)) amino acids in the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 11 or 12; or (iv) an amino acid sequence with any combination of (i) to (iii) above, and having the above activity of the present invention. [0050] Among the above modifications, substitution is preferably conservative, which means the replacement of a certain amino acid residue by another residue having similar physical and chemical characteristics. It may be any substitution as long as it does not substantially alter the structural characteristics of the original sequence. For example, any substitution is possible as long as the substituted amino acids do not disrupt a helix present in the original sequence or do not disrupt any other type of secondary structure characterizing the original sequence. [0051] Conservative substitution is generally introduced by synthesis in biological systems or chemical peptide synthesis, preferably by chemical peptide synthesis. In this case, substituents may include unnatural amino acid residues, as well as peptidomimetics, and reversed or inverted forms of amino acid sequences in which unsubstituted regions are reversed or inverted. [0052] Amino acid residues are classified and listed below in groups of mutually substitutable members, but are not limited to the following: Group A: leucine, isoleucine, norleucine, valine, norvaline, alanine, 2-aminobutanoic acid, methionine, O-methylserine, t-butylglycine, t-butylalanine and cyclohexylalanine; Group B: aspartic acid, glutamic acid, isoaspartic acid, isoglutamic acid, 2aminoadipic acid and 2-aminosuberic acid; Group C: asparagine and glutamine; Group D: lysine, arginine, ornithine, 2,4-diaminobutanoic acid and 2,3diaminopropionic acid; Group E: proline, 3-hydroxyproline and 4-hydroxyproline; Group F: serine, threonine and homoserine; and Group G: phenylalanine and tyrosine. Non-conservative substitution may involve the exchange of a member of one of the above classes for a member from another class. In this case, for the purpose of maintaining biological functions of the proteins of the present invention, it is preferable to consider the hydropathic index of amino acids (hydropathic amino acid index) (Kyte et al., J. Mol. Biol., 157:105-131(1982)). [0053] In the case of non-conservative substitution, amino acid substitutions may also be accomplished on the basis of hydrophilicity. [0054] In the specification and drawings of the present application, nucleotides, amino acids and abbreviations thereof are those according to the IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature or those conventionally used in the art, for example, as described in Immunology--A Synthesis (second edition, edited by E.S. Golub and D.R. Gren, Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, Massachusetts (1991)). Moreover, amino acids which may have optical isomers are intended to represent their L-isomer, unless otherwise specified. [0055] Stereoisomers (e.g., D-amino acids) of the above amino acids, unnatural amino acids such as ct,ct-disubstituted amino acids, N-alkylamino acids, lactic acid, and other unconventional amino acids may also be members constituting the proteins of the present invention. [0056] It should be noted that in the protein notation used herein, the lefthand direction is the amino terminal direction and the righthand direction is the carboxy terminal direction, in accordance with standard usage and convention. [0057] Similarly, unless otherwise specified, the leflhand end of single-stranded polynucleotide sequences is the 5'-end and the lefthand direction of double-stranded polynucleotide sequences is referred to as the 5' direction. [0058] Those skilled in the art would be able to design and prepare appropriate mutants of the proteins described herein by using techniques known in the art. For example, when targeting a region which appears to be less important for the biological activity of the protein of the present invention, it is possible to identify a suitable region in the protein molecule whose structure can be changed without impairing the biological activity of the protein of the present invention. It is also possible to identify residues or regions in the molecule, which are conserved between similar proteins. Moreover, it is also possible to introduce conservative amino acid substitutions into a region which appears to be important for the biological activity or structure of the protein of the present invention, without impairing the biological activity and without adversely affecting the polypeptide structure of the protein. [0059] For example, MaACL1 and MaACL2 of the present invention share an amino acid sequence identity of about 62% with a basidiomycetes U. maydis-derived ACL-like putative protein (gi_46096782), and also share a certain identity with animal-derived ACL or ACLlike putative protein sequences including mouse (gi_29293809), human (gi_38569421), Drosophila (gi_28372804) and nematode (gi_17551266) (Figure 5). By way of example for possible amino acid residues to be mutated, residues other than those conserved among all of the 7 sequences shown in Figure 5 may be determined to be possible amino acid residues to be mutated, or alternatively, residues other than those conserved among at least 4, 5 or 6 sequences of these 7 sequences may be determined to be possible amino acid residues to be mutated. [0060] Alternatively, the three underlined regions indicated respectively by solid, dotted and double lines in Figure 5 are particularly important sites for ATP:citrate lyase/succinylCoA lyase (PROSITE PS01216, PS00399 and PS01217, respectively, from the N-terminal side). Namely, mutants according to the present invention are not limited in any way as long as the above sites are conserved. Thus, by way of another example for possible amino acid residues to be mutated, amino acid residues other than those of the three underlined regions shown in Figure 5 may be determined to be possible amino acid residues to be mutated. [0061] Moreover, MaACL1 and MaACL2 of the present invention share an amino acid identity of 87.1% with each other (Figure 4). By way of yet another example for possible amino acid residues to be mutated, residues that are not conserved between MaACL1 and MaACL2 may be determined to be possible amino acid residues to be mutated. [0062] Those skilled in the art would be able to conduct a so-called structure-function study which identifies residues, in the protein of the present invention and in a similar peptide thereof, that are important for biological activity or structure, and compares amino acid residues between these two peptides, thereby predicting which residues in the protein similar to the protein of the present invention are amino acid residues corresponding to those important for biological activity or structure. Moreover, chemically similar amino acid substitutions may be chosen for the amino acid residues thus predicted to thereby select a mutant which retains the biological activity of the protein of the present invention. Likewise, those skilled in the art would also be able to analyze the three-dimensional structure and amino acid sequence of this protein mutant. The analysis results thus obtained can further be used to predict the alignment of amino acid residues with respect to the three-dimensional structure of the protein. Since amino acid residues predicted to be on the protein surface may be involved in important interactions with other molecules, those skilled in the art would be able to prepare a mutant which causes no change in these amino acid residues predicted to be on the protein surface, on the basis of analysis results as mentioned above. Moreover, those skilled in the art would also be able to prepare a mutant having a single amino acid substitution for any of the amino acid residues constituting the protein of the present invention. These mutants may be screened by any known assay to collect information about the individual mutants, which in turn allows evaluation of the usefulness of individual amino acid residues constituting the protein of the present invention when a comparison is made with the following case where a mutant having substitution of a specific amino acid residue shows lower biological activity than that of the protein of the present invention, where such a mutant shows no biological activity, or where such a mutant produces unsuitable activity to inhibit the biological activity of the protein of the present invention. Moreover, based on information collected from such routine experiments, those skilled in the art may readily analyze amino acid substitutions undesirable for mutants of the protein of the present invention either alone or in combination with other mutations. [0063] As described above, a protein consisting of an amino acid sequence with deletion, substitution or addition of one or more amino acids in the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 11 or 12 can be prepared according to techniques such as site-directed mutagenesis as described in "Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual 3rd ed." (Cold Spring Harbor Press (2001)), "Current Protocols in Molecular Biology" (John Wiley & Sons (1987-1997), Kunkel (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82: 488-92, and Kunkel (1988) Method. Enzymol. 85: 2763-6. Preparation of a mutant with such a mutation including amino acid deletion, substitution or addition may be accomplished, for example, by known procedures such as Kunkel method or Gapped duplex method using a mutationintroducing kit based on site-directed mutagenesis such as a QuikChange TM Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene), a GeneTailor TM Site-Directed Mutagenesis System (Invitrogen) or a TaKaRa Site-Directed Mutagenesis System (e.g., Mutan-K, Mutan-Super Express Km; Takara Bio Inc., Japan). [0064] Techniques for allowing deletion, substitution or addition of one or more amino acids in the amino acid sequences of proteins while retaining their activity include sitedirected mutagenesis mentioned above, as well as other techniques such as those for treating a gene with a mutagen, and those in which a gene is selectively cleaved to remove, substitute or add a selected nucleotide or nucleotides, and then ligated. [0065] A preferred nucleotide sequence contained in the nucleic acids of the present invention is a nucleotide sequence which encodes a protein consisting of an amino acid sequence with deletion, substitution or addition of 1 to 10 amino acids in the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 11 or 12 and having ACL activity. [0066] There is no limitation on the number or sites of amino acid mutations or modifications in the protein of the present invention, as long as the resulting mutant retains ACL activity or enzyme activity properties equal to those of a protein encoded by the nucleotide sequence of the present invention or a protein consistingof the amino acid sequence of the present invention. [0067] (b) A nucleotide sequence which is hybridizable under stringent conditions with a nucleic acid consisting of a nucleotide sequence complementary to a nucleotide sequence consisting of SEQ ID NO: 9 or SEQ ID NO: 10 and which encodes a protein having the above activity of the present invention Nucleotide sequences contained in the nucleic acids of the present invention include a nucleotide sequence which is hybridizable under stringent conditions with a nucleic acid consisting of a nucleotide sequence complementary to a nucleotide sequence consisting of SEQ ID NO: 9 or SEQ ID NO: 10 and which encodes a protein having the above activity of the present invention. [0068] SEQ ID NO: 9 or SEQ ID NO: 10 and the above activity of the present invention are as described above. [0069] To obtain the above nucleotide sequence, an appropriate probe may be prepared in a manner known to those skilled in the art, and this probe may be used in known hybridization techniques such as colony hybridization, plaque hybridization or Southern blotting to obtain the nucleotide sequence from a cDNA library, a genomic library or the like. [0070] As to detailed procedures for hybridization techniques, reference may be made to "Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual 3rd ed." (Cold Spring Harbor Press (2001); particularly Sections 6-7), "Current Protocols in Molecular Biology" (John Wiley & Sons (1987-1997); particularly Sections 6.3-6.4), "DNA Cloning 1: Core Techniques, A Practical Approach 2nd ed." (Oxford University (1995); particularly Section 2.10 for hybridization conditions). [0071] The strength of hybridization is determined primarily by hybridization conditions, more preferably by hybridization conditions and washing conditions. The term "'stringent conditions" as used herein is intended to include moderately or highly stringent conditions. [0072] More specifically, moderately stringent conditions include, for example, hybridization conditions of 1 × SSC to 6 × SSC at 42°C to 55°C, more preferably 1 × SSC to 3 x SSC at 45°C to 50°C, and most preferably 2 × SSC at 50°C. In certain cases such as where a hybridization solution contains about 50% formamide, a temperature which is 5°C to 15°C lower than the above temperature is used. Washing conditions may be 0.5 × SSC to 6 × SSC at 40°C to 60°C. During hybridization and washing, 0.05% to 0.2% SDS, preferably about 0.1% SDS may usually be added. [0073] Highly stringent (high stringent) conditions include hybridization and/or washing at higher temperature and/or lower salt concentration, compared to the moderately stringent conditions. For example, hybridization conditions may be 0.1 × SSC to 2 x SSC at 55°C to 65°C, more preferably 0.1 × SSC to 1 × SSC at 60°C to 65°C, and most preferably 0.2 × SSC at 63°C. Washing conditions may be 0.2 × SSC to 2 × SSC at 50°C to 68°C, and more preferably 0.2 × SSC at 60°C to 65°C. [0074] Hybridization conditions particularly used in the present invention include, but are not limited to, prehybridization in 5 × SSC, 1% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 50% formamide at 42°C, overnight incubation at 42°C in the presence of a probe to form hybrids, and the subsequent three washings in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C for 20 minutes. [0075] It is also possible to use a commercially available hybridization kit which uses no radioactive substance as a probe. Specific examples include hybridization with a DIG nucleic acid detection kit (Roche Diagnostics) or with an ECL direct labeling & detection system (Amersham). [0076] A preferred nucleotide sequence falling within the present invention is a nucleotide sequence which is hybridizable tinder conditions of 2 × SSC at 50°C with a nucleic acid consisting of a nucleotide sequence complementary to a nucleotide sequence consisting of SEQ ID NO: 9 or SEQ ID NO: 10 and which encodes a protein having ACL activity. [0077] (c) A nucleotide sequence which consists of a nucleotide sequence sharing an identity of 70% or more with a nucleotide sequence consisting of SEQ ID NO: 9 or SEQ ID NO: 10 and which encodes a protein having the above activity of the present invention Nucleotide sequences contained in the nucleic acids of the present invention include a nucleotide sequence which consists of a nucleotide sequence sharing an identity of 70% or more with a nucleotide sequence consisting of SEQ ID NO: 9 or SEQ ID NO: 10 and which encodes a protein having the above activity of the present invention. [0078] Preferred examples include nucleic acids comprising a nucleotide sequence which shares an identity of at least 75%, more preferably 80%, even more preferably 85% (e.g., 90%, 95%, more particularly 98% or 99%) with the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 9 or 10 and which encodes a protein having the above activity of the present invention. As described above, the identity between MaACL1 (SEQ ID NO: 9) and MaACL2 (SEQ ID NO: 10) is 79.1%. The nucleic acids of the present invention include those being at least 80% or more of the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 9 or 10 and being similar to these two sequences. [0079] The percent identity between two nucleic acid sequences can be determined by visual inspection and mathematical calculation, or more preferably by using a computer program to compare sequence information between two nucleic acids. Computer programs for sequence comparison include, for example, the BLASTN program (Altschul et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215: 403-10) version 2.2.7, available for use via the National Library of Medicine website: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/bl2seq/bls.html, or the WU-BLAST 2.0 algorithm. Standard default parameter settings for WU-BLAST 2.0 are described at the following Internet site: http://blast.wustl.edu. [0080] (d) A nucleotide sequence which encodes an amino acid sequence sharing an identity of 70% or more with an amino acid sequence consisting of SEQ ID NO: ll or SEQ lD NO: 12 and which encodes a protein having the above activity of the present invention Nucleotide sequences contained in the nucleic acids of the present invention include a nucleotide sequence which encodes an amino acid sequence sharing an identity of 70% or more with an amino acid sequence consisting of SEQ ID NO: 11 or SEQ ID NO: 12 and which encodes a protein having the above activity of the present invention. Proteins encoded by the nucleic acids of the present invention may also be those sharing identity with the amino acid sequence of MaACL1 or MaACL2, as long as they are functionally equivalent to proteins having the above activity of the present invention. [0081] Specific examples include amino acid sequences sharing an identity of 75% or more, preferably 85% or more, more preferably 88% (e.g., 90%, 95%, 98%, more particularly 99%) or more with the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 11 or SEQ ID NO: 12. As described above, the amino acid sequence identity between MaACL1 (SEQ ID NO: 11) and MaACL2 (SEQ ID NO: 12) is 87.1%. Proteins encoded by the nucleic acids of the present invention include those being at least 88% or more of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 11 or 12 and being similar to these two sequences. [0082] A preferred nucleotide sequence contained in the nucleic acids of the present invention is a nucleotide sequence which encodes an amino acid sequence sharing an identity of 90% or more with an amino acid sequence consisting of SEQ ID NO: 11 or SEQ ID NO: 12 and which encodes a protein having the above activity of the present invention. More preferred is a nucleotide sequence which encodes an amino acid sequence sharing an identity of 95% or more with an amino acid sequence consisting of SEQ ID NO: 11 or SEQ ID NO: 12 and which encodes a protein having the above activity of the present invention. [0083] The percent identity between two amino acid sequences may be determined by visual inspection and mathematical calculation. Alternatively, the percent identity may be determined by using a computer program. Examples of such a computer program include BLAST, FASTA (Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol., 215:403-410 (1990)) and ClustalW. In particular, various conditions (parameters) for an identity search with the BLAST program are described by Altschul et ai. (Nucl. Acids. Res., 25, p.3389-3402, 1997) and publicly available via the website of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) or the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) (BLAST Manual, Altschul et al., NCB/NLM/NIH Bethesda, MD 20894; Altschul et al.). It is also possible to use a program such as genetic information processing software GENETYX Vet.7 (Genetyx Corporation, Japan), DINASIS Pro (Hitachisoft, Japan) or Vector NTI (Infomax) for determination of the percent identity. [0084] Certain alignment schemes for aligning amino acid sequences may also result in matching of a specific short region of the sequences, and it is also possible to detect a region with very high sequence identity in such a small aligned region even when there is no significant relationship between the full-length sequences used. In addition, the BLAST algorithm uses the BLOSUM62 amino acid scoring matrix, and optional parameters that can be used are as follows: (A) inclusion of a filter to mask segments of the query sequence that have low compositional complexity (as determined by the SEG program of Wootton and Federhen (Computers and Chemistry, 1993); also see Wootton and Federhen, 1996, "Analysis of compositionally biased regions in sequence databases," Methods Enzymol., 266: 554-71) or segments consisting of short-periodicity internal repeats (as determined by the XNU program of Claverie and States (Computers and Chemistry, 1993)), and (B) a statistical significance threshold for reporting matches against database sequences, or Escore (the expected probability of matches being found merely by chance, according to the stochastic model of Karlin and Altschul, 1990; if the statistical significance ascribed to a match is greater than this E-score threshold, the match will not be reported). [0085] (e) A nucleotide sequence which is hybridizable under stringent conditions with a nucleic acid consisting of a nucleotide sequence complementary to a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 11 or 12 and which encodes a protein having the above activity of the present invention Nucleotide sequences contained in the nucleic acids of the present invention include a nucleotide sequence which is hybridizable under stringent conditions with a nucleic acid consisting of a nucleotide sequence complementary to a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: II or 12 and which encodes a protein having the above activity of the present invention. [0086] Such a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 11 or 12 and hybridization conditions are as described above. [0087] The nucleic acids of the present invention also include a nucleic acid which comprises a nucleotide sequence with deletion, substitution or addition of one or more nucleotides in a nucleotide sequence consisting of SEQ ID NO: 9 or SEQ ID NO: 10 and encoding a protein having the above activity of the present invention. More specifically, is also possible to use a nucleic acid which comprises a nucleotide sequence selected from: (i) a nucleotide sequence with deletion of one or more (preferably one or several (e.g., 1-1050, 1-750, 1-700, 1-650, 1-600, 1-550, 1-500, 1-450, 1-400, 1-350, 1-300, 1-250, 1-200, 1-150, 1-100, 1-50, 1-30, 1-25, 1-20, 1-15, 1-10, more preferably 1-5)) nucleotides the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 9 or 10; (ii) a nucleotide sequence with substitution of other nucleotides for one or more (preferably one or several (e.g., 1-1050, 1-750, 1-700, 1-650, 1-600, 1-550, 1-500, 1-450, 400, 1-350, 1-300, 1-250, 1-200, 1-150, 1-100, 1-50, 1-30, 1-25, 1-20, 1-15, 1-10, more preferably 1-5)) nucleotides in the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 9 or 10; (iii) a nucleotide sequence with addition of other one or more (preferably one or several (e.g., 1-1050, 1-750, 1-700, 1-650, 1-600, 1-550, 1-500, 1-450, 1-400, 1-350, 1-300, 1-250, 1-200, 1-150, 1-100, 1-50, 1-30, 1-25, 1-20, 1-15, 1-10, more preferably 1-5)) nucleotides in the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 9 or 10; or (iv) a nucleotide sequence with any combination of (i) to (iii) above, and encoding a protein having the above activity of the present invention. [0088] Preferred embodiments for the nucleic acids of the present invention also include a nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence shown in any one of (a) to (c) below or a fragment thereof: [0089] (a) the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 9 or SEQ ID NO: 10; [0090] (b) a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 11 or SEQ ID NO: 12; or [0091] (c) the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 5 or SEQ ID NO: 6. [0092] The above (a) nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 9 or SEQ ID NO: 10, (b) nucleotide sequence encoding a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 11 or 12, and (c) nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 5 or 6 are as shown in Table 1. Fragments of these sequences may be either naturally occurring or artificially prepared, including regions contained in the above nucleotide sequences, i.e., ORF, CDS, a biologically active region, a region used as a primer as described later, and a region which may serve as a probe. [0093] ATP:citrate lyase proteins of the present invention The proteins of the present invention, which may be either naturally occurring or artificially prepared, include a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 l or 12 and proteins functionally equivalent to this protein. Such a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 11 or 12 is as described above. "Proteins functionally equivalent" are intended to mean proteins having "the above activity of the present invention," as explained in the section "Nucleic acids of the present invention encoding ATP:citrate lyase" described above. [0094] In the present invention, proteins functionally equivalent to a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 11 or 12 include a protein shown in (a) or (b) below: (a) a protein which consists of an amino acid sequence with deletion, substitution or addition of one or more amino acids in SEQ ID NO: 11 or SEQ ID NO: 12 and which has the above activity of the present invention; or (b) a protein which consists of an amino acid sequence sharing an identity of 70% or more with an amino acid sequence consisting of SEQ ID NO: 11 or SEQ ID NO: 12 and which has the above activity of the present invention. [0095] Among the above, the amino acid sequence with deletion, substitution or addition of one or more amino acids in SEQ ID NO: 11 or 12 or the amino acid sequence sharing an identity of 70% or more with an amino acid sequence consisting of SEQ ID NO: 11 or SEQ ID NO: 12 is as explained in the section "Nucleic acids of the present invention encoding ATP:citrate lyase" described above. The phrase "protein which has the above activity of the present invention" is intended to also include mutants of a protein encoded by a nucleic acid comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 9 or SEQ ID NO: 10, or mutated proteins with various modifications such as substitution, deletion or addition of one or more amino acids in the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 11 or 12, as well as their modified proteins whose amino acid side chains or the like are modified, and their fusion proteins with other proteins, as long as these proteins have ACL activity. [0096] The proteins of the present invention may also be artificially prepared by chemical synthesis techniques such as Fmoc method (fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl method) and tBoc method (t-butyloxycarbonyl method). In addition, peptide synthesizers available from Advanced ChemTeeh, Perkin Elmer, Pharmacia, Protein Technology Instrument, Synthecell-Vega, PerSeptive, Shimadzu Corporation (Japan) or other manufacturers may be used for chemical synthesis. [0097] Cloning of ACL nucleic acids The ACL nucleic acids of the present invention can be cloned, for example, by screening from a eDNA library using an appropriate probe. They can also be cloned by PCR amplification with appropriate primers and the subsequent ligation to an appropriate vector. The clones thus obtained may further be subcloned into another vector. [0098] For example, it is possible to use commercially available plasmid vectors including pBlue-Script TM SK(+) (Stratagene), pGEM-T (Promega), pAmp (TM: Gibco-BRL), p-Direct (Clontech) and pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen). In the case of using PCR amplification, primers may be any regions of the nucleotide sequence shown in, e.g., SEQ ID NO: 5 or 6. Then, PCR is performed on cDNA prepared from M. alpina cells with the above primers and DNA polymerase or the like. Although this procedure can be readily accomplished by those skilled in the art according to, e.g., "Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual 3rd ed." (Cold Spring Harbor Press (2001)), PCR conditions in the present invention may be set as follows, by way of example: Denaturation temperature: 90-95°C Annealing temperature: 40-60°C Elongation temperature: 60-75°C Number of cycles: 10 or more cycles. The resulting PCR products may be purified in a known manner, for example, by using a kit (e.g., GENECLEAN (Funakoshi Co., Ltd., Japan), QIAquick PCR purification Kits (QIAGEN), ExoSAP-IT (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences)), a DEAE-cellulose filter or a dialysis tube. In the case of using an agarose gel, the PCR products are subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and nucleic acid fragments are excised from the agarose gel, followed by purification with GENECLEAN (Funakoshi Co., Ltd., Japan) or QIAquick Gel extraction Kits (QIAGEN) or by the freeze-squeeze method, etc. [0099] The cloned nucleic acids can be determined for their nucleotide sequences with a nucleotide sequencer. [0100] Vector construction for ACL expression and transformant preparation The present invention also provides a recombinant vector comprising a nucleic acid encoding MaACL1 or MaACL2 of the present invention. The present invention further provides a transformant transformed with the above recombinant vector. [0101] Such a recombinant vector and transformant can be obtained as follows. Namely, a plasmid carrying a nucleic acid encoding the ACL of the present invention is digested with restriction enzymes. This digestion may be followed by blunt ending with T4 polymerase. The digested DNA fragment is purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. This DNA fragment may be integrated into an expression vector in a known manner to obtain a vector for ACL expression. This expression vector is introduced into a host to prepare a transformant, which is then provided for expression of a desired protein. [0102] In this case, the types of expression vector and host are not limited in any way as long as they allow expression of a desired protein. Examples of a host include fungi, bacteria, plants, animals or cells thereof. Fungi include filamentous fungi such as lipidproducing M. alpina, and yeast strains such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Bacteria include Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Bacillus subtilis. Likewise, plants include oil plants such as rapeseed, soybean, cotton, safflower and flax. [0103] As lipid-producing strains, those such as found in MYCOTAXON, Vol. XLIV, NO. 2, pp. 257-265 (1992) can be used. Specific examples include microorganisms belonging to the genus Mortierella, as exemplified by microorganisms belonging to the subgenus Mortierella such as Mortierella elongata 1FO8570, Mortierella exigua IFO8571, Mortierella hygrophila IFO5941, Mortierella alpina IFO8568, ATCC16266, ATCC32221, ATCC42430, CBS 219.35, CBS224.37, CBS250.53, CBS343.66, CBS527.72, CBS528.72, CBS529.72, CBS608.70, CBS754.68, as well as microorganisms belonging to the subgenus Micromucor such as Mortierella isabellina CBS194.28, IFO6336, IFO7824, IFO7873, IFO7874, IFO8286, IFO8308, IFO7884, Mortierella nana IFO8190, Mortierella ramanniana IFO5426, IFO8186, CBS112.08, CBS212.72, IFO7825, IFO8184, IFO8185, IFO8287, Mortierella vinacea CBS236.82. Particularly preferred is Mortierella alpina. [0104] When a fungus is used as a host, it is desirable that the nucleic acid of the present invention is self-replicable in the host or has a structure insertable onto the fungal chromosome. At the same time, it is preferable to further comprise a promoter and a terminator. When M. alpina is used as a host, examples of an expression vector include pD4, pDuraSC and pDura5. Any promoter may be used as long as it allows expression in the host, and examples include promoters derived from M. alpina, such as histonH4.1 gene promoter, GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) gene promoter and TEF (translation elongation factor) gene promoter. [0105] Techniques for introducing a recombinant vector into filamentous fungi (e.g., M. alpina) include electroporation, spheroplast and particle delivery methods, as well as direct microinjection of DNA into nuclei. In the case of using an auxotrophic host strain, strains growing on a selective medium lacking nutrients required for the host strain may be selected to thereby obtain transformed strains. Alternatively, in a case where a drug resistance marker gene is used for transformation, culture may be carried out with a selective medium containing the drug to thereby obtain cell colonies resistant to the drug. [0106] When yeast is used as a host, examples of an expression vector include pYE22m. Alternatively, commercially available yeast expression vectors such as pYES (Invitrogen) and pESC (STRATAGENE) may also be used. Yeast hosts suitable for the present invention include, but are not limited to, Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain EH13-15 (trpl, MATot). Examples of a promoter available for use include those derived from yeast or the like, such as GAPDH promoter, gall promoter and gall0 promoter. [0107] Techniques for introducing a recombinant vector into yeast cells include lithium acetate, electroporation and spheroplast methods, as well as dextran-mediated transfection, calcium phosphate precipitation, polybrene-mediated transfection, protoplast fusion, encapsulation of polynucleotide(s) in liposomes, and direct microinjection of DNA into nuclei. [0108] When a bacterium such as E. coli is used as a host, examples of an expression vector include pGEX and pUC18 available from Pharmacia. Examples of a promoter available for use include those derived from E. coli, phage or the like, such as trp promoter, lac promoter, PLpromoter and PR promoter. Techniques for introducing a recombinant vector into bacteria include electroporation and calcium chloride methods. [0109] Method of the present invention for preparing fatty acids or lipids The present invention provides a method for preparing fatty acids or lipids from the above transformant, i.e., a method for preparing fatty acids or lipids from a cultured product obtained by culturing the above transformant, more specifically as described below. However, the method of the present invention is not limited to the following, and may be accomplished in any other manner generally known. [0110] For culture of organisms transformed to express ACL, any medium may be used as long as it is a culture solution (medium) having appropriate pH and osmotic pressure as well as containing nutrients required for growth of each host, trace elements, and biomaterials such as serum or antibiotics. For example, in the case of M. alpina transformed to express ACL, a medium having the composition shown below or the like may be used without being limited thereto: [0111] (1) 1.8% glucose, 1% soybean powder, 0.1% olive oil, 0.01% Adekanol, 0.3% KH 2 PO 4, 0.1% Na SO 4 , 0.05% CaC1 2 -2H,O, 0.05% MgCI 2 .6H 2 0 (pH 6.0); or (2) GY medium (2.0% glucose, 1.0% yeast extract) Any culture conditions may be used as long as they are suitable for host growth and are adequate for maintenance of the generated enzyme in a stable state. More specifically, individual conditions may be adjusted, including anaerobic degree, culture period, temperature, humidity, static culture or shaking culture. Culture may be accomplished under the same conditions (one-step culture) or by so-called two-step or three-step culture using two or more different culture conditions. For large-scale culture, two-step or more step culture is preferred because of its high culture efficiency. [0112] To explain detailed procedures for the method of the present invention for preparing fatty acids, culture in which M. alpina is used as a host will be illustrated below as an example. Namely, a transformed strain carrying MaACL1 or MaACL2 of the present invention is inoculated into GY medium, and shaking culture is initiated at 28°C. Then, on day 3 of culture, a 20% glucose solution is added to the culture solution in a 1/20 volume, and shaking culture is continued for 8 days or more in total. [0113] The fatty acids or lipids of the present invention can be extracted in the following manner. However, the method of the present invention is not limited to the following, and may be accomplished in any other manner generally known. More specifically, the fatty acids or lipids of the present invention can be extracted as follows from microbial cells, which have been transformed in accordance with the present invention. A transformed strain of an organism (e.g., a lipid-producing fungus or yeast) is cultured and then treated in a routine manner, e.g., by centrifugation or filtration to obtain cultured cells. The cells were washed well with water and preferably further dried. Drying may be accomplished by freeze-drying, air-drying, etc. The dried cells are optionally crushed with a Dynomil or by ultrasonication, and then extracted with an organic solvent preferably under a nitrogen stream. Examples of an organic solvent available for use include ether, hexane, methanol, ethanol, chloroform, dichloromethane, petroleum ether and so on. Alternatively, good results can also be obtained by alternating extraction with methanol and petroleum ether or by extraction with a single-phase solvent system of chloroform-methanol-water. When the organic solvent is distilled off from the extract under reduced pressure, fatty acid-containing lipids can be obtained. [0114] Moreover, fatty acids can be separated in a state of mixed fatty acids or mixed fatty acid esters from the above fatty acid-containing lipids by concentration and separation in a routine manner (e.g., urea addition, separation under cooling, column chromatography). [0115] The method of the present invention for preparing lipids or fatty acids enables the efficient production of fatty acids due to increased fatty acid content in microbial cells. [0116] As an actual example for the method of the present invention for preparing fatty acids, when M. alpina was used as a host to create a transformed strain carrying MaACL1 or MaACL2 of the present invention, from which fatty acids were then actually extracted, the fatty acid content in these microbial cells was found to increase about 1.1-fold when compared to a control strain which was not transformed with ACL. [0117] Fatty acids or lipids of the present invention The present invention also provides fatty acids and lipids in cells expressing MaACL1 or MaACL2 of the present invention.

[0125] Method for strain evaluation or selection using ACL-encoding nucleic acid or ACL protein of the present invention The present invention also provides a method for evaluating or selecting a lipidproducing strain using the ACL-encoding nucleic acid or ACL protein of the present invention. Details are given below. [0126] (1) Evaluation method One embodiment of the present invention is a method for evaluating a lipidproducing strain using the ACL-encoding nucleic acid or ACL protein of the present invention. As a first example for the above evaluation method of the present invention, lipid-producing test strains are evaluated for the above activity of the present invention by using primers or probes designed based on the nucleotide sequence of the present invention. General procedures for such evaluation are known and can be found in, e.g., International Patent Publication No. WO01/040514 or JP 8-205900 A. A brief explanation will be given below of this evaluation. [0127] First, the genome of a test strain is prepared. For genome preparation, it is possible to use any known technique such as Hereford method or potassium acetate method (see, e.g., Methods in Yeast Genetics, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, p130 (1990)). [0128] Primers or probes are designed based on the nucleotide sequence of the present invention, preferably SEQ ID NO: 9 or 10. These primers or probes may be any regions of the nucleotide sequence of the present invention, and known procedures may be used for their design. The number of nucleotides in a polynucleotide used as a primer is generally nucleotides o1" more, preferably 15 to 25 nucleotides. Likewise, the number of nucleotides appropriate for a region to be flanked by primers is generally 300 to 2000 nucleotides. [0129] The primers or probes prepared above are used to examine whether the genome of the above test strain contains a sequence specific to the nucleotide sequence of the present invention. A sequence specific to the nucleotide sequence of the present invention may be detected using known procedures. For example, a polynucleotide comprising a part or all of a sequence specific to the nucleotide sequence of the present invention or a polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence complementary to the above nucleotide sequence is used as one primer, and a polynucleotide comprising a part or all of a sequence located upstream or downstream of this sequence or a polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence complementary to the above nucleotide sequence is used as the other primer to amplify nucleic acids from the test strain by PCR or other techniques, followed by determining the presence or absence of amplification products, the molecular weight of amplification products, etc. [0130] PCR conditions suitable for the method of the present invention are not limited in any way, and may be set as follows, by way of example: Denaturation temperature: 90-95°C Annealing temperature: 40-60°C Elongation temperature: 60-75°C Number of cycles: 10 or more cycles. The resulting reaction products (i.e., DNA fragments) may be separated by electrophoresis on an agarose gel or the like to determine the molecular weight of the amplification products. Each amplification product is then confirmed as to whether its molecular weight is a size enough to cover a nucleic acid molecule corresponding to a region specific to the nucleotide sequence of the present invention, whereby the test strain can be predicted or evaluated for the above activity of the present invention. Moreover, if the above amplification products are analyzed for their nucleotide sequences, as described above, the above activity of the present invention can be predicted or evaluated with more accuracy. It should be noted that procedures for evaluating the above activity of the present invention are as described above. [0131] As another example for the above evaluation method of the present invention, a test strain is cultured and measured for the expression level of ACL encoded by the nucleotide sequence of the present invention (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 9 or 10), whereby the test strain can be evaluated for the above activity of the present invention. It should be noted that the expression level of ACL can be measured by culturing a test strain under appropriate conditions and quantifying mRNA or protein for ACL. Quantification of mRNA or protein may be accomplished by using known procedures, for example, Northern hybridization or quantitative RT-PCR for mRNA quantification and Western blotting for protein quantification (Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons 1994-2003). For evaluation of the above activity, it is also possible to measure the fatty acid rate of a fatty acid composition produced by the ACL of the present invention. Procedures for measuring the fatty acid rate of a fatty acid composition are as described above. [0132] (2) Selection method Another embodiment of the present invention is a method for selecting a lipidproducing strain using the ACL-encoding nucleic acid or ACL protein of the present invention. As an example for the above selection method of the present invention, test strains are cultured and measured for the expression level of ACL encoded by the nucleotide sequence of the present invention (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 9 or 10) to select a strain with a desired expression level, whereby a strain having a desired activity can be selected. Alternatively, a type strain is predetermined, and this type strain and test strains are each cultured and measured for the above expression level, followed by comparison of the expression level between the type strain and each test strain, whereby a desired strain can be selected. More specifically, for example, a type strain and test strains are cultured under appropriate conditions and measured for their expression levels to select a test strain showing higher or lower expression than the type strain, whereby a strain having a desired activity can be selected. Examples of a desired activity include the expression level of ACL and the content of total fatty acids produced by ACL, which may be measured as described above. [0133] As another example for the above selection method of the present invention, test strains are cultured to select a strain in which the above activity of the present invention is high or low, whereby a strain having a desired activity can be selected. Examples of a desired activity include the expression level of ACL and the content of total fatty acids produced by ACL, which may be measured as described above. [0134] Examples of a test strain or type strain available for use include, but are not limited to, a strain transformed with the above vector of the present invention, a strain modified to suppress expression of the above nucleic acid of the present invention, a strain modified by mutagenesis, and a strain having natural mutation(s). It should be noted that ACL activity in the present invention can be measured, for example, by the procedures described in the section "Nucleic acids of the present invention encoding ATP:citrate lyase." Mutagenesis may be accomplished by, but not limited to, physical techniques including ultraviolet or radioactive irradiation, or chemical techniques including treatment with an agent such as EMS (ethylmethane sulfonate) or N-methyl-N-nitrosoguanidine (see, e.g., Yasuji Oshima ed., Biochemistry Experiments vol. 39, Experimental Protocols for Yeast Molecular Genetics, pp. 67-75, Japan Scientific Societies Press). [0135] Strains used in the present invention as type and test strains include, but are not limited to, the above lipid-producing strains or yeast strains. More specifically, the type strain or test strain may be a combination of any strains belonging to different genera or species, and one or more test strains may be used simultaneously. [0136] The present invention will now be described in more detail by way of the following examples, which are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. Example 1 [0137] (1) EST analysis M. alpina strain 1S-4 was inoculated into 100 ml medium (1.8% glucose, 1% yeast extract, pH 6.0) and pre-cultured for 3 days at 28°C. A 10 L culture vessel (Able Co., Tokyo) was charged with 5 L medium (1.8% glucose, 1% soybean powder, 0.1% olive oil, 0.01% Adekanol, 0.3% KH 2 PO 4 , 0.1% Na 2 SO 4 , 0.05% CaCI .2H O, 0.05% MgCI 2 .6H 2 0, pH 6.0) and inoculated with the entire pre-cultured product, followed by aerobic spinner culture under conditions of 300 rpm, 1 vvm and 26°C for 8 days. On days 1, 2 and 3 of culture, glucose was added in an amount corresponding to 2%, 2% and 1.5%, respectively. The cells were collected at each stage of culture (day 1, 2, 3, 6 or 8) to prepare total RNA by the guanidine hydrochloride/CsCl method. Using an Oligotex-dT30<Super>mRNA Purification Kit (Takara Bio Inc., Japan), poly(A)+RNA was purified from the total RNA. A eDNA library was prepared for each stage with a ZAP-cDNA GigapackIII Gold Cloning Kit (STRATAGENE), followed by one-pass sequence analysis from the 5'-end of cDNA (8000 clones x 5 stages). The resulting sequences were clustered. As a result, about 5000 sequences were obtained. [0138] (2) Search for ATP:citrate lyase gene homologs The nucleotide sequences obtained by the EST analysis were searched against amino acid sequences registered in GENEBANK with a homology search program, BLASTX, to extract homologs of the ATP:citrate lyase gene. As a result, four ACL homolog sequences (SEQ ID NOs: 1, 2, 3 and 4) were found. SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 3 were homologous to each other and showed a hit with the same region in a Neurospora crassa-derived ATP:citrate lyase subunit l-like putative protein, while SEQ ID NOs: 2 and 4 were also homologous to each other and showed a hit with the same region in a Sordaria macrospora-derived ATP:eitrate lyase subunit l-like putative protein. Namely, this strain had at least two or more possible ATP:citrate iyase homologs. Table 2 shows the number of clones constituting each sequence in relation to source libraries from which the clones were obtained. [0139] [Table 21 Source library Gene SEQ ID NO Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 6 Day 8 MaACL1 SEQ ID NO: 1 3 0 1 2 MaACL1 SEQ ID NO: 2 0 1 0 0 MaACL2 SEQ ID NO: 3 0 0 1 0 MaACL2 SEQ ID NO: 4 0 0 0 0 Example 2 [0140] (1) Cloning ofACL homologs SEQ ID NOs: I to 4 contain no CDS appearing to encode ACL. Thus, for cloning of cDNAs encoding the full lengths of these genes, primers were prepared based on each sequence as follows. Primers designed based on SEO ID NO: 2: Primer 422-1: GATACCGTCGTCAACTTTGCCTC (SEQ ID NO: 18) Primer 422-2: CATCTI'GCAGT-FGGGGTCCCGCT (SEQ ID NO: 19) Primers designed based on SEQ ID NO: 4: Primer 424-1: GTTGACACCGTGGTGAACTTTGCC (SEQ ID NO: 20) Primer 424-2: GCATCTTGCACCCGGATCCTTCTC (SEQ ID NO: 21) Using these primers, PCR was performed with ExTaq (Takara Bio Inc., Japan) by using a cDNA library containing ESTs constituting SEQ ID NO: 2 or 4 as a template. The resulting DNA fragments were TA-cloned with a TOPO-TA cloning Kit (INVITROGEN CORPORATION) to determine the nucleotide sequence for each insert. [0141] The results confirmed that DNA fragments covering nucleotides 3-443 of SEQ ID NO: 2 and nucleotides 6-449 of SEQ ID NO: 4 were each cloned. These plasmids were designated as pCR-422-P and pCR-424-P, respectively. [0142] Then, these plasmids were each used as a template to perform PCR with the above primers. In PCR, ExTaq (Takara Bio Inc., Japan) was used, but the attached dNTP mix was replaced by a PCR labeling mix (Roche Diagnostics) for digoxigenin (DIG) labeling of DNAs to be amplified, thereby preparing probes for use in cDNA library screening. These probes were used to screen the cDNA libraries from which the ESTs constituting the individual sequences had been obtained by EST analysis. [0143] Hybridization conditions were set as follows. Buffer: 5 x SSC, 1% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50% formamide Temperature: 42°C (overnight) Washing: in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C for 20 minutes (repeated three times) Detection was accomplished by using a DIG nucleic acid detection kit (Roche Diagnostics). From phage clones obtained by screening, the plasmids were excised by in vivo excision to determine the nucleotide sequence for each insert. Plasmids each carrying the longest insert obtained by screening with each probe were designated as pB-ACL1 and pB-ACL2, respectively. The nucleotide sequences of the inserts in pB-ACL1 and pBACL2 are shown in SEQ ID NOs: 5 and 6, respectively, and in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. SEQ ID NO: 5 was found to contain a CDS of 3540 bp (SEQ ID NO: 7), while SEQ ID NO: 6 was found to contain a CDS of 3525 bp (SEQ ID NO: 8), thus suggesting that cDNA encoding the full length of ATP:citrate lyase homolog was obtained for each case. These genes were designated as MaACL1 and MaACL2, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequences of proteins encoded by these genes (MaACLlp and MaACL2p) are shown in SEQ ID NO: 11 and SEQ ID NO: 12, respectively. [0144] (2) Sequence analysis The MaACL1 gene and the MaACL2 gene are homologous to each other and were found to share an identity of 79.1% in their CDSs (Figure 3). Likewise, they were found to share an identity of 87.1% in their deduced amino acid sequences (Figure 4). On the other hand, a Blast search against the NCB1 protein sequence database (nr) indicated that the highest identity was observed with a basidiomyceles U. maydis-derived ACL-like putative protein (gi_46096782), which shared an amino acid sequence identity of 61.6% with MaACLI and 61.9% with MaACL2. Moreover, MaACL1 and MaACL2 were also found to share a certain, but lower, identity with animal-derived ACL or ACL-like putative protein sequences including mouse (gi 29293809), human (gi_38569421), Drosophila (gi_ 28372804) and nematode (gi_17551266) (Figure 5). Example 3 [0145] (1) Construction of yeast expression vectors To express MaACL1 and MaACL2 in yeast cells, yeast expression vectors were constructed as follows. First, the plasmid pB-ACL1 was used as a template to perform PCR with ExTaq (Takara Bio Inc., Japan) using primers ACL1F-EX and ACLIR-HS. Primer ACL1F-EX: GAATTCTCTAGAATGTCTGCTAAAGCCGTTCGCG (SEQ ID NO: 22) Primer ACL1R-HS: AAGCTTGTCGACTFAGGCCTTCTTGTTGATCG (SEQ ID NO: 23) The PCR product was digested with restriction enzymes EcoRI and HindlII. The resulting DNA fragment was inserted into the EcoRI-HindlII site of vector pUC18 to obtain plasmid pUC-ACL1. This was digested with restriction enzymes EcoRl and Sail to obtain a DNA fragment of approximately 3.5 kbp, which was then inserted into the EcoRI-Sall site of vector pYE22m (Biosci. Biotech. Biochem., 59, pp. 1221-1228 (1995)) to obtain plasmid pYEMaACL1. On the other hand, the plasmid pB-ACL2 was digested with restriction enzymes Notl and Sail or digested with restriction enzymes Sail and KpnI to obtain a DNA fragment of approximately 2.7 kbp or approximately 1 kbp, respectively, pYE22m was digested with a restriction enzyme EcoRI and blunt-ended with a DNA Blunting Kit (Takara Bio Inc., Japan), followed by insertion of a NotI linker (pd(GCGGCCGC)) to obtain vector pYE22mN. This vector pYE22mN was digested with restriction enzymes NotI and KpnI, and linked to the Notl-SalI and SalI-Kpnl fragments of ACL2 prepared above to obtain plasmid pYEMaACL2. [0146] (2) Yeast transformation The plasmid pYE22m, pYEMaACLl or pYEMaACL2 was used to transform yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae stratin EH13-15 (trpl, MATer) (Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol., 30, 515-520 (1989)) by the lithium acetate method. The transformed strains were screened by the ability to grow on SC-Trp agar medium (2% agar) containing, per liter, 6.7 g Yeast nitrogen base w/o amino acids (DIFCO), 20 g glucose and 1.3 g amino acid powder (a mixture of 1.25 g adenine sulfate, 0.6 g arginine, 3 g aspartic acid, 3 g glutamic acid, 0.6 g histidine, 1.8 g leucine, 0.9 g lysine, 0.6 g methionine, 1.5 g phenylalanine, 11.25 g serine, 0.9 g tyrosine, 4.5 g valine, 6 g threonine and 0.6 g uracil). Example 4 [0147] (1) Yeast culture Among the transformed strains obtained with each vector, any two strains (strains c1 and c-2, strains MaACLI-I and MaACL1-2, or strains MaACL2-1 and MaACL2-2) were selected and cultured under the following conditions. Namely, in the pre-culture step, a loopful of each yeast strain was inoculated from the plate into SC-Trp medium (10 ml) and cultured with shaking at 30°C for 2 days. In the main culture step, the pre-cultured solution (1 ml) was added to SC-Trp medium (100 ml) and cultured with shaking at 30°C for 1 day. [0148] (2) Preparation of enzyme solutions Each cultured solution was centrifuged to collect the cells, which were then washed with 1/2 volumes of sterilized water. The cells were suspended in 5 ml extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF) and homogenized at 16 kPa with a French press, followed by centrifugation at 20,000 x g at 4°C for 10 minutes to collect the supernatant. The supernatant was applied to a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) filled with Shehadex G-25, and eluted with elution buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 1 mM MgClz, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT) to give an enzyme solution. [0149] (3) Measurement of ACL activity ACL activity was determined by measuring the amount of oxaloacetate generated during the ACL-catalyzed reaction shown below, which was determined from a reduction in NADH levels (measured as a change in A 340 (6.22 mM-lcm-L)) caused by the malate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction. [0150] [Formula 2] <ACL-catalyzed reaction> Citrate + CoA + ATP oxaloacetate + ADP + Pi + acetyl-CoA <Malate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction> Oxaloacetate + NADH ---, malate + NAD+ [0151] The reaction solution was prepared in a total volume of 1 ml containing 10 mM TrisHC1 (pH 8.4), 10 mM MgC1 2 , 1 mM DTI', 10 mM ATP, 10 mM citrate, 0.2 mM CoA, 6 units of malate dehydrogenase, 0.1 mM NADH and 50 1 enzyme solution. The reaction was initiated by addition of CoA. The reaction was performed at 28°C. [0152] The results obtained are shown in Table 3. When compared to strains c-1 and c-2, strains MaACLI-1 and MaACL1-2 or strains MaACL2-1 and MaACL2-2 were found to have higher ACL activity, suggesting that products of the MaACL1 and MaACL2 genes had ACL activity. [0153] [Table 31 Measurement of MaACL activity Strain [ c-1 I c-2[ MaACLI-1[ MaACL1-2 MaACL2-1 I MaACL2-2 ACL activity [ I I 20.94 1.15 [ 1.09 (nmol.min-l.mg-1) 0.80 0.98 30.96 [0154] Next, MaACL1 was studied for its dependence on Mg 2÷ concentration. Namely, the above ACL reaction solution was modified to have a MgCI 2 concentration of 5 mM, mM, 20 mM or 40 mM, and the activity was measured in the same manner. Figure 6 shows the relative activity, assuming that the activity at a MgCI 2 concentration of 10 mM was set to 1. [0155] As shown in Figure 6, ACL1 showed the maximum activity at an ATP:citrate:Mg- ÷ ratio of about 1:1:1. Example [0156] (1) Construction of Mortierella genomic library M. alpina strain 1S-4 was inoculated into 100 ml liquid medium (1% glucose, 0.5% yeast extract, pH 6.0) and cultured with shaking at 28°C for 4 days. The cells were collected by filtration with a filter and treated by the CTAB method to extract genomic DNA. [0157] The resulting genomic DNA (about 200 tg) was partially digested with a restriction enzyme Sau3AI, such that cleaved DNAs had a distribution whose center was located at around 20 kb. The resulting DNA fragments were subjected to 10% to 40% sucrose density gradient centrifugation (rotor SW28 (Beckman), 25,000 rpm, 10°C, 24 hours) and fractionated into 1 ml aliquots using an AUTOMATIC LIQUID CHARGER (ADVANTEC) and a MICRO TUBE PUMP (EYELA). A fraction having a distribution whose center was located at around 20 kbp was purified. The thus obtained genomic DNA fragments were treated with a k.BlueSTAR/BamHI vector kit (NOVAGEN) to prepare a genomic library. [0158] (2) Cloning of URA5 genomic DNA To use the Mortierella URA5 gene as a marker gene, its genomic DNA including promoter and terminator regions was cloned as follows. Namely, a probe was prepared based on the cDNA sequence of the Mortierella URA5 gene (Biosci Biotechnol Biochem., 68, pp. 277-285 (2004)) and used for screening from the Mortierella genomic library to identify a nucleotide sequence of approximately 2.1 kbp covering this gene (SEQ ID NO: 13). [0159] (3) Cloning of GAPDH homolog genomic DNA To constitutively and highly express a transgene in Mortierella cells, a homolog of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene, which is known to be constitutively and highly expressed in many organisms, was cloned. Based on the GAPDH homolog sequence (SEQ ID NO: 14) found among the ESTs obtained in Example l, primers ATGACCATCAAGATCGGCATCA (SEQ ID NO: 24) and TTAAGCATGATCCTTCTTGGCC (SEQ ID NO: 25) were prepared. These primers were used to prepare a probe in the same manner as shown in Exarnple 2 by using the Mortierella cDNA as a template, followed by screening from the genomic library to identify a nucleotide sequence of approximately 3 kbp covering the GAPDH homolog (SEQ ID NO: 15). Example 6 [0160] Construction of Mortierella expression vectors A 0.9 kb region upstream of the M. alpina GAPDH structural gene was amplified by PCR with primers: AAGCTTGATCACGTCGGGTGATGAGTTGCTGTTGAC (SEQ ID NO: 26); and GAATTCGATGTTGA_ATGTGTGGTGTG (SEQ ID NO: 27) and a 0.5 kb region downstream of the M. alpina GAPDH structural gene was amplified by PCR with primers: TCTAGATAAGAAAAGGGAGTGAATCG (SEQ ID NO: 28); and GCGGCCGCGATCCATGCACGGGTCCTTC (SEQ ID NO: 29) to clone the GAPDH promoter (SEQ ID NO: 16) and the GAPDH terminator (SEQ ID NO: 17). These were digested at the restriction enzyme sites added on the primers, i.e., at the HindlII and EcoRl sites and at the XbaI and NotI sites, respectively, and then inserted into the HindlIl/EcoRl site and the XbaI/NotI site on pBluescriptlI SK- (Stratagene), respectively. This plasmid was further blunt-ended at the ApaI site, into which 18SrDNA (0.9 kb) which had been prepared from plasmid pD4 (Appl Environ Microbiol., 66, pp. 4655-4661 (2000)) by digestion with Xbal and HindlII and the subsequent blunt ending was then integrated to prepare plasmid pBGptR. A Sail-digested fragment (2.1 kb) prepared from the genomic DNA of the M. alpina Ura5 gene including the promoter and terminator was inserted into the XhoI site of pBGptR to prepare vector pH001. Further, for insertion of a multicloning site, which is to facilitate introduction of a useful gene for production of PUFA, between GAPDH promoter and terminator, pH001 was digested at the Hindlll site 5'-terminal to the GAPDH promoter and al the NotI site 3'-terminal to the GAPDH terminator with the corresponding restriction enzymes and then blunt-ended, followed by self-ligation to destroy the HindlII and NotI sites in two steps, thereby constructing vector pH002. Oligonucleotides for multicioning site preparation: SC/MCS-F2: 5'-ctagcgcggccgcctcgagaagcttcccggggcatgcctgcagtctagag (SEQ ID NO: 30); and SC/MCS-R2: 5'-aattctctagactgcaggcatgccccgggaagcttctcgaggcggccgcg (SEQ ID NO: 31) were complementarily annealed to each other to give an EcoRI/Nhel overhang, which was then inserted into the EcoRl/Xbal site of pH002 to construct vector pH003. In vector pH003, EcoRI/XbaI/Pstl/SphI/SmaI/Hindlll/XbaI/Notl was available for use as a multicloning site. Next, two sites for an octanucleotide-recognizing restriction enzyme AscI were introduced outside the EcoRI and HindlII sites of pUC19 to construct vector pUCAA from which an insert can be excised in its entirety by AscI digestion. This pUCAA was digested with EcoRI/HindlIl and then blunt-ended, into which a blunt-ended insert (4.4 kb) obtained from pH003 by partial digestion with BssHII was then inserted to prepare vector pH004, pH004 was partially digested with EcoRl and then blunt-ended and further ligated to destroy the EcoRl site adjacent to BssHII, thereby constructing pDuraSC which serves as a basic vector for self-cloning. [0161] To highly express MaACL1 and MaACL2 in Mortierella cells, Mortierella expression vectors were constructed as follows. The plasmid pUC-ACL1 was digested with restriction enzymes XbaI and HindlII to give a DNA fragment of approximately 3.5 kbp. This DNA fragment was inserted into the XbaI-SalI site of the vector pDuraSC to construct plasmid pDuraSC-ACL1. On the other hand, the vector pDuraSC was digested with a restriction enzyme EcoRl, blunt-ended with a Blunting Kit and then digested with Xhol, while the plasmid pB-ACL2 was digested with a restriction enzyme Notl, bluntended with a Blunting Kit and then partially digested with Xhol to give a fragment of approximately 3.5 kbp. The resulting fragments were ligated to each other to construct plasmid pDuraSC-ACL2. Example 7 [0162] Transformation of Mortierella Uracil-auxotrophic strain Aura-3 derived from M. alpina as described in a patent document (WO2005/019437 entitled "Method of Breeding Lipid-Producing Fungus") was used as a host and transformed with the plasmid pDuraSC-ACL1 or pDuraSC-ACL2 by the particle delivery method. For screening of the transformed strains, SC agar medium was used (0.5% Yeast Nitrogen Base w/o Amino Acids and Ammonium Sulfate (Difco), 0.17% ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose, 0.002% adenine, 0.003% tyrosine, 0.0001% methionine, 0.0002% arginine, 0.0002% histidine, 0.0004% lysine, 0.0004% tryptophan, 0.0005% threonine, 0.0006% isoleucine, 0.0006% leucine, 0.0006% phenylalanine, and 2% agar). Example 8 [0163] Evaluation of Mortierella transformants (1) Transformed strains obtained with plasmid pDuraSC-ACL1 The resulting transformed strains were each inoculated into 4 ml GY medium (2% glucose, 1% yeast extract) and cultured with shaking at 28°C for 3 or 4 days. The cells were collected by filtration, and RNA was extracted with an RNeasy plant kit (QIAGEN). A SuperScript First-Strand system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) was used to synthesize cDNA, followed by RT-PCR with primers GCGTCATCCCCACCACTGTT (SEQ ID NO: 32) and GCTGGCGGGAGGAGTGCCAGCACG (SEQ ID NO: 33). [0164] As a result, among the individual transformed strains, those with high ACL1 expression levels were selected. These strains were each inoculated into a liquid medium (2% glucose, 1% yeast extract) and cultured with shaking at 28°C. On day 3 of culture, a 20% glucose solution was added to the culture solution in a volume of 1/20. On days 4, 6, 7 and 8 of culture, a portion of the cells were collected and freeze-dried. Fatty acids in the cells were derived into corresponding rnethyl esters and then extracted with hexane. After distilling off hexane, the fatty acids were analyzed by gas chromatography to quantify the content of fatty acids per cell. The results obtained are shown in Figure 7. [0165] As shown above, the Mortierella strains transformed to highly express the MaACL1 gene allowed an increase in the intracellular fat or oil content at the late stage of culture when compared to the wild-type strains. [0166] (2) Transformed strains obtained with plasmid pDuraSC-ACL2 The resulting transformed strains were each subcultured on SC agar medium to select 9 strains showing good growth. Further, the above selected strains were each inoculated into 4 ml GY medium (2% glucose, 1% yeast extract) and cultured with shaking at 28°C for 4 days. The cells were collected by filtration and freeze-dried. A portion (about 10-20 mg) of the dried cells was treated by the hydrochloric acid/methanol method to derive fatty acids in the cells into corresponding methyl esters, followed by extraction with hexane. After distilling off hexane, the fatty acids were analyzed by gas chromatography. As a result, strains having a higher intracellular content of fatty acids and a higher ratio of arachidonic acid in total fatty acids were selected and designated as MaACL2#1 and MaACL2#2, respectively. [0167] These strains were each inoculated into 4 ml GY medium and cultured with shaking at 28°C for 4 days. The cells were collected by filtration, and RNA was extracted with an RNeasy plant kit (QIAGEN). A SuperScript First-Strand system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) was used to synthesize cDNA. To confirm the expression of each gene from the introduced construct, the above cDNA was used as a template to perform PCR with ExTaq (Takara Bio Inc., Japan) in 25 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 55°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 1 minute by using a combination of the following primers: Primer MaGAPDHpfw: CACACCACACATTCAACATC (SEQ ID NO: 34); and Primer ACL2-R5: CGAAGCCGGCAAAGGCGGCAGTCG (SEQ ID NO: 35). As a result, these strains were confirmed to express the MaACL2 gene from the introduced construct. [0168] Moreover, these two strains and strain 1S-4 were each inoculated into 4 ml GY medium (n=3) and cultured with shaking at 28°C at 125 rpm. On day 3 of culture, 20% glucose (200 lal) was added, and culture was further continued until day 6. On day 6, all cells were collected by filtration and freeze-dried. A portion (about 10-20 mg) of the dried cells was treated by the hydrochloric acid/methanol method to derive fatty acids in the cells into corresponding methyl esters, followed by extraction with hexane. After distilling off hexane, the fatty acids were analyzed by gas chromatography. The intracellular fatty acid content and the arachidonic acid production per medium are summarized in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. [0169] [Table 4] Intracellular fatty acid content (%) MaACL2#1 MaACL2#2 1S-4 35.09-+ 3.27 35.95 _+ 2.99 33.67 --. 2.61 [0170] [Table 51 Arachidonic acid production per medium (g/L) MaACL2#1 MaACL2#2 2.00-+ 0.43 2.35 _+ 0.25 [0171] As shown above, the Mortierella strains transformed to highly express the MaACL2 gene allowed an increase in both intracellular fatty acid content and arachidonic acid production per medium when compared to the wild-type strain.
