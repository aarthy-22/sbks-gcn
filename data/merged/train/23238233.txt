Four new triterpenoid saponins from the leaves of Panax japonicus grown in southern Miyazaki Prefecture (4).
Four new dammarane-type triterpenoid saponins such as chikusetsusaponin LM3 (1), chikusetsusaponin LM4 (2), chikusetsusaponin LM5 (3), chikusetsusaponin LM6 (4), and twenty known triterpenoid saponins such as ginsenoside Rb3 (5), ginsenoside Rc (6), ginsenoside Rd (7), ginsenoside Re (8), ginsenoside Rg1 (9), ginsenoside F3 (10), ginsenoside F5 (11), ginsenoside F6 (12), chikusetsusaponin IVa (13), chikusetsusaponin V (14), chikusetsusaponin L5 (15), chikusetsusaponin L9a (16), chikusetsusaponin L9bc (17), chikusetsusaponin L10 (18), chikusetsusaponin FK2 (19), chikusetsusaponin FK6 (20), chikusetsusaponin FK7 (21), chikusetsusaponin FT1 (22), chikusetsusaponin LM1 (23), and chikusetsusaponin LM2 (24), were isolated from the leaves of Panax japonicus C. A. MEYER collected in Miyazaki prefecture, Japan.
The structures of new chikusetsusaponins were elucidated on the basis of spectral and physicochemical evidences.
