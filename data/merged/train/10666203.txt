Streptokinase-induced platelet activation involves antistreptokinase antibodies and cleavage of protease-activated receptor-1.
Streptokinase activates platelets, limiting its effectiveness as a thrombolytic agent.
The role of antistreptokinase antibodies and proteases in streptokinase-induced platelet activation was investigated.
Streptokinase induced localization of human IgG to the platelet surface, platelet aggregation, and thromboxane A(2) production.
These effects were inhibited by a monoclonal antibody to the platelet Fc receptor, IV.3.
The platelet response to streptokinase was also blocked by an antibody directed against the cleavage site of the platelet thrombin receptor, protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1), but not by hirudin or an active site thrombin inhibitor, Ro46-6240.
In plasma depleted of plasminogen, exogenous wild-type plasminogen, but not an inactive mutant protein, S(741)A plasminogen, supported platelet aggregation, suggesting that the protease cleaving PAR-1 was streptokinase-plasminogen.
Streptokinase-plasminogen cleaved a synthetic peptide corresponding to PAR-1, resulting in generation of PAR-1 tethered ligand sequence and selectively reduced binding of a cleavage-sensitive PAR-1 antibody in intact cells.
A combination of streptokinase, plasminogen, and antistreptokinase antibodies activated human erythroleukemic cells and was inhibited by pretreatment with IV.3 or pretreating the cells with the PAR-1 agonist SFLLRN, suggesting Fc receptor and PAR-1 interactions are necessary for cell activation in this system also.
Streptokinase-induced platelet activation is dependent on both antistreptokinase-Fc receptor interactions and cleavage of PAR-1.
